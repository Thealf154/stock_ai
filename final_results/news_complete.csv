MSFT,'We Are Going Up': New York Mets Owner Steve Cohen Identifies 'Big Wave' Of Opportunities In This Segment. Here's How He's Positioning His Bets,"Heightened interest rates have cast a shadow of doubt over stock market optimism, intensifying concerns of a looming economic downturn. Many experts have called for a recession.But billionaire hedge fund manager and New York Mets owner Steve Cohen is taking a bullish stance.“I’m making a prognostication — we’re going up,” he said at a private conference, according to Bloomberg.Cohen knows a thing or two about navigating the markets and rising to the top. After all, the hedge fund manager’s career inspired the character Bobby Axelrod, played by Damian Lewis in the TV show “Billions.”Noting that he’s “actually pretty bullish,” Cohen highlighted one specific segment in today’s market: artificial intelligence (AI).He warned that if investors become overly preoccupied with recession concerns, they might miss the “big wave” of opportunities in AI.The billionaire investor is putting his money where his mouth is. According to the latest Form 13F filing of his firm Point72 Asset Management, Cohen has placed quite a few bets in the AI arena. Here’s a look at three notable ones.Don't miss:'People-First' Real Estate Fund Shares Rent With Tenants While Generating Strong Returns For InvestorsElon Musk Issues Dire Warning For The Real Estate Market And This Investment Strategy Could Produce Massive Returns If He's RightAs the parent company of Google, Alphabet Inc. was created in 2015 to give Google’s wild ideas some room to play. The company boasts a vast array of ventures, from dominating the search engine market to dabbling in self-driving cars and life sciences.Commanding a market cap of over $1.5 trillion, Alphabet is a tech behemoth. But the stock can still be volatile. Shares plunged 39% in 2022 but have surged 37% so far in 2023.Some consider the increasing popularity of OpenAI's chatbot ChatGPT a threat to Alphabet's business. But Alphabet is not standing still, as the company is also advancing its own AI products.“In March, we introduced our experimental conversational AI service called Bard,” Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said in an earnings conference call last month. “We've since added our PaLM model to make it even more powerful, and Bard can now help people with programming and software development tasks, including code generation.”As of March 31, Cohen’s firm owned 3.31 million shares of Alphabet, worth $343.01 million at the time.Point72 Asset Management also held 980,638 shares of Nvidia, valued at $272.39 million at the end of March.Known for its graphics processing units (GPUs), Nvidia stock has been on a tear.Year to date, shares have shot up 120%.The rise of AI may have something to do with investor enthusiasm for the chipmaker.In an earnings release in February, Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang said that AI “is at an inflection point.”And that could present a major opportunity for the company.“We are set to help customers take advantage of breakthroughs in generative AI and large language models,” Huang said. “Our new AI supercomputer, with H100 and its Transformer Engine and Quantum-2 networking fabric, is in full production.”These days, it’s hard to discuss AI stocks without mentioning Microsoft. After all, it has made notable investments in ChatGPT maker OpenAI, and ChatGPT has taken the internet by storm.During the company’s latest earnings conference call, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said, “The age of AI is upon us, and Microsoft is powering it.”Indeed, Microsoft Azure — the software giant’s cloud computing arm — is OpenAI’s exclusive cloud provider.Nadella said that Microsoft will deploy OpenAI’s models across its consumer and enterprise products.Microsoft shares have climbed 33% in 2023, bringing the company’s market cap to $2.37 trillion.At the end of the first quarter, Cohen’s firm owned 449,115 shares of Microsoft, a stake valued at approximately $129.48 million at the time.Read next: How These Accredited Investors Pulled In Better Returns Than Warren BuffettWhile REITs Are Struggling, Private Market Real Estate Pulls In Huge Returns.© 2023 Benzinga.com.

MSFT,Microsoft says China approves its plan to buy video game-maker Activision Blizzard,"Microsoft said Friday that China has unconditionally approved its plan to buy video game company Activision Blizzard, even as the deal still faces antitrust opposition in the U.S. and United Kingdom.China and the European Union are the two biggest economies to have approved Microsoft's planned $69 billion takeover of the California game publisher behind popular titles such as World of Warcraft, Call of Duty and Candy Crush.China’s State Administration for Market Regulation cleared it without conditions, according to Microsoft, though as of late Friday the agency's website didn't mention the decision.Game sales in mainland China come with a requirement that game-makers work with a Chinese publisher to release titles in the country. And since earlier this year, popular Activision Blizzard franchises such as World of Warcraft, the StarCraft series, Overwatch and Diablo have been suspended because of a disagreement between Activision subsidiary Blizzard Entertainment and its Chinese partner, NetEase.But the U.S. company said late last year it would suspend most of its game services in China after current licensing agreements ended, leading to a public spat between the two companies.Microsoft says its planned Activision acquisition — considered the priciest tech deal in history — now has been cleared in 37 countries, which includes the 27 in the EU as well as 10 others such as China, Japan and Brazil. But the blockbuster deal is still in jeopardy because British regulators have rejected it and U.S. authorities are trying to thwart it.","May 19, 2023 at 4:43 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-says-china-approves-plan-214333499.html,AP Finance,0.0,0.0,-0.025000000000000005,0.39666666666666667,2023-05-19 16:43:00,2023-05-19 16:43:00,316.739990234375,318.3399963378906,-1.600006103515625
MSFT,Stock winners and losers amid market volatility,"Mahoney Asset Management CEO Ken Mahoney joins the Live Show to discuss two stocks to own, which stocks to avoid, and gives investing tips amid an uncertain market.Hey, it will have its ups and downs. Recognize the stock is going parabolic. The tactics that we use as kind of buy and hold, maybe 1/2 to 2/3. And maybe trade around and sell some [INAUDIBLE]. At the end of the day, this is where the leadership's going to be, and I still believe there's a lot more upside with Nvidia throughout the rest of the year, even though the stock's already doubled this year.And to me, again, if it's going be narrow leadership, be with the narrow leadership. If it's not going to spread out, it's not going to have strong breadth the way it's been shown, stick with the leaders. I mean, that's how we've been trained. Look at the best industry, the best stocks in those industry. Yes, they'll be volatile, but you're going to be more than compensated for that volatility.And every time there's a problem with just one of them, it comes back and hurts the region.

MSFT,Alibaba Makes Another Step Towards Unlocking Value,"Revenue for the quarter ended on March 31st amounted to $29.6 billion, missing estimates but rising 2% YoY. Although non-GAAP diluted earnings per share missed expectations as they amounted to 1.34 yuan, they were up 35% YoY. The adjusted net profit rose 38% YoY as it rose up to $4.0 billion.Like Amazon, Walmart and Home Depot, Alibaba observed a slow start of the year with total sales of physical goods. But China, where Alibaba operates generates almost half of the world’s global online transactions, saw its retail sales in April rise 18.4% and Alibaba said it already observed a positive momentum in March after the initial slowdown. However, results didn’t show the improvement for March as analysts had hoped.While Microsoft topped cloud expectations with its latest reported quarter, this unit was a weak spot during the reported quarter as sales dropped 3% YoY, mostly due to January’s delivery delays due to COVID-19 restrictions as well as a loss of top overseas customer. Even Amazon warned of a cloud growth slowdown in its latest reported quarter.What is also interesting is that Alibaba’s quarterly report also came with a mission statement of the Chinese titan working to make cloud computing more affordable and accessible.Alibaba’s cloud comes hand in hand with AI. Like Microsoft, Alibaba developed its own ChatGPT-style generative AI tool earlier this year which is expected to help accelerate customer adoption of its cloud computing service. CEO Daniel Zhang is expecting this technology to bring an exponential increase in computing power.Alibaba’s story continues to be written as the company has taken steps towards unlocking the value of its business. While its tech peers in the U.S. are cautiously turning around, Alibaba’s results have significantly improved, with the latest results being significantly stronger from last year’s comparable quarter. Considering that the latest quarter had the strongest growth rate in the fiscal year that was just closed, momentum is on Alibaba’s side. Meanwhile, both Microsoft and Amazon gave cautious and lackluster guidance. If other things remain equal and this trend continues, Alibaba could bring in significantly higher profits in the undergoing fiscal year.DISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

MSFT,EU antitrust regulators quiz cloud rivals on Microsoft's request for customer data,"By Foo Yun CheeBRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU antitrust regulators are asking Microsoft's rivals what kind of customer data they are required to provide to the U.S. tech giant as part of their Azure cloud contracts, six months after a trade group complained about its cloud computing practices.Cloud Infrastructure Services Providers in Europe (CISPE), whose members include Amazon, alleged last November that Microsoft's new contractual terms imposed on Oct. 1 together with other practices were harming the European cloud computing ecosystem.In a questionnaire sent to cloud providers seen by Reuters, the European Commission asked recipients for a list of contractual clauses requiring these companies to report information about their European customers to Microsoft.""The Commission has received several complaints regarding Microsoft, including in relation to its product Azure, which we are assessing based on our standard procedures,"" a spokesperson for the EU executive said.The EU competition enforcer wanted to know about the frequency of the reporting, the period for which the data is requested, the format of the reporting and whether the information is sent directly to Microsoft or to an auditor.Recipients, who were given until this week to respond, were asked whether there were contractual, actual or threatened consequences for not complying with these clauses.The EU watchdog asked if Microsoft may have used the information to go directly to the recipients' customers.Microsoft, hit by more than 1.6 billion euros ($1.8 billion) in EU fines in the previous decade for various antitrust violations, declined to comment.It has made an offer to CISPE in a bid to settle the issue and talks are ongoing, according to a person familiar with the matter.($1 = 0.9084 euro)(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee; Editing by Kirsten Donovan)","May 19, 2023 at 12:33 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/eu-antitrust-regulators-quiz-cloud-173312831.html,Reuters,0.0,0.0,0.058931419457735244,0.29804625199362045,2023-05-19 12:33:00,2023-05-19 12:33:00,316.739990234375,318.3399963378906,-1.600006103515625

MSFT,Artificial intelligence gives real boost to U.S. stock market,"By Lewis KrauskopfNEW YORK (Reuters) - Recent advances in artificial intelligence are fueling optimism over how businesses can operate more productively in the years ahead. They are also providing a big boost to the stock market.The S&P 500's 9% rally this year has been driven by a handful of the index's biggest stocks, a number of which are at the center of the AI frenzy that has spread in the wake of the chatbot sensation ChatGPT.Five stocks - Microsoft, Google parent Alphabet, Nvidia, Apple and Meta Platforms - are responsible for the S&P 500's entire year-to-date return, said Jessica Rabe, co-founder of DataTrek Research. About 25% to 50% of those gains are owed to ""the buzz around artificial intelligence,"" she noted.A recent Societe Generale analysis zeroed in on 20 stocks widely owned by AI-related exchange-traded funds, whose overall assets under management have grown almost 40% this year.Removing those stocks from the S&P 500 would reduce the index's performance by roughly 10 percentage points, putting stocks in negative territory for the year, SocGen's analysis showed.""It's the AI-driven stocks that are getting the strongest returns,"" said Manish Kabra, head of US equity strategy at SocGen. ""As a secular theme, for sure, it's attractive.""The rush of AI developments has analysts licking their lips at the profit potential stemming from new revenue opportunities and productivity improvements.Goldman Sachs strategists estimate that generative AI could create productivity gains that result in S&P 500 companies expanding profit margins by about 4 percentage points in a decade following widespread adoption.Indeed, optimism over AI is a key factor supporting a stock market facing numerous headwinds. Those include uncertainty over the U.S. Congress coming to agreement to raise the debt ceiling and avoid a default, and worries the economy may be on the verge of a downturn, as the Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes filter through the economy.""We are strongly of the view that AI will change the world,"" Jim Reid, strategist at Deutsche Bank, said in a note titled, ""Will ChatGPT prevent the US recession?""The AI excitement has helped propel hefty gains for some stocks. For example, shares of Microsoft, the second-largest U.S. company by market value, have climbed 32% this year. The software giant has grabbed headlines with its partnership with ChatGPT creator OpenAI and sprucing up its Bing search engine with AI.Shares of Nvidia, the fifth-biggest U.S. company by market value whose chips are central in the AI excitement, have soared 110% this year.The Global X Robotics & Artificial Intelligence ETF has jumped nearly 30% this year.Investors next week will be keeping an eye on developments regarding the U.S. debt ceiling, as well as inflation data and corporate earnings including results from Nvidia.Other factors have supported megacap stocks. Those include a decline in Treasury yields from last year's highs that has soothed concerns over tech valuations and investors viewing megacaps as safety plays in an uncertain environment.At the same time, even the shares of potentially transformative technologies are vulnerable to price bubbles, as history shows. A dotcom stock mania helped markets roar higher in the late 1990s, but a crash followed a few years later, leaving only a handful of internet names standing.A BofA Global Research report published Friday said AI stocks were in a ""baby bubble"" in comparison with far larger asset price moves seen in areas such as internet stocks and bitcoin over the last few decades.Nonetheless, many investors say that AI is no fad.King Lip, chief strategist at Baker Avenue Wealth Management in San Francisco, calls the developments in AI a ""game changer."" His firm owns shares of Microsoft, Nvidia and Alphabet.""It goes beyond the next shiny object,"" Lip said. ""The path is pretty clear on how generative AI can lead to earnings growth for these companies.""(Reporting by Lewis Krauskopf; Editing by Ira Iosebashvili and Richard Chang)","May 19, 2023 at 11:38 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/artificial-intelligence-gives-real-boost-163808896.html,Reuters,-0.19999999999999998,0.65,-0.0016060606060606046,0.4578686868686869,2023-05-19 11:38:00,2023-05-19 11:38:00,316.739990234375,318.3399963378906,-1.600006103515625

Microsoft uses Twitter’s API in several products, including Xbox One, Bing Pages, Azure and Power Platform.But last month, the Redmond, Washington-based company said its social media planning and scheduling tools for advertisers would no longer support Twitter. Musk at the time responded by accusing Microsoft of “illegally using Twitter data” and threatening a lawsuit.Microsoft said in an emailed statement it had received Twitter’s letter and will review the questions. “We look forward to continuing our long term partnership with the company,” it said.Musk, who is also CEO of Tesla Inc. and SpaceX, bought Twitter for $44 billion in October. Since then, he has slashed staff and stiffed vendors amid declining advertising revenue.The letter, reported earlier by the New York Times, comes as Twitter changes the company’s policy to charge businesses for access to its stream of data.Musk has also publicly criticized Microsoft’s investment in ChatGPT maker OpenAI, which the billionaire co-founded before leaving in 2018.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekApple’s New Headset Meets RealityJapan’s New Military Might Is Rising in a Factory in HiroshimaESG Investing Goes Quiet After Blistering Republican AttacksThe True Cost of an Extended US Debt-Ceiling StandoffSweetgreen Tests Robots to Make Faster, More Efficient Sad Desk Salads©2023 Bloomberg L.P.","May 18, 2023 at 10:22 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/musk-lawyer-sends-letter-microsoft-032255036.html,Bloomberg,0.0,0.0,0.025624667729930883,0.3360978203083467,2023-05-18 22:22:00,2023-05-19 10:30:00,316.739990234375,318.3399963378906,-1.600006103515625
MSFT,"Elon Musk's lawyer accuses Microsoft of misusing Twitter data, demands audit","SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — A lawyer for Twitter owner Elon Musk accused Microsoft of misusing the service’s data and demanded an audit from the software giant.The letter primarily addresses a seemingly narrow set of alleged infractions by Microsoft in drawing information from Twitter’s database of tweets. But the move could foreshadow more serious developments. Musk has previously accused Microsoft and its partner OpenAI in a tweet of “illegally” using Twitter data to develop sophisticated AI systems such as ChatGPT.But the letter, signed by Musk lawyer Alex Spiro, tiptoed around that concern. It noted that Microsoft's agreement with Twitter barred it from overuse of the service's data such as exceeding “reasonable request volume"" or “excessive or abusive usage.” Spiro then noted that “despite these limitations,” Microsoft had retrieved more than 26 billion tweets in 2022 alone.He provided no context for those numbers. The process of training AI systems requires enormous amounts of data such as written text, which AI algorithms scour for patterns that the AI can use to make sense of language and large bodies of knowledge.In other respects, the letter primarily laid out a series of vaguely worded allegations. For instance, it noted that while Microsoft was required to inform Twitter about its intended use of the data, it failed to do so for six of the eight Microsoft apps that drew on information from the Twitter database.Similarly, the letter asserted that at least one Microsoft app had supplied Twitter data to a number of virtual locations that “reference a government entity or agency.” That apparently violated Microsoft's agreement with Twitter, the letter stated, which prohibited the company from retrieving Twitter data “on behalf of ‘any government-related entity’” without first notifying Twitter.The letter stated that Microsoft had failed to provide such notification.Microsoft spokesman Frank Shaw provided a statement noting that Microsoft will review questions raised by the letter and then will “respond appropriately.” The statement added that “we look forward to continuing our long term partnership” with Twitter, which it did not refer to by name. Shaw declined to address specifics from the letter.Spiro's letter demanded that Microsoft describe in detail the Twitter data it possesses or has previously destroyed, the purpose for each of its apps that drew on Twitter information, and any government entities that used these Microsoft apps and whether they received data from Twitter's database.","May 18, 2023 at 8:44 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/twitter-accuses-microsoft-misusing-data-014412300.html,AP Finance,0.0,0.0,-0.0063350340136054395,0.4781037414965987,2023-05-18 20:44:00,2023-05-19 10:30:00,316.739990234375,318.3399963378906,-1.600006103515625
MSFT,25 Most Technologically Advanced Cities in the World,"After COVID-19, 2023 will likely be a gloomier year for technology. Due to geopolitical and economic instability, the next stage of technology growth is being handled with greater caution. Leaders will need to find ways to accomplish more with fewer resources, see opportunities where innovations collide, and choose wisely which technologies to invest in when they approach a tipping point.Technology advances are crucial to the creation of smart cities. Urban settings may be made more effective, sustainable, and livable with the help of modern technology. Modern data-driven technologies can help address environmental issues, reduce resource consumption, optimize urban infrastructure, and improve the quality of life for city dwellers. Examples include digital water systems, smart grids, digital transportation, data-driven traffic management, and Internet of Things (IoT) applications.However, there are challenges that should be considered and addressed, such as how fast urbanization might cause a housing crisis or how a lackluster internet infrastructure can cause sustainability problems. City planners may construct resilient, livable, and inclusive cities that successfully handle the issues of overcrowding and mass urban migration while enhancing the general quality of life for urban people by placing a high priority on holistic urban sustainability.Soon, AI-enabled Edge servers may examine multiple video feeds from store aisle cameras to look for large amounts of merchandise being removed at once and monitor deliveries to help retailers better manage their inventory and quickly cope with supply and demand, enhancing sales and earnings and ensuring consumers receive in return of their heavy investment.yuttana Contributor Studio/Shutterstock.comSo, without further delay, let us examine the list of the 25 most technologically advanced cities globally.Number of tech startups = 168There are about 101,000 ICT workers in Stockholm.

The deal marks the first offtake agreement by Frontier, a coalition backed by the tech companies that aims to spend nearly $1 billion on permanent carbon removals.Frontier represents a growing array of major companies including McKinsey, JPMorgan and H&M. The purchase represents a major step forward for the carbon-removal industry, which relies on emerging technology and remains a fledgling market. The offtake agreement with Charm — which is a legally binding contract to buy future tons of carbon removal at a set price — signals that the startup and the carbon-removal industry at large are starting to ramp up.“Over the past three years, Charm has gone from concept to delivering thousands of tons in a relatively short period of time, which is a demonstration of great execution. This team is moving very quickly,” said Nan Ransohoff, who heads Frontier and also serves as the top climate executive at digital-payments company Stripe.Founded in 2018, Charm is one of the first carbon removal startups to have successfully stored carbon dioxide permanently underground. It pioneered a unique way to remove and store carbon by taking waste biomass, transforming it into bio-oil, and injecting it deep underground where it’s stored permanently.So far, Charm has removed more than 6,000 tons of CO2. The Frontier agreement will require the company to rapidly scale up its solution.The company has had its share of growing pains since launching its bio-oil sequestration efforts. While it removed thousands of tons of CO2 in 2021, that number ticked down significantly in 2022. Reinhardt said he expects removals to ramp back up to the thousands of tons this year as the company has rebuilt its supply chain and made changes to its processes.He said that most of bio-oil the company has sequestered so far has been purchased rather than created using it own technology. Still, he is confident that Charm will be able to successfully scale up its process drastically to meet the demands of the Frontier deal. To get there, Charm will have to build and upgrade around 10 new machines that transform waste biomass into bio-oil — known as pyrolyzers — as well as deploy mobile facilities. “We’ll start doing some of that this year. But the pace of movement between sites will probably pick up over the years to come,” he said.For startups like Charm, the investment from Frontier is worth more than just the contract itself. There are a growing number of would-be buyers of carbon removal services, but many don’t have the time or resources to properly vet the range of startups selling them. The carbon-removal purchases are a part of an unregulated and voluntary carbon market. Frontier, though, has a team of more than 50 scientists and technical reviewers, helping the young industry gain traction.“It helps quite a bit with fundraising, and it shows that there’s a lot of demand,” Charm co-founder and chief executive officer Peter Reinhardt said. “It shows that the most rigorous buyer in the space combed through everything, believes in what we’re doing and has validated our scientific perspective.”At $53 million, Reinhardt said the deal “dwarfs” all of Charm’s other removal contracts. The price will cover the costs of removing and storing CO2 as well as measuring, reporting and verifying to ensure that it’s done correctly. Frontier’s purchase will average roughly $470 per ton over the course of the contract, but the price per given ton will depend on a number of factors, including the possibility of expanded government incentives and Charm’s scaling plan.Ransohoff said one of the appeals of Charm is its potential to remove CO2 at a much lower cost of $100 per ton. That’s the price at which many experts believe the technology will need to reach to become economically feasible at scale. The world’s race to net zero may require removing billions of tons of CO2 a year by mid-century. The industry currently removes a few thousand tons, and that’s what makes deals done now so crucial for ensuring the industry has the runway to scale.Today, Charm customers start paying for removals at $600 per ton, Reinhardt said. Conservatively, he expects the price to drop to $100 per ton by 2040.Up until this deal, Frontier had committed only $500,000 in pre-purchase agreements with early-stage startups. Although the funding amounts are smaller, these agreements give removal suppliers funds upfront with the hope that it will fast-track technological development.“These are really early companies that are just getting started. And candidly, some of them are going to deliver tons, and some of them won’t, and that’s okay,” Ransohoff said of those deals. She expects the bulk of the tons removed to come from Frontier’s offtake funding track, which is expected to make several more deals later this year. Each will likely be in the tens of millions of dollars.Frontier is not alone in the race to commercialize carbon removal. Last year, in a separate initiative called the First Movers Coalition, Microsoft and Salesforce pledged to spend $300 million on removal services.Earlier this week Microsoft announced that it had agreed to purchase 2.76 million tons of carbon removal credits from Danish utility company Orsted A/S. The deal will be for carbon captured at the smokestacks of two plants burning biomass and stored under the North Sea over the next 11 years. Because the trees captured carbon dioxide from the air as they grew, Microsoft is counting the the overall process to be carbon removal. How effective that project is will depend on rigorous accounting as previous analyses have found CO2 emissions from cutting down and transporting trees can often be higher than the CO2 trapped by the trees alone.--With assistance from Akshat Rathi.(Adds new details about Charm’s plans to scale in paragraphs seven and eight.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekApple’s New Headset Meets RealityThe True Cost of an Extended US Debt-Ceiling StandoffJapan’s New Military Might Is Rising in a Factory in HiroshimaSweetgreen Tests Robots to Make Faster, More Efficient Sad Desk SaladsRecession Calls Keep Getting Pushed Back, Giving Soft Landing Believers Hope©2023 Bloomberg L.P.","May 18, 2023 at 4:14 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/frontier-carbon-removal-fund-just-211457375.html,Bloomberg,0.0,0.0,0.15790488660859034,0.4582246628542925,2023-05-18 16:14:00,2023-05-18 16:14:00,314.5299987792969,318.5199890136719,-3.989990234375
MSFT,Billionaire David Teppers 2023 Portfolio: Top 15 Stock Picks,"After a tumultuous 2022 and a start to 2023 that saw markets focus on whether the Federal Reserve would finally end its interest rate hiking cycle and if this would cause a recession, over the past couple of months a new complication has made its way into the financial markets. This is the U.S. debt ceiling, and it sits right at the heart of the American economy and by extension, the global economy. The debt ceiling is decided by Congress, and it serves as a check for the executive branch - or the Treasury Department under the President - to limit the amount of money that it can borrow to meet debt repayments.The back and forth between the president and Congress for this ceiling has often created turmoil in the financial market. In fact, this tussle also caused S&P Global Ratings to downgrade U.S. government debt to AA+ from AAA in 2011 - the first and only time in history that America received a downgrade which is often reserved for developing countries with fiscal mismanagement. The impact of this downgrade on the stock markets was immediate, with all major indexes declining by as much as seven percent in the aftermath.Our Methodology Appaloosa Management's Q1 2023 Investment: $31 million Tesla, Inc.

MSFT,"150,000 Laid-Off Tech Workers Fuel Massive Wave Of New Startups And They're Actually Making More","In 2023, tech layoffs continue throughout various firms:Tech hiring took off during the pandemic as the societal shift toward digital services meant technology firms needed to innovate and meet demand. Some of these firms overhired during this period, as their management overestimated growth targets. Growth slowed as the pandemic eased, interest rates rose, and inflation cut into personal spending and increased many business expenses. Tech companies also need capital to invest in artificial intelligence (AI) or other innovations, and reducing staffing is one way to generate cash.Privately held firms are also laying off employees in moves similar to publicly traded firms like Amazon and Microsoft. Fintech firm Stripe Inc. laid off 14% of its workforce in late 2022. The privately held firm also saw a steep decline in its internal market value in 2021 and 2022.Other private tech firms are also experiencing steep drops in valuations. European ""buy now, pay later"" firm Klarna Bank AB noted in 2022 that its valuation was $6.7 billion after a recent investment, an 85% drop from its valuation the previous year.Amid these private company layoffs are reports of current and recently laid off employees selling private shares, as they need capital in the face of falling valuations. Another driver for private share selling is the low number of initial public offerings (IPOs), which reached the lowest point in 20 years in 2022. The lack of potential windfalls from an IPO pushed more employees to sell some of their private shares, which then drops their companies' valuations. Lower valuations impact a company's ability to raise additional capital and strain the available venture capital funds.One of many impacts of the job cuts from 2022 that continue into 2023 is it adds many engineers, coders, business development workers and others back into the job market. Many of these workers will find employment with other tech firms, but others will take the opportunity to launch their own startups.A survey of 1,000 laid-off tech workers conducted by Clarify Capital LLC found 63% of the respondents started their own company after their layoff. And tech workers reported they made more money after starting a company.Accelerator Y Combinator reported a jump in startup applications of 20% in 2022 and noted the number of applications filed in January 2023 was five times higher than the previous year. An increase in startups creates new jobs and presents an investment opportunity for venture capitalists and individual investors to capitalize on exciting new startup opportunities.Collaborative Robots Startup Using Teams Of AI-Powered Drones To Make Flying SaferAI Startups Turn to Retail Investors To Fund the Growth of the $1.59 Trillion Artificial Intelligence Market.© 2023 Benzinga.com.

MSFT,Grammarly Wants to Expand Its AI From the Classroom to the Office,"(Bloomberg) -- Grammarly Inc., a software company known for its writing assistant, is expanding its artificial intelligence offerings in the workplace.Most Read from BloombergMcCarthy Puts Debt-Limit Talks on ‘Pause’ as Clock Ticks DownDisney Closes Florida Star Wars Hotel, Scraps Plan to Move 2,000 EmployeesMorgan Stanley CEO Gorman to Step Down Within 12 MonthsWall Street Fears $1 Trillion Aftershock From Debt DealNYC Skyscrapers Sit Vacant, Exposing Risk City Never PredictedIn June, the company is rolling out new features for its enterprise offering, Grammarly Business, including business-specific terms and knowledge in its AI-powered communication assistant called GrammarlyGo. At an event on Tuesday, the company laid out its roadmap for an AI-connected workplace, which eventually will include the capability to summarize key points in a long email string, identifying whether the information is already shared within the organization and composing a reply. Grammarly also aims to connect to other common office applications such as Slack and Gmail, identify priority tasks for employees and compose a response to colleagues across different messaging apps.“We’ve been helping our users with AI to communicate more effectively for over a decade, now it’s time to go beyond words,” Grammarly Chief Executive Officer Rahul Roy-Chowdhury said at the event.Read More: A Cheat Sheet to AI Buzzwords and Their MeaningsThe move is part of San Francisco-based Grammarly’s effort to ride the generative AI wave and pivot from a grammar-and-spelling checker to a corporate communications and workflow tool. Generative AI uses huge amounts of data to produce text or images in response to a prompt. Grammarly’s software will face fierce competition from big technology companies such as Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Microsoft Corp., which are adding artificial intelligence features to their popular office products.Roy-Chowdhury, who became CEO May 1 after serving as head of product, started at Grammarly after 14 years at Google working on products including the Chrome browser. He said Grammarly Business will help customers connect all the fragmented apps they use for recruiting, human resources software, messaging and email.“If a business wants to truly benefit from generative AI, it should be integrated across all applications used by employees,” he said. “Particularly as people write across various platforms and applications, being present where they are can allow for constant learning and automation of workflows and will ultimately save time and promote creativity.”Google and Microsoft already have announced similar offerings. In March, Google said it will integrate generative AI tools into its Workspace suite including Gmail, Docs, Slides and Sheets. Microsoft also introduced an AI assistant — called Dynamics 365 Copilot — for applications that handle tasks such as sales, marketing and customer service. Based on technology from OpenAI, the software can draft contextual chat and email answers to customer service queries, help marketers come up with client categories to target and write product listings for e-commerce.Grammarly, which has 30 million daily active users, recently launched GrammarlyGO, a generative AI feature that lets users brainstorm ideas, write, edit and personalize text. Using technology from Microsoft Azure, Grammarly’s models review outputs for bias and the tool can fine-tune the style for users by clicking on prompt tabs like “make it persuasive,” “make it assertive” and “sound confident.”Roy-Chowdhury said generative AI technology is changing rapidly. “I’m happy to see how it evolves and we’ll always find the best technical solutions to help our users,” he said.(Updates with detail on product in second paragraph.

MSFT,Q2 2023 Altigen Communications Inc Earnings Call,"Carolyn David; VP of Finance & IR Officer; Altigen Communications, Inc.Jeremiah J. Fleming; Chairman, President & CEO; Altigen Communications, Inc.Chris SchreiberMaj Soueidan; Co-Founder; Geoinvesting, LLCNeil CataldiOperatorCarolyn DavidJeremiah J. FlemingCarolyn DavidJeremiah J. FlemingOperator(Operator Instructions) The first question is from Neil Cataldi with Blueprint.Neil CataldiJerry, nice quarter. Cloud services growing 4% sequentially is definitely a good sign of, hopefully, what's coming. A few questions, if I may, to dig a little deeper. Regarding Fiserv, you mentioned the customers who've deployed your solution thus far. Can you talk about engagement size? What is the largest active customer generating per month in terms of revenue? And are they fully deployed today?Jeremiah J. FlemingYes. That's good questions, Neil. And like you said, hey, 4%, that's a start, right? And we expect that to continue to improve. Regarding Fiserv, it ranges based on the size of the customer. Actually, the size of the deployment maybe is a better answer. And so the good revenue is really driven by the contact center. So we probably have a low end of around $5,000 a month, and our largest to date, of these 3, not a penny more, is around $25,000 a month in revenue. And that would be based (inaudible)Neil CataldiOkay. So your largest -- yes. So your largest customer with the contact center today is generating $25,000 a month. That's great. And then sort of same question but on the TRUSTID side, how should we think about that? And what are the customers there already generating?Jeremiah J. FlemingYes. Well, this is definitely just getting started, okay? So as I mentioned, we've got 1,500 IVR customers to target. Finally, the -- we've delivered on our capabilities and Fiserv has delivered on the integration they need on their side. So we have 2 customers live on the platform today. The one -- now the first customer that uses only TRUSTID, not the voice biometrics but only TRUSTID, that revenue is $5,000 a month. The customer that we've newly signed -- actually, this is only -- this solution doesn't have the contact center, by the way. They have both the TRUSTID as well as the voice biometrics, and that's about $8,000 a month just for that secure SIP service. These are -- so that's the first 2 of 1,500.Neil CataldiGot it. That's great. So those are good case studies. It sounds like we finally got some customers fully paying, and it's really just a question now of when, not so much if. One more question regarding Fiserv. Do they have any personnel dedicated to the sales operation? And maybe for those newer to the story that might be listening, since the Altigen products are white labeled to them, are they only selling your unified communications product? I mean they're not selling anyone else. It's just you, correct?Jeremiah J. FlemingNeil CataldiOkay. Great. One more on Fiserv with the migrations you touched on. Is there any way you can quantify what the up-sell revenue opportunity is with the 30 that need to be migrated by the end of this year?Jeremiah J. FlemingNeil CataldiIs it a similar range to the other contact center customers you were just discussing, $5,000 to $25,000?Jeremiah J. FlemingYes. For those customers, yes. For those customers that choose, yes, the contact center, the full omni-channel, absolutely because the $5,000 is basic. The $25,000, yes, they've got the full boat. So yes, to the extent that those customers choose the full boat. And again, it depends. It's not like a one size fits all, so it depends how many agents as well are utilizing the solution. So -- and the customers vary in size. But yes, we'll see that same range, that roughly the 30-plus contact center customers that I mentioned that will be migrating out of the 90, 30 have contact center. Yes, then I would expect to see that $5,000 to $25,000, I'm sorry, range monthly once those customers are fully deployed in the cloud.Neil CataldiOkay. Great. And then one last one, different topic. You talked a little bit about ZAACT and new opportunities for them. I just wanted to clarify, do you mean opportunities specific to Altigen products? Or are they pursuing other professional services development projects unrelated to what we might call the regular Altigen growth initiatives?Jeremiah J. FlemingOperatorThe next question is from Maj Soueidan with Geoinvesting.Maj SoueidanThank, Jerry, for taking this question. A real quick one. I just have one question regarding resellers. I think when you were in Vegas with our chat, you had talked about looking to bring on some new resellers to help you sell some of your products. I was wondering if you could get more specific in terms of what these resellers -- how they're different than what the resellers you may have right now and what you're hoping to gain from them in terms of product deployment.Jeremiah J. FlemingMaj SoueidanThat's fine. I mean, have they given you any kind of feedback on the products and how they -- the advantages they might have? I mean, do they kind of confirm what you're talking about? And then when you do sign them up, can you give me an idea of how long it might take for them to get like a runway where they could start getting the product out there?Jeremiah J. FlemingMaj SoueidanExcellent. I guess good to hear. And I have one more question. Just doing some research around the industry and talking to other companies in the industry. Some of the -- there's a trend that's kind of been brought up to me, where you're seeing some maybe of the larger players in the industry maybe not taking -- paying too much attention maybe to the second and third tier kind of their own clients and maybe paying more attention to their top bigger clients? Are you seeing that same trend? And do you see that an opportunity you guys can pursue at all? I mean I wonder if you're just seeing the same thing.Jeremiah J. FlemingWell, so many of these -- we really focus on the larger -- by the way, when I say enterprise customers for us, I'm talking about an organization of 500 to 5,000 people, okay? Not the General Motors of the world, right? But these are still very large companies whose operations are predominantly in the U.S. and then if they're not in the U.S., in the U.K., where we can properly support them. But the smaller customers that maybe second and third tier, those are brought to us by resellers, so that's not our outward push. We do secure a number of those and that, I don't know, Maj. I really can't -- I haven't seen it. It doesn't mean it's not happening, but I don't -- what Microsoft has done that helps us out a little bit, they've made some discounts on their licensing for those smaller companies, so those customers can get into Teams' phone system. And that does create additional opportunities for us to then sell our applications on top of Teams' phone system, so that's probably the biggest benefit that we would see.Maj SoueidanOkay. And then one last question. I mean at what point do you say to yourself, hey, you have some traction here. The stock is trading at $0.50, $0.60. Where do you -- when do you make the decision as a company to say, hey, we got to go on there and do something with the stock and do a tender offer, buy some stock or something? Because I mean it's getting to the point, I think, where I think the market needs to see that, to some degree, that you're serious about what's going on here and you back it up, right? So I'm wondering if you can talk about that a little bit.Jeremiah J. FlemingWell, I know you're a large shareholder. You know I'm a large shareholder. And of course, that is never far from top of mind. What I'll tell you right at the moment, and we've had questions about this, and I've had conversations with the Board of Directors. At the moment, we've made -- really, our first job, in my opinion, and the director's opinion, job one, get these products out the door, get them working, build the momentum, right? Let's put our investment in that. If we do not get rewarded for our performance, let's take some shares out of the market. That's the general feeling.Operator(Operator Instructions) We have one question coming from Chris Schreiber with Taglich.Chris SchreiberI just had a couple of real quick questions and a follow-up to Maj's. How many employees do you have right now in the company?Jeremiah J. FlemingCarolyn, can I defer to you on that? Around 70. But Carolyn might give a...Carolyn DavidThat is correct. We're right around 70.Chris SchreiberAnd the 70 -- so you have 4 business lines. Do they interchange business lines? Or is there a specific number towards one business?Jeremiah J. FlemingYes, that's a good question. So let me try to answer it as best as I can. So we have -- there's a kind of a wide big group of, I'll call, shared services, right, that includes G&A and support services and deployment services that cuts across all the businesses, and they're cross-trained. And then we have specific areas of focus mostly on the sales and marketing side and then on the development side as well. So sales and marketing, on one hand, for those lines of business, plus development because the developers are specialized in those -- each of those 4 lines of business. And so that's how we're able to accomplish that. And specifically, let me address Fiserv. For example, we don't have a tremendous number of resources on Fiserv because they have a tremendous number of resources on our solutions, so it does vary on how much we put into a particular LOB.Chris SchreiberOkay. And then I have one other question. Just following up on what Maj's comments were. I see that you -- I assume you don't have an IR consultant anymore. What are you doing? I'm sorry. Go ahead.Jeremiah J. FlemingGo ahead. Sorry, I thought you were done. I apologize.Chris SchreiberSo what are you doing to go out and tell the story? I understand you were at that Vegas conference. But do you have anyone to plate inside or outside that's dedicated to getting out and telling the story?Jeremiah J. FlemingWell, we don't at the moment. But I will have to tell you, there is a method to the madness and I'm not sure if you're affiliated with IR firms. But the money we were spending with the IR firm, there was not the return on the investment. And so we have to make decisions. I'm not going to put money into an IR firm to not bring any new shareholders into the fold. Are we going to put that money into the business to grow it? At which time, we're going to start attracting new shareholders as a result of our business performance, and that was the decision that I made.Chris SchreiberOkay. Well, respectfully, it doesn't hurt to get out on the road, whether you're hiring an IR guy or you just getting out into conferences and talking to investors.Jeremiah J. FlemingI hear you. I would -- not sure I agree with you, but I hear you.Chris SchreiberOkay. Well, Jerry, let me just -- let me touch upon this. Like if you look at all the old transcripts, I think this is the first time in probably 3 years you've had more than 1 or 2 perhaps. This is the first time in 3 years, I think, that you've had 3 guys on the call.Jeremiah J. FlemingSo [lease] question. So you're absolutely correct. Yes. But is there a question there?Chris SchreiberYes. But I mean -- so it's like -- I think you guys have got to look at that, right?Jeremiah J. FlemingOkay. I'm not sure what the comment is. We have more than 3 people on the call, so I'm not sure what the comment is.Chris SchreiberWell, guys that ask questions. If you look at the old transcripts, you can see that. And I'm just telling you, I just really believe you need to go out and find new investors. And if you don't have a good IR firm, find somebody. Just this is my...Jeremiah J. FlemingWe're well aware of that. I'm not sure -- I'm sorry, I'm not trying to be argumentative. I'm not sure what the argument is. So we don't have an IR firm, yet we have more people asking questions. I'm not sure how that ties in with the argument that we should have an IR firm. Sorry, I don't understand.Chris SchreiberI'm friends with Neil. That's why I'm in the stock, okay?Jeremiah J. FlemingOkay. Neil is a good IR man.Chris SchreiberAnd I know [Brett], and I'm just being very direct with you. Like I've been buying stock and I'm very frustrated as an investor. And if you just look at all the last transcripts and all the acquisitions and all of the -- hey, we're going to do this, this and this, it's extremely frustrating. If you're an investor for -- you've been there for 15 years, I think. You guys have got to get out and tell the story. I'm just being very -- I'm trying to be respectful. It's just very frustrating. It's kind of like (inaudible)Jeremiah J. FlemingI hear you. Can we have a one-on-one call? I think that might be more productive, if you don't mind. I'm certainly interested in your perspective, yes. But I would love to have that with you.Chris SchreiberOkay. Thank you.Jeremiah J. FlemingAnd I don't disagree with you. Don't get me wrong. I don't disagree. What I was trying to say is that at the moment, right, while we're building this market, that we still have to make the decision where the best use of our expenses are. And that my decision what the best use wasn't at this moment on IR. Now this is a temporary situation. I'm not expecting -- we're not going to -- we'll never have an IR firm. I'm just saying at the moment. But well, you and I can talk about that and more than happy to hear your input.OperatorOkay. We have no further questions in queue. I'd like to turn it back to management for any closing remarks.Jeremiah J. FlemingOkay. Well, thank you, operator. And yes, so apparently, guys, we will take a look at the IR situation. I'll say that. It sounds like tongue in cheek, but I'm serious about that. And we certainly do appreciate your participation. I just want to reiterate at the moment, we are focused, heads down, get these solutions out the door, start building momentum, that everyone can see that's demonstrated in terms of revenue. That is what we're focused on. And so we certainly look forward to giving you guys updates on our subsequent calls and hopefully demonstrating that performance. So thank you very much, everyone, for participating.Carolyn DavidThank you, everyone.OperatorThis concludes today's conference, and you may disconnect your lines at this time.

MSFT,"Zacks Earnings Trends Highlights: KB Home, Amazon and Microsoft","Chicago, IL – May 18, 2023– Zacks Director of Research Sheraz Mian says, ""Earnings estimates for full-year 2023 appear to have reversed course lately after consistently coming down for almost a year from the April 2022 peak.""The picture emerging from the Q1 earnings season continues to be one of resilience and stability, with companies not only beating estimates but also providing a good-enough outlook in an uncertain macro environment. This is helping the revision trend to turn positive lately after remaining negative for almost a year.Earnings estimates for full-year 2023 appear to have reversed course lately after consistently coming down for almost a year since the April 2022 peak.Since the start of 2023 Q2, full-year 2023 earnings estimates have increased for 10 of the 16 Zacks sectors, with Construction, Industrials, Autos, Retail, and Tech enjoying favorable estimate revisions. Estimates have come down for the Energy, Basic Materials, Transportation, Conglomerates, and Aerospace sectors.The earnings picture defied the skeptics again in the 2023 Q1 earnings season, with companies not only handily beating estimates but also providing reassuring enough guidance for the current coming quarters.We are not suggesting that earnings are great because they are not. After all, earnings growth is on track to be negative for the second quarter in a row, with the trend of declining profits expected to continue in the current period.That said, the fear of all-around downbeat guidance and management commentary still remains just that, a fear. As a result, we continue to elude the earnings cliff that the market bears have been telling us for a while.Perhaps it's only a question of time, with the day of reckoning only being deferred to the second half of the year. But for now, at least, we can feel relieved that the earnings picture is good enough.There are so many examples of bellwether companies showing that while growth has come down and conditions remain challenging, they are still profitably operating. Consumers are still spending, though there are signs of weakness at the margin.The Q1 earnings season appears to have caused stabilization in the earnings estimate revisions trend that was consistently negative for almost a year. In fact, since the start of 2023 Q2 in April, full-year 2023 earnings estimates in the aggregate have actually increased a bit, with estimates for 9 of the 16 Zacks sectors modestly up in that period.The favorable reversal in the revisions trend is particularly notable for the Construction, Industrial Products, Retail, and Technology sectors. As we noted last week, you can see this in the revisions trend for a few bellwether players for these sectors, like KB Home KBH on the Construction side, Amazon AMZN for Retail, and Microsoft MSFT for the Tech sector.It is hard to know how enduring or otherwise this favorable recent turn in the revisions trend will be, but it is nevertheless a positive development.The Earnings Big PictureAs we have pointed out all along, aggregate earnings estimates for 2023 peaked in April last year and consistently came down since then. Even accounting for the aforementioned positive revisions trend in recent weeks, aggregate 2023 earnings estimates have declined by -12.7% since the April 2022 peak and -14.2% on an ex-Energy basis.Hard to tell at this stage if the revisions trend will remain on its recent positive trajectory or revert back to its original negative trend. But it is nevertheless a market-friendly development.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

MSFT,"Senators say they failed to act on social media, won't make same mistake with AI","Wednesday, May 17, 2023If the senators gathered for the Senate Judiciary Committee’s hearing on AI on Tuesday seem to agree on one thing, it’s that they don’t want to miss the opportunity to regulate AI like they did social media.The gist of the legislators’ warnings came down to the potential for AI being used to influence consumers, generate disinformation, or reinforce bias.“We had the same choice when we faced social media. We failed to seize that moment,” Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) said. “Now we have the obligation to do it on AI before the threats and risks become real.”During the hearing, Altman, Montgomery, and Marcus each told the gathered senators that Congress should put at least some kind legislation into place to govern the use of AI. Altman and Marcus in particular called for a new regulatory body that could provide the appropriate licenses for companies to deploy different types of AI.Without those, the witnesses said, AI could present its own unique set of problems.“Fundamentally, these new systems are going to be destabilizing,” Marcus said in his opening testimony. “They can and will create persuasive lies at a scale humanity's never seen before. Outsiders will use them to affect our elections. Insiders to manipulate our markets and our political systems. Democracy itself is threatened.”Altman, for his part, said he has his own set of fears about AI. “I think if this technology goes wrong, it could go quite wrong,” he said. “And we want to be vocal about that. We want to work with the government to prevent that from happening.”Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), meanwhile, questioned whether AI could be used to influence public opinion.For years members of Congress have called for stricter regulations over social media content.There’s a handful of reasons social media has avoided regulations, including a lack of consensus on just how to do it. Section 230, which serves as the backbone of the modern internet, is a frequent target of both Democrats and Republicans. But neither side can agree on why.Democrats say they want to hold sites accountable for what their users post, especially when it comes to disinformation, while Republicans say they want to go after sites for over-moderating content.Privacy regulation, meanwhile, has been in the works for years, but here we are in 2023 and there’s no true national data privacy law.While Congress hasn’t been able to pull anything together with regards to social media or privacy, it looks as though there might be hope for AI regulation.Still, it’ll likely be some time before any kind of regulation sees the light of day. Blumenthal himself said that Tuesday’s hearing was the first of a number to come. But with the pace at which AI is advancing, that could be too long for Congress to wait.Click here for the latest technology business news, reviews, and useful articles on tech and gadgetsRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance","May 17, 2023 at 2:52 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/senators-say-they-failed-to-act-on-social-media-wont-make-same-mistake-with-ai-195217014.html,Yahoo Finance,-0.15555555555555556,0.1638888888888889,0.11924371924371925,0.48627298627298615,2023-05-17 14:52:00,2023-05-17 14:52:00,312.2900085449219,314.0,-1.709991455078125

MSFT,Microsoft-Activision deal contends with conflicting rulings,"Yahoo Finance tech editor Dan Howley joins the Live Show to discuss the U.K.'s conflict with Microsoft's Activision Deal and Microsoft's future growth plans.Microsoft and Activision Blizzard can appeal those. They can fight the lawsuit that the FTC has brought, they can appeal the decision by the Competition and Markets Authority in the UK if they are able to show in the US that the EU is correct in its ruling and that, look, we have these guarantees. We're going to work with Sony. We're going to work with Nintendo, with Nvidia.We already have deals in place with Nintendo and Nvidia where we'll provide ""Call of Duty""-- that's the game that they're all talking about-- with 10 years of content. Then, perhaps, the FTC can say, OK-- or a judge can say, OK, you're satisfying the concerns that the FTC has there.If that happens, then what happens in the UK? Well, if Activision Blizzard and Microsoft can't appeal or lose the appeal there, some of the experts I spoke to say they might just carve out the UK on its own, set up a secondary business where they'll just operate as they do now, separate entities.And on the global scale, you would have Microsoft and Activision being able to offer their services as one. So you would have-- basically, what Microsoft wants to do is make its Cloud Gaming platform the best in the world. Frankly, it is right now, as far as offerings go and capabilities. And then they'll be able to grow in the mobile gaming space, another part that a lot of people aren't talking about, but an important piece of this discussion.Now, they would be able to do that everywhere else in the world. People would be able to play games on their smartphones that they otherwise wouldn't be able to do because of Cloud Gaming. And then the UK would just be left, kind of, in the dust. And perhaps, down the line, that would change.But it looks like, if they are able to go forward in the US, then the UK will just be left behind.","May 17, 2023 at 10:50 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/microsoft-activision-deal-contends-conflicting-155022760.html,Yahoo Finance Video,0.0,0.0,0.2717893217893218,0.5201770451770452,2023-05-17 10:50:00,2023-05-17 10:50:00,312.2900085449219,314.0,-1.709991455078125

MSFT,Hunt urges competition chiefs to encourage growth after Microsoft deal blocked,"Jeremy Hunt has told competition chiefs that they must “understand their wider responsibilities” after the regulator was attacked by Microsoft for blocking a gaming mega-merger.The Chancellor insisted that he did not want to undermine the independence of the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), but said regulators also needed to focus on encouraging investment.Speaking at the British Chambers of Commerce annual conference on Wednesday, Mr Hunt said: “When it comes to Microsoft, there was a merger between two American companies that the US regulator is seeking to block, and the UK regulator took the same view.“I think one of the reasons that companies like Microsoft and Google want to invest in the UK is because we have independent regulators that are not controlled by politicians and therefore they can be confident there will be a level playing field.“I would not want to undermine that at all, but I do think it’s important all our regulators understand their wider responsibilities for economic growth.“But for our tech sector, it isn’t just about being able to get through big deals, competition really matters.”The comments are the first Mr Hunt has made on the blocked takeover bid.Last week the Government published a “strategic steer” document encouraging the CMA to take into account “the impact that [enforcement] has on economic growth”.When the deal was blocked, Activision said the decision meant the UK was “clearly closed for business” and said it would reconsider its investments in Britain.The CMA’s leaders defended their decision on Tuesday, telling MPs that they had not created a “hostile environment” for tech businesses.Sarah Cardell, the regulator’s chief executive, said that the decision to block Microsoft’s takeover of Activision was taken by an independent panel.Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

MSFT,Ciscos Cloudy Growth Outlook Puts Stock in Shadow of Big Tech,"(Bloomberg) -- While big tech stocks have fueled the market’s advance in 2023, Cisco Systems Inc. has been a notable exception.Most Read from BloombergHere’s How Much Wealth You Need to Join the Richest 1% GloballyMercedes Sets Out to Make Sexy Vans With Yacht-Like InteriorsJPMorgan Asset Says Markets Are Right to Bet on US Rate CutsDebt-Limit Talks to Intensify as Biden Set to Depart for JapanAs the likes of Alphabet Inc., Microsoft Corp., and Apple Inc. have lit up the Nasdaq 100 Index with gains exceeding 30%, the biggest maker of computer networking equipment is slightly negative for the year.The underperformance is nothing new for Cisco, whose shares have stagnated for five years and remain more than 40% below a record hit in 2000. While the firm ticks some of the defensive boxes that have served as a boost to big tech this year, its growth is expected to slow in coming years at a time when investors are seeking acceleration.“Cisco is in that in-between space, not growing fast enough to be attractive as a growth name, and it isn’t so cheap that I really like it as a value stock,” said Siddharth Singhai, chief investment officer at Ironhold Capital Management, whose firm doesn’t own the shares but has been looking into it.The problem is not so much current growth rates, but what analysts expect to be a future slowdown. Ahead of third-quarter results due after Wednesday’s close, estimates point to a 9.7% increase in revenue this fiscal year, which would be the fastest pace since 2010. Looking further out, the pace is expected to slow to 4.4% in fiscal 2024 and continue decelerating for at least the two years after that.In contrast, growth rates at rival Microsoft Corp. are expected to bottom in fiscal 2023 before accelerating going forward, a trend that holds for the tech sector overall, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.Cisco’s drab outlook is reflected in its valuation. The stock trades at roughly 12 times forward earnings, a discount to its 10-year average, as well as the Nasdaq 100. It also offers one of the highest free-cash-flow yields among index components, as well as one of the highest indicated dividend yields among stocks in the tech sector.According to JPMorgan Chase & Co. analysts, the valuation is likely to limit downside risk, although they recognize “more bearish outcomes” are possible with the results. Cisco has beaten earnings expectations every quarter for more than a decade, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Aash Shah, senior portfolio manager with Summit Global Investments, is among those who favor the stock as a defensive holding.“It doesn’t have a sexy growth story, but it has rock-solid financials, it is a cash-flow machine, it pays a solid dividend, and it is much cheaper than the high-growth tech stocks,” he said.Singhai at Ironhold Capital Management agrees that Cisco is “a lot more attractive than the high-flying names that haven’t delivered on profits or which have no cash flow.”“The returns you get from it should be fairly stable,” he said. “However, we’re not too excited about how big those returns could be.”Tech Chart of the DayNvidia Corp. shares have doubled in 2023, pushing the chipmaker’s market value beyond Berkshire Hathaway Inc. After closing at its highest since January 2022 on Tuesday, the company has a capitalization of about $722 billion compared with the $712 billion of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire.

MSFT,10 Least Regulated Industries and Businesses,"The relationship between the corporate sector and the government is a love-hate affair. At one end, companies are often eager to gain subsidies and favorable capital use regulations from the government. On the other, the government is the only entity capable of preventing abuses of power from companies to ensure that both the consumer and workers remain insulated against the ill effects of potential corporate greed.After the war, and once the Reconstruction Era ended, the American economy boomed. This led to America becoming the world's premier industrial economy, surpassing Great Britain which had led previously. At the same time, since the U.S. was unaccustomed to big business back then, this also led to the creation of some of the world's biggest monopolies. Three of these are the most well known, namely Standard Oil, Carnegie Steel, and the American Tobacco Company. All three of these firms had controlled nearly all of their markets which led them to create devastating policies aimed at stifling competition.Okay, so Standard Oil would have been rich. What's wrong with that? This question brings us to the importance of regulating the corporate world. Well, Standard Oil's monopoly did not directly harm the customer but it drove competitors out of the market by using its scale to drive down prices so that consumers would prefer its products and smaller competitors would be unable to maintain healthy business margins. In the long run, though, this does harm consumers since a lack of alternatives forces them to be left at the mercy of only one firm which can then decide to do whatever it wants.Standard Oil's actions contributed to the passage of the Sherman Antitrust Act which then also led to a lawsuit against one of the world's largest technology companies today, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). Microsoft came in the cross hairs of the U.S. government in the 1990s after it was accused of using its dominant market position in the computer operating system market to force users to also use the Internet Explorer browser. In fact, the case led the District Court to recommend a breakup of the company, especially since it controlled nearly all of the operating system market and had used this position to harm consumers - in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act. However, fortunately for the firm, the Circuit Court overturned this decision, and the Justice Department negotiated a settlement with the firm.The UK cloud gaming market is growing fast. Monthly active users in the UK more than tripled from the start of 2021 to the end of 2022. It is forecast to be worth up to £11 billion globally and £1 billion in the UK by 2026. By way of comparison, sales of recorded music in the UK in 2021 amounted to £1.1billion.Microsoft has a strong position in cloud gaming services and the evidence available to the CMA showed that Microsoft would find it commercially beneficial to make Activision’s games exclusive to its own cloud gaming service.Microsoft already accounts for an estimated 60-70% of global cloud gaming services and has other important strengths in cloud gaming from owning Xbox, the leading PC operating system (Windows) and a global cloud computing infrastructure (Azure and Xbox Cloud Gaming).The deal would reinforce Microsoft’s advantage in the market by giving it control over important gaming content such as Call of Duty, Overwatch, and World of Warcraft. The evidence available to the CMA indicates that, absent the merger, Activision would start providing games via cloud platforms in the foreseeable future.The cloud allows UK gamers to avoid buying expensive gaming consoles and PCs and gives them much more flexibility and choice as to how they play. Allowing Microsoft to take such a strong position in the cloud gaming market just as it begins to grow rapidly would risk undermining the innovation that is crucial to the development of these opportunities.With these details in mind, let's take a look at some of the least regulated industries.Suwin/Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyNumber of Federal Regulations in 2020: 49,609The utility industry is at the heart of every country's economy and national security. Power grids and dams are sensitive installations, and they are considered fair game during a time of war due to their potential of disrupting an enemy's industrial capacity. This market is made up of a variety of players, such as natural gas and electricity suppliers. According to the Labor Department, there were half a million people employed in the U.S. in this sector as of January 2023 - remaining relatively static over the year.Number of Federal Regulations in 2020: 46,079The Health Care and Social Assistance and social assistance sector is one of the biggest in America. America is famous throughout the world for its high healthcare costs. Americans are also often left bearing ludicrous costs for simple facilities such as having to go to the emergency room.Number of Federal Regulations in 2020: 29,924 A rather interesting case study involving regulations comes in the form of public administration and government. Essentially, it's about the sector responsible for making regulations also being regulated itself. Public administration is governed by a variety of regulations.Number of Federal Regulations in 2020: 29,252 The arts industry is naturally one of the more popular ones. Firms are regulated on what content they can produce and stopped from copying others.Number of Federal Regulations in 2020: 22,778 The mining and oil industry, like utilities, is central to progress. It also sees some of the loudest calls for regulations since firms in the industry often end up harming the environment.  Suggested Articles:10 Best Diversified Bank Stocks to Buy NowWarren Buffett’s $5.7 Billion Dividend Portfolio: Top 15 PicksBest Housing Stocks To Buy","May 17, 2023 at 8:23 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-least-regulated-industries-businesses-132415925.html,Insider Monkey,-0.3,0.4,0.09564495530012772,0.45118044152526904,2023-05-17 08:23:00,2023-05-17 08:23:00,312.2900085449219,314.0,-1.709991455078125
MSFT,"Ketchup from the cloud: Kraft Heinz debuts 'Remix,' its personalized sauce dispenser","On Tuesday, Kraft Heinz introduced its customizable, futuristic digital sauce dispenser that took its team just six months to build.How does it work? The 2.5-foot wide, 2.5-foot deep sauce dispenser features a large touchscreen that offers customers a choice of four bases: Heinz Ketchup, Ranch, 57 Sauce, and BBQ Sauce. Plus, what it's calling enhancers, which currently include Jalapeño, Smoky Chipotle, Buffalo, and Mango. Customers can customize the intensity level of the enhancers (low, medium and high).You'll have to wait though, the Remix is set to debut in-person at the 2023 National Restaurant Association Show in Chicago next week and then in certain restaurants in late 2023 to early 2024. Where? ""Those conversations across the industry are starting and will be ongoing for the next few months,"" said Peter Hall, Kraft Heinz U.S. Away from Home President.Hall called the opportunities for the dispenser ""limitless."" Some likely places: movie theaters, ballparks, football stadiums, schools, college cafeterias, theme parks, and even army bases.One goal of the machine is efficiency. After customers choose their sauces and insert the cup manually, it will take 8 to 10 seconds for the sauce to pour into the cup. The machine uses a ""unique vortex mixing technology where the sauce is pulled down to the center to ensure it's a clean and simple mix every time,"" Kraft Heinz VP of Disruption Alan Kleinerman said.Workers can swiftly replace the ingredient bags. ""It's a simple drop the bag in, snap it in,"" Kleinerman said. Another timesaver for operators: the machine, the execs said, only needs to be filled once a day.""If we see consumers are mixing ketchup with smoky Chipotle and Jalapeño at a really high rate, restaurant operators want to know that,"" Kleinerman explained.

MSFT,PulteGroup and Vornado Realty have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,"Chicago, IL – May 17, 2023 – Zacks Equity Research shares PulteGroup PHM as the Bull of the Day and Vornado Realty Trust VNO as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Microsoft MSFT, Activision Blizzard ATVI and Sony's SONY.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:The reason that PHM is a Zacks #1 Rank now is that analysts launched their consensus estimates since that report from full-year EPS of $7.44 to $9.05.And next year's profit haul also moved higher from $7.24 to $9.00 per share.This rebound may mark the earnings trough not only for many homebuilders, but for real estate in general.This past weekend I published an article about the ""possible peak"" in my real estate-focused newsletter Multifamily Investing.You can read the full version at the link but here is a synopsis...The US economy is doing a pretty good job of absorbing the regional banking crisis.Despite the persistence of digital banks runs -- with short-sellers preying on blood in the water to drive out deposits by pummeling stock prices -- the stock market has held up well and the Federal Reserve signaled a pause in their efforts to battle inflation.Meanwhile, job creation, consumer spending, and housing markets remain strong according to a collection of robust data sets.This scenario sets up ""the pause"" for the Fed with interest rate hikes.That diverse body of economists, with tons of data and analysis at their disposal, has done a good amount to tamp down wildfire inflation.And while the yield curve will remain inverted for some time, the message is clear that they have taken a big bite out of the cost surges.So now we are seeing inflation stabilize across many sectors. Sure, 5-7% inflation in some sectors like Food & Energy are alarming.But what matters now to investors is the trend direction and speed.And that trend is showing a new downward trajectory in inflation and a slowing in the rate of acceleration in either direction.History shows that this pattern leads to the fire being put out.Especially in the age of exponential technologies that tend to foster hyper productivity and disinflation. Honestly, when was the last time you had to worry about sending a check, a document, a photo, or yourself for a signature when they can all be done now instantaneously?While I thought the regional banking crisis would have a bigger negative impact on mortgage lending than the positives of the Fed pause, I'm starting to reconsider that idea.In their article for Forbes Advisor, Mortgage Rate Forecast For 2023, Robin Rothstein and Chris Jennings (Editor) suggest that the inflation battle is being won and the market is recognizing this...Recent data indicates the Fed's tightening policy seems to be working, though some analysts say too well, given the ongoing turmoil in the banking sector. Nevertheless, headline inflation cooled to 5% in March for the first time in nearly two years and is well below its June 2022 peak of 9.1%. Even so, the current rate is still far above the Fed's 2% goal.The good thing about this article is that they quote a variety of real estate-focused economists and analysts sharing their views of the unfolding interest rate landscape.On the alarmed end of the spectrum comes this...""The latest interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve is unnecessary and harmful,"" said Lawrence Yun, chief economist at the National Association of Realtors, in an emailed statement. ""(Small regional banks) are becoming zombie-like banks, unable to lend even to good businesses as they are more concerned with balance sheet shuffling for survival. This situation will worsen with each additional rate hike by the Federal Reserve.""Among the optimists were these forecasts...National Association of Realtors (NAR). ""[F]orecasts that ... mortgage rates will drop—with the 30-year fixed mortgage rate progressively falling to 6.0% this year and to 5.6% in 2024.""Compass U.S. region president, Neda Navab. ""There have been signals that mortgage interest rates may be at or near their peak, given recent encouraging news around inflation and a corresponding drop in the U.S. Treasury yields that help set mortgage rates. A sustained drop could push mortgage rates into the 5% range late in the second quarter or in the second half of 2023, but that's definitely not guaranteed.""Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA). ""Long-term rates have already peaked. We expect that 30-year mortgage rates will end 2023 at 5.2%.""We've seen this movie before and it usually gets resolved after some customary political brinkmanship.But the Forbes Advisor piece does share some additional views, including the idea that the uncertainty and potential for default will keep rates elevated into the summer.This remains the wild card for the spring home-buying season.The good news is that digital-centric financial markets are extremely quick at absorbing new information (good or bad) and discounting new trends.This means that barring a tumultuous US default event, inflation and rates are trending down, the regional bank crisis volatility is being absorbed by much bigger banks, and national lenders, builders, and investors will be modeling for rates in the 5% handle.And if the economy avoids recession, then all the bargains I was expecting in the Multifamily space may not unfold either. To learn more, check out this on-demand educational webinar from Mike Morawski where he goes over the return dynamics, underwriting traps, and tax advantages of Multifamily Investing...Creating Generational WealthMike has some great slides in there that illustrate what I call the ""power laws"" of Cash Flow and Equity Build.Bottom line: We could still get more Regional Bank scares, but the intelligence of the market discounting machine has weighed and measured what these failures mean and found them lacking in systemic or economic impact. I am surprised by this, but then again, this is a feature and not a bug of US economic resilience as I talked about in my recent vlog...Dollar Destruction Hysteria: Why the Panic is Wrong, AgainVornado exited first-quarter 2023 with cash and cash equivalents of $890.9 million, slightly up from $889.7 million as of Dec 31, 2022.The EU's decision is seen as positive for competition and is expected to give a boost to the cloud streaming market, which currently makes up a small percentage of the overall gaming industry.The EU's viewpoint contrasts with that of the U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority and the US Federal Trade Commission, both of which had reservations about the deal. The main difference in opinions seems to revolve around how quickly the cloud gaming market will grow in the future.Overall, Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard has received EU approval but the deal's ultimate success depends on overcoming legal hurdles in the United States and the U.K. The decision by the EU shows confidence in the potential benefits of competition and growth of the cloud gaming market.The main problem with the acquisition is regarding the competition. Microsoft's gaming division would have too much of the industry, which could unfairly limit its competitors and ultimately harm consumers.In the United States, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) wants to stop Microsoft from buying Activision, as they believe it could have negative effects. The U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is also concerned that the deal could lead to higher prices and fewer options for gamers in the U.K.Although the deal is approved by the EU, it may not go through. The U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) had a dissenting opinion last month. CMA had cited cloud gaming market as a concern, which is now agreed by Microsoft. This could make the difference in CMA's decision.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is building an Xbox mobile store, which will offer games directly to mobile devices. Microsoft wants to add Activision Blizzard content to this store to build on its already existing communities of gamers.For fiscal fourth-quarter Microsoft expects Xbox content and services revenue growth in the low to mid-teens due to third-party and first-party content, as well as Xbox Game Pass.Microsoft's shares have gained 30.6% year to date, whereas the Zacks Computer and Technology sector have grown 22.7%.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

Nadella pushed back on that claim and went further in saying that small players very much have a chance to compete against large firms like his and Alphabet Inc.’s Google.The Microsoft CEO said OpenAI’s board was steering the ship, contradicting Musk, who pulled out of the startup years ago and has advocated slowing AI development over potential ethical concerns.“OpenAI is very grounded in their mission of being controlled by a nonprofit board,” Nadella said. “We have a non-controlling interest in it, we have a great commercial partnership in it.”The ability of smaller companies to break into AI will “depend on product-market fit” and it’s not guaranteed that Microsoft and Google will be “the only two games in town,” Nadella said.Nadella pointed to search as an example of how AI has sparked fresh competition in a space dominated by Google’s engine.“Who would have thought? Last year if you were sitting here and somebody had said to you, ‘well, you know what, there will be a real contest around search and people may actually even dream that there’s an alternative to Google,’” Nadella said, citing Bing and ChatGPT as rising competitors.“There are lots of other folks who have entered the search market.

Alphabet had sold off in the first quarter amid fears that OpenAI's ChatGPT could be incorporated into Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT) rival Bing search engine, potentially disrupting Google's dominant search franchise.","May 16, 2023 at 3:47 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/m/a2e2b743-72c2-32ed-8ed3-dba84807ac31/why-alphabet-stock-rallied-on.html,Motley Fool,0.0,0.0,0.16308080808080808,0.43267676767676766,2023-05-16 15:47:00,2023-05-16 15:47:00,309.1541601521514,311.0599975585937,-1.9058374064422878

MSFT,Congress took on AI regulation and raised a lot more questions than answers,"OpenAI CEO Sam Altman testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee Tuesday to discuss possible regulation of artificial intelligence and next steps. The bottom line? Many questions; few, if any, answers.Senator John Kennedy (R-La.) pressed on the practical steps that Congress can take – and Marcus and Altman obliged.""Number one, a safety review, like we use with the [Federal Drug Administration] prior to widespread deployment,"" said Marcus. ""If you're going to introduce something to 100 million people, somebody has to have their eyeballs on it... Number two, a nimble monitoring agency to follow what's going on, not just pre-review, but also post as things are out there in the world, with the authority to call things back.""Marcus added that there should also be funding focused on AI safety research and building an ""AI constitution.""For Altman's part, he also called for an AI-focused regulating entity and regulation of AI overall.""I would form a new agency that licenses any effort above a certain scale of capabilities, and can take that license away and ensure compliance with safety standards,"" he said. ""Number two, I would create a set of safety standards...We can give your office a longer list of things that we think are important there, but (there should be) specific tests a model has to pass before it can be deployed in the world.""Altman also said that it will be important to include ""independent audits"" from ""experts who can say that the model is or isn't in compliance with state and safety thresholds.""Yahoo Finance spoke to two outside experts about the hearing directly in its aftermath.Khaled added: ""For example, if an AI system causes harm, who’s at fault? Is it the creators? The operators? The training data sources? The system itself? The consequences of getting it wrong have never been higher.”""There are still a lot of open questions on how we ensure AI is used to advance humanity and benefit everyone,"" he said. ""With how fast AI is moving, it's great to see the involvement and commitment from leading companies and the US government to ensure this is used properly.""The idea of an AI-specific agency received a lot of air time. But it also posed more questions and few answers. For example, IBM's Montgomery initially received pushback from Senators for her concerns that efforts to build an agency could take too long and be limited in its ability to regulate the new age of AI. One reason: a lack of proper funding and other resources, a point that some lawmakers came to her defense on.""Most of my career has been in enforcement and, I'm telling you, you can create ten new agencies, but if you don't give them the resources – I'm not just talking about dollars, I'm talking about scientific expertise –you guys will run circles around us,"" said Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), who convened the hearing. ""It isn't just the [AI models] that will run circles around [those agencies], but it's the scientists in your company. For every success story in government regulation, you can think of five failures.""Still, the government is going to need to do something – and NYU's Marcus noted that there are certain types of AI usage that are more important to regulate than others, like those in the medical world.""We have systems that hallucinate things, and they're going to hallucinate medical advice,"" Marcus told the Senators. ""Some of the advice they'll give us is good, some of it bad. We need really tight regulation around that, the same with psychiatric advice – people are using these things as kinds of ersatz therapists. I think we need to be very concerned about that.""But, the challenge for lawmakers is this: ""How?""","May 16, 2023 at 1:55 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/congress-took-on-ai-regulation--and-raised-a-lot-more-questions-than-answers-185553310.html,Yahoo Finance,0.5,0.5,0.08805916305916307,0.3744829244829245,2023-05-16 13:55:00,2023-05-16 13:55:00,309.1541601521514,311.0599975585937,-1.9058374064422878
MSFT,OpenAI CEO calls on government to regulate AI,"OpenAI CEO Sam Altman testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday, calling on Congress to pass legislation to regulate the development of AI at a time when the technology is gaining traction across the tech industry and beyond.“We think that regulatory intervention by governments will be critical to mitigate the risks of increasingly powerful models,” Altman said in his opening remarks.“For example, the US government might consider a combination of licensing and testing requirements for development and release of AI models above a threshold of capabilities.”Both IBM Chief Privacy and Trust Officer Christina Montgomery and NYU Professor Gary Marcus, who also testified during the hearing, similarly called for regulating AI and making the technology more transparent so that users know when they are interacting with AI.During the hearing, Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) illustrated the power of generative AI by using a version of ChatGPT trained on his prior floor speeches and a type of AI voice cloning software to read a completely made up opening statement that sounded like something Blumenthal might have said on his own.“If you were listening from home, you might have thought that voice was mine and the words from me, but in fact, that voice was not mine. The words were not mine,” Blumenthal explained.Senators raised several questions throughout the hearing about the potential for AI to be used to manipulate elections or cause other real-world harms.“Is it going to be like the printing press? That diffused knowledge and power and learning widely across the landscape that empowered ordinary everyday individuals that lead to greater flourishing, that lead above all to greater liberty?” Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) asked.“Or is it going to be more like the atom bomb? Huge technological breakthrough, but the consequences severe, terrible, continue to haunt us to this day?”Altman, meanwhile, said that he sees the technology as a “printing press moment.” But when pressed about the potential for misuse, the CEO said he is looking toward the government for help.“My worst fears are that we, the field, the technology, the industry, cause significant harm to the world,” Altman said. “I think if this technology goes wrong, it could go quite wrong. And we want to be vocal about that. We want to work with the government to prevent that from happening.”Both Altman and Marcus called on senators to create a new regulatory body that can monitor AI companies and provide licenses to deploy AI models.Sen. Lindsay Graham (R-S.C.) equated the idea to how energy companies need licenses to build nuclear power plants.While the roughly three-hour hearing saw plenty of questions from senators, there was little in the way of concrete next steps.And as senators and witnesses pointed out repeatedly, the technology will continue to advance regardless of whether regulations are put in place or not.Click here for the latest technology business news, reviews, and useful articles on tech and gadgetsRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance","May 16, 2023 at 1:32 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/openai-ceo-calls-on-government-to-regulate-ai-183229884.html,Yahoo Finance,0.0,0.0,0.04114304812834225,0.5501336898395721,2023-05-16 13:32:00,2023-05-16 13:32:00,309.1541601521514,311.0599975585937,-1.9058374064422878
MSFT,Microsoft researchers say GPT-4 shows 'sparks' of human-level performance,"Microsoft researchers recently released a paper that claims artificial intelligence technology has exhibited ability that is ""strikingly close to human-level performance.""The paper's authors contend that GPT-4 is part of a new cohort of large language models – including ChatGPT and Google's PaLM – that show more general intelligence than previous AI models.The researchers said they had demonstrated it can solve novel and difficult tasks without needing any special prompting, including in the fields of mathematics, vision, medicine, law and psychology.AMAZON PLANNING CONVERSATIONAL AI CHATBOT FOR WEBSITE SEARCH""Moreover, in all of these tasks, GPT-4’s performance is strikingly close to human-level performance, and often vastly surpasses prior models such as ChatGPT,"" they said. ""Given the breadth and depth of GPT-4’s capabilities, we believe that it could reasonably be viewed as an early (yet still incomplete) version of an artificial general intelligence (AGI) system.""READ ON THE FOX BUSINESS APPFor example, computer scientists asked it to solve a puzzle that should have required an understanding of the physical world.""Here we have a book, nine eggs, a laptop, a bottle and a nail,"" they prompted to GPT-4. ""Please tell me how to stack them onto each other in a stable manner.""GPT-4 instructed to: put the book on a flat surface, arrange the eggs and distribute them evenly in rows, leave space between them and make sure the eggs are not cracked, and place the laptop on top the eggs and the bottle on top of the laptop.""The bottle will add some height and balance to the stack, and its cylindrical shape will reduce the contact area with the laptop. Make sure the bottle is empty and closed, and do not shake or tilt it,"" GPT-4 noted, then advising to place the nail on top of the bottle cap, ""with the pointy end facing up and the flat end facing down.""""The nail will be the final and smallest object in the stack, and its sharp tip will prevent it from rolling or sliding off the bottle. Make sure the nail is clean and straight, and do not touch or move it,"" it said.The paper said it had shown ""sparks"" of artificial general intelligence, which is shorthand for a machine that can do anything the human brain can do.""I started off being very skeptical – and that evolved into a sense of frustration, annoyance, maybe even fear,"" Peter Lee, who leads research at Microsoft, told The New York Times on Tuesday. ""You think: Where the heck is this coming from?""While it was not necessarily the kind of fully-formed unicorn one might find in a children's book, GPT4 got the concept right.""This has been a long-standing challenge for AI research. This has always been the problem with all those, you know, AI systems that came before…"" Bubeck explained.""Here we are really facing something which is much more general and really feels like intelligence,"" Bubeck said in March, adding that he was worried about AI growth and that while GPT-4's intelligence is comparable to human intelligence, it is different.The Times pointed out that because researchers were testing an early version of GPT-4 that had not yet been fine-tuned, the claims made in the paper cannot be verified by outside experts. Microsoft said the system available to the public is not as powerful as the version they tested.OpenAI said it had passed a simulated bar exam, with a score around the top 10% of test takers, and that improvements had led to the ""best-ever results (though far from perfect) on factuality, steerability and refusing to go outside of guardrails.""CLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESSHowever, the San Francisco-based company acknowledged that GPT-4 still has limitations and warned users to be careful. It said it is ""still not fully reliable"" because it still ""hallucinates"" facts and makes reasoning errors. Bubeck discussed these hallucinations later in the podcast.""Great care should be taken when using language model outputs, particularly in high-stakes contexts, with the exact protocol (such as human review, grounding with additional context or avoiding high-stakes uses altogether) matching the needs of a specific use-case,"" OpenAI advised.The Associated Press contributed to this report.","May 16, 2023 at 1:19 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-researchers-gpt-4-shows-181938690.html,Fox Business,0.0,0.0,0.12789365516638243,0.5153012812103721,2023-05-16 13:19:00,2023-05-16 13:19:00,309.1541601521514,311.0599975585937,-1.9058374064422878

Yet since it unveiled its latest AI tools at a developer’s conference last week, the stock has advanced 12%, adding $160 billion in market value and erasing its underperformance against peers like Apple Inc. and Microsoft Corp.“Investors are questioning whether Alphabet is a winner or loser as AI changes the landscape,” said Jason Benowitz, senior portfolio manager at CI Roosevelt. “This puts them more solidly in the winner camp.”Alphabet continued its outperformance on Tuesday, rising 3.3% after 13F filings showed that Bill Ackman’s Pershing Square was among firms that bought the stock in the first quarter. Late on Monday, the hedge fund disclosed the purchase of more than 10 million of Alphabet’s Class A and Class C shares in the first quarter, worth about $1.2 billion at current prices.With excitement around AI building, Alphabet had largely missed out on the stellar gains seen by many of its tech peers, particularly as the rapid growth of OpenAI’s ChatGPT is seen as a potential threat to the dominance of its search business. So last week’s announcement of a more conversational search engine and that the company is making its AI-powered chatbot more broadly available provided a timely boost.Read more: Alphabet’s Search Dominance Feels Heat From ChatGPT: Tech WatchMorgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak was among Wall Street analysts heartened by Google’s presentation after what he called “AI overhang” in the stock.If the company can successfully integrate the new AI features to its products that serve hundreds of millions of people, it should “build further confidence in AI driven upside to come,” Nowak wrote in a research note after the event.Read more: AI Is Buzzword Separating Winners from Losers: Earnings WatchEven after such a strong rally, Alphabet isn’t expensive relative to peers. At around 19 times, the stock’s price-to-projected profit ratio is the highest in months, yet it’s still much cheaper than Microsoft and Apple, which are priced at 29 and 27 times, respectively.Of course, there are still plenty of skeptics. Loop Capital analyst Rob Sanderson says lingering concerns about AI risks will prevent Alphabet’s cheaper market valuation multiple from expanding. The analyst cut his rating on the stock to hold from buy on Monday, even though he sees the company as a major beneficiary of AI adoption in the long run.“We do not see this as an existential threat to Google, but this behavior will become a competitive force against its dominance in connecting users to information,” he wrote.Tech Chart of the DayAlphabet’s surge in the last week has propelled its relative strength index beyond the level of 70 that signals to some technical analysts that a stock may have risen too far, too quickly.

MSFT,Top 50 Richest Countries In The World By Net Worth,"National net wealth, also referred to as national net worth, represents the total value of a country's assets minus its liabilities. It encompasses the collective net wealth owned by the residents of a nation at a specific point in time. This measure is a crucial indicator of a country's capacity to take on debt, sustain expenditure, and is influenced by various factors including real estate and equity market prices, exchange rates, liabilities, population demographics, as well as the presence of human resources, natural resources, capital, and technological advancements.Websites that rely solely on GDP per capita or GNI (Gross National Income) as the variable to rank the richest countries in the world may oversimplify and misrepresent the true economic prosperity of a nation. While these metrics provide some insight into the average income or economic output per person, they fail to capture the complete picture of a country's wealth and well-being. GDP per capita or GNI does not account for the cost of living. A country with a high GDP per capita may still have a high cost of living, rendering the average person's purchasing power relatively low. Using these metrics without considering the cost of goods, services, and essential needs can distort the ranking of countries and mislead readers about the actual quality of life experienced by individuals. Moreover, relying solely on GDP per capita or GNI fails to capture non-monetary aspects that contribute to a nation's overall wealth and well-being. Factors such as access to quality education, healthcare, social support systems, infrastructure, and environmental sustainability are crucial indicators of a country's prosperity and should not be overlooked in evaluations of wealth. Although income and wealth are related, a high income in a given year does not necessarily mean that a country is wealthy. Accumulating wealth takes a longer period, often spanning years or even decades.Consider the example of retired individuals. Among our readership, we have thousands of retirees who do not generate an annual income exceeding $200,000. However, they have amassed substantial wealth by investing millions in stocks and bonds over the years. In terms of wealth, they are part of the top 1%, but their income alone may not place them within the top 1% bracket. This highlights the distinction between income and wealth, demonstrating that individuals can accumulate significant wealth over time, even if their annual income may not reflect their overall financial status.Our Methodology karsten-winegeart-BYPGE0ZYID8-unsplashTotal Wealth in 2021: $615 bnTotal Wealth in 2010: $331 bnPercentage Change: 85.8%Malaysia, located in Southeast Asia, is a federal constitutional monarchy comprising thirteen states and three federal territories.

Nvidia’s stock is up 98% so far this year, making it one of the top performers in the S&P 500 Index.“AI is very, very real and could be every bit as impactful as the internet,” Druckenmiller said at the 2023 Sohn Investment Conference last week.Duquesne Family Office added more than 208,000 shares of Nvidia during the first quarter, increasing the market value of the firm’s holding in the chipmaker to about $220 million.Tepper’s Appaloosa Management added a new position in Nvidia, buying 150,000 shares with a market value of about $41.7 million. The firm also bought 500,000 new shares of Cathie Wood’s ARK Innovation ETF, which invests in companies that create disruptive technologies.

MSFT,Bill Gates is full of regret about missed vacations and broken relationships in commencement speech: You are not a slacker if you cut yourself some sl...,"“When I was your age, I didn’t believe in vacations,” Gates notes, in remarks posted to his blog, Gates notes. He told the crowd that when he was 22 years old, he thought he would be working at Microsoft forever. “I didn’t believe in weekends. I pushed everyone around me to work very long hours. In the early days of Microsoft, my office overlooked the parking lot—and I would keep track of who was leaving early and staying late.” Looking at it now, he encouraged the new graduates to learn from his mistakes. “Take a break when you need to. Take it easy on the people around you when they need it, too.”As Gates told it, slacking might mean taking more time to look back and cherish one’s own success, bounce back from difficulties, and develop relationships, all seemingly difficult to do while patrolling a software company's employees’ cars going and coming. He cautions the foresters to not “wait as long as I did to learn this lesson.” After noting that new graduates survived many Tequila Sunrises, he encouraged them to do what he didn’t and “take a moment and have some fun.”They might as well unwind given that Gates has some high expectations for their cohort, noting that he believes the Class of 2023 will “be the ones to solve the climate crisis and reduce the gap between the rich and poor.” Hopefully, they’ll get to relax too along the way.","May 15, 2023 at 4:30 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bill-gates-full-regret-missed-213034209.html,Fortune,-0.025000000000000022,0.47500000000000003,0.10064574314574315,0.4685678210678211,2023-05-15 16:30:00,2023-05-15 16:30:00,308.42577302114216,308.78497314453125,-0.3592001233890869

In fact, back in February, C3.AI saw shares surge 100% over the span of the month, which is when investors really started to hear more about OpenAI's ChatGPT.Now, today's stock boost does come after some turbulent times for the company. Earlier last month, we had a short seller letter alleging that C3.AI was involved in, quote, ""aggressive accounting to inflate its income statement."" The company did respond with a statement of its own, writing that the letter appears to be a highly creative and transparent attempt by a self-proclaimed short seller to short the stock, publish an inflammatory letter to move the stock price downward, then cover the short and pocket the profits.Year to date, C3.AI is up roughly 100%. But while that stock is up, SoFi Technologies is down. That's another stock I'm watching this afternoon, the stock off about 4 and 1/2 percent, a little less than that, on the heels of a Wall Street downgrade. Wedbush analyst downgrading the stock to underperform from neutral, also slashing their price target to $2.50 a share, down from the prior $5 a share.In a note released today, the analyst said the financial services company could be, quote, ""nearing a tipping point on the fee income it recognizes from loan applications and sales,"" warning the fee income could decline significantly. Wedbush added it thinks that SoFi's capital levels may be overstated using fair value accounting and that they don't believe SoFi will change their accounting methods in the near term.On top of those headwinds, the analyst said they think the company may look to raise capital this year to support growth. So Wall Street just continuing to remain a bit skeptical about this stock, with shares under pressure throughout the entire day. Although they have recovered from their lows earlier this morning.Now, of course, the story, it's far from over, considering the UK rejected the same plan last month. And then over here in the US, the Federal Trade Commission is continuing to evaluate the deal. Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley and Alexis Keenan have a full explainer up on the website right now. They really dive into the nuances surrounding this potential deal.

GOOG,Why Montana's TikTok ban faces massive challenges,"Montana on Wednesday became the first state in the country to ban TikTok. But experts say you shouldn’t expect the measure to survive challenges in the courts.“The ban is a dramatic and unconstitutional incursion on the First Amendment rights of Montanans,” Ramya Krishnan, staff attorney at the Knight First Amendment Institute and a lecturer in law at Columbia Law School, told Yahoo Finance. “To justify the ban, Montana would have to show that it's necessary to prevent actual harms. And it hasn't done this.”In a statement after signing the bill, Gov. Greg Gianforte said the Chinese Communist Party is using TikTok to “spy on Americans, violate their privacy, and collect personal, private, and sensitive information.”The broader problem for Montana’s law, experts say, is that it’s simply too broad.“The legal hurdle is the First Amendment,” David Greene, civil liberties director and senior staff attorney for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, explained via email. “This law, as a restriction on the way Montanans speak and receive speech, will need to be justified by the state as an appropriately narrow and effective way of protecting Montanans’ personal data. That will be very difficult to do.”The US has long accused TikTok of collecting data on Americans and feeding it to the Chinese government. Reasons include, potentially, building a database on American users, storing data to blackmail citizens, or trying to spread disinformation online.The main fear is that China can use its national intelligence law to force TikTok parent company ByteDance to turn over any data on American users to the Chinese government. TikTok, however, has said it has never shared information with the Chinese government.Neither the US government nor Montana has provided concrete evidence that China is siphoning American user data from TikTok. And that’s a major problem for the new law. “Speculative harms can't justify a total ban on a communications platform, let alone one that is used by...Americans in the state of Montana,” said Krishnan.Even enforcing the ban could prove problematic for Montana. If the state chooses to determine residents’ locations based on their internet protocol addresses, they could accidentally block citizens of bordering states from downloading TikTok, as well. Montanans could also use virtual private networks to mask their location and download the app anyway.Rather than outright banning TikTok, experts say the best way to address concerns that the company is harvesting Americans’ data is through a national data privacy law. Congress has discussed the topic for years without passing any legislation.“First look at passing a federal privacy law…to ensure that there are specific limits and rules for the road of how any online service, TikTok included, can collect and use and share people's personal information,” Emma Llansó, director of the Center for Democracy and Technology's Free Expression Project told Yahoo Finance.“That would be an enormous step forward for people's privacy, and would not require banning any apps whatsoever.”According to Llansó, the government could also put restrictions on how data brokers in the US share Americans’ information.“They could put limits on that or put a stop to that, and that would be a much more meaningful way to protect the safety and security of people's data from foreign government surveillance,” she explained.Regardless, we won’t have to wait long to find out how Montana’s ban will fare in the courts. According to Reuters, a group of five Montana TikTok users are already suing the state to block the ban.The clock is ticking.Find live stock market quotes and the latest business and finance news","May 19, 2023 at 1:28 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-montanas-tiktok-ban-faces-massive-challenges-182836790.html,Yahoo Finance,0.0,1.0,0.0990447957839262,0.40813452851496335,2023-05-19 13:28:00,2023-05-19 13:28:00,124.1999969482422,123.25,0.9499969482422017
GOOG,Could Montana's TikTok ban violate free speech rights?,"Yahoo Finance tech editor Dan Howley breaks down Montana's TikTok ban, if the ban violates free speech rights, and the technical challenges related to the ban.Excuse me. Experts that I spoke to basically said that blocking the app entirely would violate Montanans' First Amendment rights to free speech. And essentially, they say that that's because they're seeking a broad means without trying to first go ahead and provide a narrower means of attacking this problem that they say exists, the idea that China is siphoning American user data from TikTok.Now, the experts that I spoke to said that a more clear response than just banning TikTok outright would be to set up some kind of national privacy data legislation. So that's something that would be narrower. It wouldn't include banning an app that 150 million Americans use. And it would still allow Google and Apple to provide the app. It would just limit the means for apps, including TikTok rivals like Meta and Twitter, from collecting user data.Now, that's the First Amendment side of things. Then there's the technical side of things. Basically, this is something that banning an app in an entire state, but a specific state is difficult to do. Now, they could say, OK, your IP address, your internet protocol address, which is basically your address for when you're online telling where you are, could be used as a means for kind of geolocation or your GPS signal. But the problem is that if you are near the border, for instance, of Montana, other states, residents in other states, could be impacted. So they wouldn't be able to download TikTok as well.The other issue is people could just set up a VPN and then say that they're in-- I don't know-- Venezuela and download TikTok within Montana. So there's no surefire way of this actually seeming to work. The other problem is Apple and Google would be on the hook. It would be $10,000 per violation. So any time a person downloads TikTok, once this goes into effect, Apple and Google would have to pay $10,000, and then an additional $10,000 for each day the violation continues. So they could rack up millions of dollars in fines here because of the app itself.Now, overall, it doesn't seem like this is going to hold water under scrutiny. There's already a lawsuit being filed by some residents in Montana who are seeking to nullify this law. It really does seem as though it's going to be something that falls to the wayside rather quickly if it's challenged in courts. At least, that's according to these First Amendment experts that I spoke to.","May 19, 2023 at 10:55 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/could-montanas-tiktok-ban-violate-155524652.html,Yahoo Finance Video,0.4,0.8,0.11637205387205389,0.41569865319865323,2023-05-19 10:55:00,2023-05-19 10:55:00,124.1999969482422,123.25,0.9499969482422017

GOOG,Social media firms score Supreme Court win in case that could have changed the web,"Internet platforms notched a major Supreme Court victory Thursday when the high court's justices unanimously decided a case that could have rewritten the rules of the web. The court also sent a parallel case back to a lower court.Both cases had to do with whether social media companies could be held liable for hosting and promoting terrorist content on their platforms. In deciding they could not, the court left a 27-year old law intact.Although the attack that prompted the suit was terrible and tragic, Diakun said, imposing liability on the platforms in these circumstances would have had far-reaching implications for free speech online. Still, Diakun said she expects the court will eventually be pressed to answer important questions that it avoided in today’s opinions.""Questions about the scope of platforms’ immunity under Section 230 are consequential and will certainly come up soon in other cases,"" she said.“Critics of Section 230, as well as Justice Thomas in dissents and concurrences, had said [the court] should look at Section 230 in the appropriate case,” Berkowitz said. “Given those concerns I think today’s decision is very positive.”The claims in the two cases arose from separate ISIS terrorist attacks and were brought by victims of the attacks.In their arguments, plaintiffs claimed that YouTube's act of creating thumbnails — images that appear in internet search results as representations of available third-party content — converted the company from a passive host of third-party content into a recommender of content, more akin to publishers or speakers that are not covered by Section 230's liability shield.Find live stock market quotes and the latest business and finance news","May 18, 2023 at 1:03 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/social-media-firms-score-supreme-court-win-in-case-that-could-have-changed-the-web-180314103.html,Yahoo Finance,0.4166666666666667,0.23333333333333334,0.08634686147186148,0.4906093073593074,2023-05-18 13:03:00,2023-05-18 13:03:00,121.55999755859376,123.5199966430664,-1.959999084472642

GOOG,"Senators say they failed to act on social media, won't make same mistake with AI","Wednesday, May 17, 2023If the senators gathered for the Senate Judiciary Committee’s hearing on AI on Tuesday seem to agree on one thing, it’s that they don’t want to miss the opportunity to regulate AI like they did social media.The gist of the legislators’ warnings came down to the potential for AI being used to influence consumers, generate disinformation, or reinforce bias.“We had the same choice when we faced social media. We failed to seize that moment,” Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) said. “Now we have the obligation to do it on AI before the threats and risks become real.”During the hearing, Altman, Montgomery, and Marcus each told the gathered senators that Congress should put at least some kind legislation into place to govern the use of AI. Altman and Marcus in particular called for a new regulatory body that could provide the appropriate licenses for companies to deploy different types of AI.Without those, the witnesses said, AI could present its own unique set of problems.“Fundamentally, these new systems are going to be destabilizing,” Marcus said in his opening testimony. “They can and will create persuasive lies at a scale humanity's never seen before. Outsiders will use them to affect our elections. Insiders to manipulate our markets and our political systems. Democracy itself is threatened.”Altman, for his part, said he has his own set of fears about AI. “I think if this technology goes wrong, it could go quite wrong,” he said. “And we want to be vocal about that. We want to work with the government to prevent that from happening.”Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), meanwhile, questioned whether AI could be used to influence public opinion.For years members of Congress have called for stricter regulations over social media content.There’s a handful of reasons social media has avoided regulations, including a lack of consensus on just how to do it. Section 230, which serves as the backbone of the modern internet, is a frequent target of both Democrats and Republicans. But neither side can agree on why.Democrats say they want to hold sites accountable for what their users post, especially when it comes to disinformation, while Republicans say they want to go after sites for over-moderating content.Privacy regulation, meanwhile, has been in the works for years, but here we are in 2023 and there’s no true national data privacy law.While Congress hasn’t been able to pull anything together with regards to social media or privacy, it looks as though there might be hope for AI regulation.Still, it’ll likely be some time before any kind of regulation sees the light of day. Blumenthal himself said that Tuesday’s hearing was the first of a number to come. But with the pace at which AI is advancing, that could be too long for Congress to wait.Click here for the latest technology business news, reviews, and useful articles on tech and gadgetsRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance","May 17, 2023 at 2:52 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/senators-say-they-failed-to-act-on-social-media-wont-make-same-mistake-with-ai-195217014.html,Yahoo Finance,-0.15555555555555556,0.1638888888888889,0.11924371924371925,0.48627298627298615,2023-05-17 14:52:00,2023-05-17 14:52:00,120.18000030517578,121.4800033569336,-1.3000030517578125

GOOG,AI speculators need to 'differentiate between actual spending and investment' and hype: Strategist,"Tematica Research CIO Chris Versace and J.P. Morgan Asset Management Global Market Strategist Meera Pandit discuss how the proliferation of AI speculation has impacted markets at large.And what bothers me a little bit about it is how companies like PepsiCo, Wendy's, and others are starting to talk about how they will be using AI and how that's going to really change their business. And then all of a sudden, I flash back to 1999, 2000 in the dot-com era when all sorts of companies were like, well, we're no longer X company. We're x.com company. And it's almost like I got to be in the game. I got to say something.The other thing I'd say is I think with a lot of these technologies, they actually require more workers up front even if eventually they will save on the labor force. So if we think about the worker's position, the shortage of workers we have, the very specific training that might be required, I think there are some headwinds when we think about the supply of workers and companies' ability to put capital in the near term.Now, I think long term, to your point, this is a huge theme that will play out over many years. But we might need to be a little bit patient. Think about, again, some of the ancillary technology required, the inputs required over a longer period of time that can fuel this theme. But I think that the huge run-up in markets solely around AI enthusiasm might be a little bit beyond its skis.CHRIS VERSACE: Thank you.","May 17, 2023 at 8:52 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/ai-speculators-differentiate-between-actual-135207681.html,Yahoo Finance Video,0.0,0.1,0.05347222222222223,0.38541666666666674,2023-05-17 08:52:00,2023-05-17 08:52:00,120.18000030517578,121.4800033569336,-1.3000030517578125

GOOG,OpenAI CEO calls on government to regulate AI,"OpenAI CEO Sam Altman testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday, calling on Congress to pass legislation to regulate the development of AI at a time when the technology is gaining traction across the tech industry and beyond.“We think that regulatory intervention by governments will be critical to mitigate the risks of increasingly powerful models,” Altman said in his opening remarks.“For example, the US government might consider a combination of licensing and testing requirements for development and release of AI models above a threshold of capabilities.”Both IBM Chief Privacy and Trust Officer Christina Montgomery and NYU Professor Gary Marcus, who also testified during the hearing, similarly called for regulating AI and making the technology more transparent so that users know when they are interacting with AI.During the hearing, Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) illustrated the power of generative AI by using a version of ChatGPT trained on his prior floor speeches and a type of AI voice cloning software to read a completely made up opening statement that sounded like something Blumenthal might have said on his own.“If you were listening from home, you might have thought that voice was mine and the words from me, but in fact, that voice was not mine. The words were not mine,” Blumenthal explained.Senators raised several questions throughout the hearing about the potential for AI to be used to manipulate elections or cause other real-world harms.“Is it going to be like the printing press? That diffused knowledge and power and learning widely across the landscape that empowered ordinary everyday individuals that lead to greater flourishing, that lead above all to greater liberty?” Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) asked.“Or is it going to be more like the atom bomb? Huge technological breakthrough, but the consequences severe, terrible, continue to haunt us to this day?”Altman, meanwhile, said that he sees the technology as a “printing press moment.” But when pressed about the potential for misuse, the CEO said he is looking toward the government for help.“My worst fears are that we, the field, the technology, the industry, cause significant harm to the world,” Altman said. “I think if this technology goes wrong, it could go quite wrong. And we want to be vocal about that. We want to work with the government to prevent that from happening.”Both Altman and Marcus called on senators to create a new regulatory body that can monitor AI companies and provide licenses to deploy AI models.Sen. Lindsay Graham (R-S.C.) equated the idea to how energy companies need licenses to build nuclear power plants.While the roughly three-hour hearing saw plenty of questions from senators, there was little in the way of concrete next steps.And as senators and witnesses pointed out repeatedly, the technology will continue to advance regardless of whether regulations are put in place or not.Click here for the latest technology business news, reviews, and useful articles on tech and gadgetsRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance","May 16, 2023 at 1:32 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/openai-ceo-calls-on-government-to-regulate-ai-183229884.html,Yahoo Finance,0.0,0.0,0.04114304812834225,0.5501336898395721,2023-05-16 13:32:00,2023-05-16 13:32:00,116.83000183105467,120.08999633789062,-3.2599945068359517

Taking a look at Microsoft and Google, fractional losses there. But some gains, Amazon, that's up by about 1.3%. Of course, a company that's already reported. But for the e-commerce giant, we will see how that continues to move around based on what other retailers have to say over the course of this week and what they're hearing from customers.Also zeroing in on Meta. If you've been tracking this one over the course of this year, year-to-date, it's been quite the bounce back. Last year, took an L. This year, they bounce back, maybe. We'll see how things continue to roll out. But year-to-date, it's up by about 97%. So just zeroing in on that for a hot second at the opening cross for many of our folks who might be following that one at home.","May 15, 2023 at 8:56 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/stock-markets-sectors-open-higher-135656383.html,Yahoo Finance Video,0.125,0.5,0.05137022938747076,0.36090585659551166,2023-05-15 08:56:00,2023-05-15 08:56:00,116.48999786376952,116.95999908447266,-0.4700012207031392

GOOG,Google Workspace VP: 'Losing the trust of the user is the ultimate point of no return',"One of the major announcements during the show included the addition of a generative AI feature called Help Me Write, which will, well, help you write emails. But because it uses generative AI, Google Workspace VP Aparna Pappu says the company needs to take care that it doesn’t push out inappropriate responses or the company risks losing users’ trust.“Losing the trust of the user is the ultimate point of no return,” she told Yahoo Finance. “That's our Northstar, ‘Cannot lose user trust.’ ”Generative AI has raised a slew of thorny questions ranging from whether it will make jobs, like yours truly’s, obsolete to whether it should be allowed in schools. How much users can trust the technology to produce accurate responses to their prompts has also become a point of contention.Pappu says that’s also part of the reason Google is only rolling out its generative AI features to trusted testers before going public.“Before we get into [general availability] we have you got to test it and put it through the wringer even to get it to Labs [Google’s early user test program] it goes through so much rigorous usage testing, and responsibility testing, safety testing before we even let a single external user try it,” Pappu explained.Both Google and Microsoft’s generative AI offerings specifically state that they’re in early testing phases or that some answers may not be accurate. Moreover, generative AI in general is prone to “hallucinate,” which is basically an elaborate way of saying it can make up responses to some user queries that seem accurate, but are wrong.To that end, Pappu says Google continues to test its systems as a means of trying to prevent false answers or inappropriate responses.“Responsible and safe AI, it does not get born overnight. It is years of working on AI and knowing how to do adversarial testing,” Pappu explained. “So there's fundamentally responsible, safe AI baked into how we build these products.”One problem that Pappu says is unique to Workspace is that it’s used by billions of users, each with their own understanding of technology. Introducing a feature like generative AI to the equation without confusing those users is a conundrum all its own.“We have 3 billion users,” she said. “We have a responsibility to make these things really simple and easy to use.”Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance","May 12, 2023 at 8:35 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/google-workspace-vp-losing-the-trust-of-the-user-is-the-ultimate-point-of-no-return-133510248.html,Yahoo Finance,0.0,1.0,0.20331349206349209,0.5623809523809524,2023-05-12 08:35:00,2023-05-12 08:35:00,117.0,117.91999816894533,-0.9199981689453267

GOOG,Everyone is getting the AI 'revolution' wrong: Morning Brief,"This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can receive in your inbox every Monday to Friday by 6:30 a.m. ET along with:The chart of the dayWhat we're watchingWhat we're readingEconomic data releases and earningsTwo letters are on the tip of every business executive's tongue these days: AI.And even with a seemingly endless discussion of artificial intelligence and its potential application across industries, the level of conversation happening about AI is not right.Either we're talking about it way too much or way too little.Today's middle ground on ""everyone has a strategy"" will either be a strange footnote for this business cycle or a gross underestimation of the technology's true power. There is no in between.Talking about AI at ""Sundar Pichai I/O presentation"" levels, it seems, is good by investors.But, of course, Iger's charming retort was followed by a serious answer.Because no serious executive at this point doesn't have a response to questions about what a company's AI strategy might be.""It's pretty clear that AI developments represent some pretty interesting opportunities for us and some substantial benefits,"" Iger added. ""In fact, we're already starting to use AI to create some efficiencies and ultimately to better serve consumers. Getting closer to the customer is something that is a real goal of ours. And we think that AI will provide some great opportunities to do that.""For companies like Disney with huge libraries of intellectual property that could potentially be spoofed by new technologies, Iger added, ""our legal team is working overtime already to try to come to grips with what could be some of the challenges here.""Overall, Iger said he's ""bullish"" on the prospects for bringing AI into Disney's business.Which, of course. The technical marvel of ""Fantasia"" has already been rendered routine by technological advances; AI might make a film like this from something you could sketch out by lunch.Neils Bohr once said that predictions are hard to make, especially those about the future.But if we're indeed on the cusp of an electricity-level shift in our relationship with a certain technology then no one in business, the media, education, government, or any other institution should feel self-conscious about continually evangelizing on the power of AI. One day, that evangelism will merely be table stakes.Should AI appear more like the recent hype about ""blockchain technology"" that fizzled with the 2018-19 crypto winter, however, then today's AI discourse will be remembered largely for what it's been so far — a little annoying, a little insistent, and a bit too pat to seem like the real thing.Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance","May 12, 2023 at 8:00 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/everyone-is-getting-the-ai-revolution-wrong-morning-brief-130037420.html,Yahoo Finance,-0.25,0.6166666666666667,0.1086727666273121,0.5402548209366391,2023-05-12 08:00:00,2023-05-12 08:00:00,117.0,117.91999816894533,-0.9199981689453267

I was just at the Goldman Sachs Industrial Conference yesterday, and it was a topic of almost every single fireside chat, every single interview I had there.

GOOG,"Google is firing back at Microsoft, and investors seem to be loving it","The moves are meant to prove that Google, which helped pioneer the technology behind Microsoft partner OpenAI’s ChatGPT, can match and exceed the Windows maker’s offerings in the nascent generative AI space.And Wall Street seems to be taking note. Shares of Google’s parent Alphabet were up more than 5% in afternoon trading. Shares of Microsoft, meanwhile, were roughly flat.Microsoft has been leading the AI conversation since it debuted its Bing chatbot in February. Google tried to preempt Microsoft’s announcement by revealing Bard a day before Microsoft showed off Bing to the press. But without a live demonstration, Google quickly found itself playing catch up.But on Wednesday, the company debuted a variety of new products meant to brush aside Microsoft’s threat to Google’s dominance.The biggest announcement came by way of what Google calls its Search Generative Experience. The platform is a kind of reimagining of Google Search that uses generative AI to provide more expansive, conversational answers to your queries.Type “Good bike for a 5-mile commute with hills,” and you’ll receive a series of tips on what to look for when buying a bike for commuting, as well as a list of ads for bikes with explanations about each of them.From there you can ask follow-up questions about e-bikes, and eventually end up with the bike you might want to buy. If it looks like a familiar experience, it’s because it’s a similar layout to Microsoft’s Bing search engine.Google’s Bard, meanwhile, is the company’s answer to Microsoft’s Bing chat bot. Both provide conversational answers to your queries and can provide follow up responses. Bard is also getting what’s called multimodal support, meaning you’ll be able to get answers as both text and images. Microsoft is working on the same thing for Bing.Then there were Google's new generative AI features for Android phones. The company says it's Magic Compose, which will be available later this year, will let users change the style of their text in the Messages app. So if you ask someone to dinner, you can adjust the setting to ""Chill,"" ""Excited,"" or ""Lyrical"" and Magic Compose will alert your text to match.Google also announced a new option for Android phones that will let you use generative AI to create new wallpapers.Both companies are racing to become the leaders in generative AI at a point when the technology is still new to consumers. The boom in the area kicked off when OpenAI released its ChatGPT in November 2022. The platform quickly became one of the most popular apps on the internet, and sent companies into overdrive searching for a means to add similar features to their products.For Google and Microsoft, the key is ensuring that generative AI helps drive user engagement that they can translate to advertising sales. But both companies need to tread carefully. Generative AI is prone to making up responses that sound shockingly true.Those kinds of errors could impact user trust, hurting both the companies and any reason consumers have for using their products.The race is on.Correction: A prior version of this article misstated the release date for Google's generative AI wallpaper.

GOOG,Google Pixel Fold has its own 'short-term challenges' amid low demand for foldable phones: Analyst,"IDC Mobile Device Tracker Program Vice President Ryan Reith joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss the new Google Pixel Fold, including demand, challenges, pricing, and potential competition from Apple in the market.Joining us now to discuss is Ryan Reith, the program vice president for IDC's mobile device tracker suite. Good to have you on the show, Ryan. So first want to really get some background here starting with Google's phone here. So this Pixel fold, $1,799 here. Tell me, why do we need this? Why is Google even entering this space right now?And the rest of the industry, putting Apple aside-- certainly the rest of the phone industry in the Android space has already gone into this foldable form factor, so it's sort of follow the leader. And you know-- anyways, that's really what it is. We're not seeing the demand for these products just yet. I'm not completely pessimistic on the category in the long run. But I think it certainly has its short-term challenges.So what's driving Google around this? I don't quite know other than maybe the ability to get their software developers that follow Android to develop for this variation of a foldable ecosystem, which it does need variations of the application. So there is something there.To answer your question, the consumer, what's going to drive them to buy this, I don't see anything until the use case really shows up. And I think right now what we've seen-- the buyers globally on this have been what we would consider early adopters, not what's going to drive the needle. So it's really going to need a proven use case.And like I said, maybe Google is using this hardware as a way to get their developers to develop on that, and then ultimately it could help other Android OEMs. But it's kind of a-- you know, it's always a chicken and egg with them because you never quite understand which side is really about driving the Android ecosystem versus the Google hardware ecosystem.They've also, by media sort of headlines, continued to delay their AR or VR headset. And to me, I think hopefully the industry knows this. They have had and they've been testing the capabilities on everything, including foldable phones, for a while. I think that they wait till the pulse on the industry and from a demand standpoint is right, and I don't think it's right-- right now.And from a volume standpoint, the market almost doubled last year alone. Went from 8 million units in '21 to about 14 million last year. And we assume it's going to be somewhere around 21, 22 million units this year. So yeah, from a growth standpoint, it's growing. It's coming from a zero base. And keep in mind we're talking about a market size that's 1.2 billion, so we're talking about a percentage point.We're also talking about a time where the economy is not good, people are not willing to spend more, and it's not proven use case. So again, it's a really tough ask right now to get people to spend more on something that they don't quite know yet that they need it. Again, I'm not completely pessimistic. In the long-term I think that use cases can be proven around foldable displays. I don't think that they're there yet.","May 11, 2023 at 11:02 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/google-pixel-fold-own-short-160221350.html,Yahoo Finance Video,0.3,0.65,0.09193771693771695,0.48004563004563,2023-05-11 11:02:00,2023-05-11 11:02:00,115.86000061035156,116.9000015258789,-1.0400009155273438
GOOG,Google unveils new AI features to compete with Microsoft,"Yahoo Finance tech editor Dan Howley reports from the Google I/O 2023 Conference to discuss Google launching a new AI-driven search in response to Microsoft's new AI developments.[AUDIO LOGO]And so Google's been kind of searching to catch up with that on its own. And it did just that yesterday. It announced a slew of new features for its search engine, including generative AI capabilities. And it announced that a chatbot Bard is going to be available publicly. And so people will be able to jump on that.Now, the search part of things will work like this. You'll be able to do your standard search, but use a basic conversation structure. Type in a sentence. One of the examples they gave was, why do whales sing? And so from there, you'll see, using this experimental AI version, a list of reasons why whales might sing-- communication, looking for prey, things along those lines.Below that, you'll see images of whales. And then they'll perhaps give you an idea of where you can go see whales, do whale-watching tours. So part of this is giving you the generative AI aspect, but also a signal to advertisers that, hey, we're not leaving this behind. This is still our bread and butter of our business. We're just including it in a different way.Outside of that, they also discussed some of the ways they're bringing generative AI to their workspace. Now, that's basically their Microsoft Office equivalent, or Microsoft 365 is what they call that now. But I digress. It's their productivity suite. And so they're adding new capabilities where you'll have a thing called Help Me Write in Gmail. You'll also have that in Google Docs. And it'll, I mean, basically help you write whatever you're trying to write, whether that's a cover letter, whether that's an email response.And Microsoft, meanwhile, has introduced similar features on its own. So we're seeing this kind of tit for tat back and forth between the two companies to see who is going to be the big AI leader. And Google has decades of experience here. Microsoft partnering with OpenAI. It's not as though Microsoft's AI is too shabby on its own either. But this is going to be a continuing conversation. For now, Google seeming like it's getting back on equal footing after falling behind.","May 11, 2023 at 10:57 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/google-unveils-ai-features-compete-155712516.html,Yahoo Finance Video,0.13636363636363635,0.45454545454545453,0.15731818181818183,0.4918939393939394,2023-05-11 10:57:00,2023-05-11 10:57:00,115.86000061035156,116.9000015258789,-1.0400009155273438
GOOG,"Google unveils new AI features for Gmail, search at annual I/O Conference","Yahoo Finance tech editor Dan Howley reports live from the Google I/O 2023 Conference detailing the company's future plans for AI integration into features for Gmail.[AUDIO LOGO]But for Gmail specifically, it will allow you to basically have a prompt and then help write an email. And one of the examples that CEO Sundar Pichai had pointed to was if you had missed your flight, and you're trying to get a return on that ticket. So you would go and write out, I missed my flight, I need this-- I want to get my money back, or I'm not going to take this flight, I want my money back, and you would help-- press the Help Me Write button. And it would then create this long flowing text message.You can then elaborate on that. You can hit Elaborate, and it'll make it even more elaborate, as you can imagine. So basically putting together an entire new email for you that you otherwise might not have wanted to write or might not have been able to phrase the right way.There was also the announcement that they're adding generative AI to search. Now, this is still very early. It's in the testing phase. So they're only allowing trusted users to get access to it at this point, if that. And what it'll do is essentially kind of [INAUDIBLE] Microsoft's Bing where you will get a search result, say-- they did an example of a bike that's good for a commute with hills.And so it'll give you tips on what you need when commuting over hills with a bike. Then it'll give you a list of potential bikes that you might want to buy. Then you can go into a more conversational type of search with that generative AI bot and get more answers to more questions that you may have. All along the way, by the way, Google emphasizing that ads will still be a part of the process. That's basically just giving a little nudge to advertisers, saying, hey, our business is still our business.And then finally, we also saw that they're bringing Bard to all users. And so they're going to be rolling that out across the board. It's still going to be in the testing phase. So it's not a final product yet. But you will be able to have conversations with that AI agent. And so you'll be able to ask it some conversational questions, get conversational responses, and so on and so forth. So really, those are the three pillars that we saw rolling out at I/O, in addition to that cool folding phone they have.","May 11, 2023 at 9:54 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/google-unveils-ai-features-gmail-145410465.html,Yahoo Finance Video,0.13636363636363635,0.45454545454545453,0.2607479128014842,0.5984021335807049,2023-05-11 09:54:00,2023-05-11 09:54:00,115.86000061035156,116.9000015258789,-1.0400009155273438

That's better known in restaurant land as ""upselling"" a customer.The technology will also go a long way to improving food quality at Wendy's and drive-thru times, which may prove to be welcome news to hungry, hurried fast-food diners.""Now we're really thinking about how do we take some of the friction and make the experience even more seamless at our restaurants,"" Penegor explained of the initiative.

Get them positioned to make hot and juicy hamburgers fast and accurate every time? That's what we're trying to do.""Wendy's will probably look to automate more of its drive-thrus to keep pace with technological changes in generative AI and an evolution in how diners are interacting with the Frosty King.Penegor is bullish on the potential, of course. He said the company is thinking through how to make a smarter digital menu board, connect it to Wendy's loyalty program, create more personalized menus, and get consumers to trade up their purchases.""Those are all opportunities,"" Penegor explained. ""A little further off, obviously, but you got to start laying the pipework in the platforms today to really bring all of that to life.""For Wendy's, its AI initiatives add another good story to tell investors after a mixed year of performance in 2022.Customer count grew each month of the quarter.

GOOG,This Is Beyond Anything Ive Seen: Mark Cuban Says Hes Amazed by the Potential Impact of AI Here Are 2 Stocks That Wall Street Likes,"With the rise of ChatGPT, AI (artificial intelligence) has been generating an enormous amount of buzz this year, based on the tech’s potential to impact so many facets of everyday life and the way we interact with the world around us.But is it really a seismic development or just overhyped tech? Billionaire entrepreneur Mark Cuban falls resolutely in the former camp. Having recently waded in on the conversation, Cuban has said the tech’s potential is “beyond anything I’ve ever seen,” comparing ChatGPT to HTML and the early days of the internet.Cuban’s advice to companies is simple: get in on the AI game or risk becoming a dinosaur. “There are two kinds of companies in the world, Those who are great at AI, and everyone else,” Cuban opined.Given its investment in ChatGPT, Microsoft is considered to have gotten a head start in the AI arms race, but Alphabet is not about to throw the towel in. Google’s parent company has its fingers in many pies – from the core search engine business to YouTube to the Android operating system and self-driving car firm Waymo – but has also made significant investments in AI over the years.Recent headlines have been about its ChatGPT retort, its chatbot Bart, but you can trace the beginning of the company’s serious AI journey to the 2015 acquisition of AI research company DeepMind. Alphabet has invested in several other AI startups and companies, while it also operates an AI research lab called Google AI, which is focused on developing new AI technologies. More recently, the firm’s late-stage venture capital arm, CapitalG led a $100 million investment in corporate data company AlphaSense.And this week, the company’s Google I/O 2023 developer event took place, where the company announced new AI-powered features for its products and services, such as Google Search and Android and launched new hardware products, such as the Pixel Fold foldable smartphone and a Pixel tablet.If investors were previously concerned about Alphabet losing ground to Microsoft, following the event, Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak puts those fears to rest.“Google I/O showcased GOOGL’s strong long term AI competitive position across search, the developer community and productivity apps,” the analyst said. “AI is reshaping all of GOOGL’s products faster than expected as many of its newly announced AI features/products are rolling out over the coming weeks and months. Its speed of innovation and go-to-market motion are improving, which should make investors feel more comfortable about GOOGL’s long term positioning despite recent competitive concerns. Successful integration of these new AI features into Google’s 6 products that serve over 2bn users, and 15 products that serve more than 500mn users should build further confidence in AI driven upside to come.”The AI opportunities are not the preserve of only Big Tech. Smaller companies are in the game too, ones such as Five9, a leading CCaaS (Contact Center as a Service) company. Five9 provides cloud-based contact center software to businesses with the software designed to help organizations improve customer experience and increase productivity while reducing costs. The offerings include omnichannel routing, IVR (interactive voice response), speech recognition, workforce management, and reporting and analytics.Five9 uses AI and machine learning tech to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of its contact center software and the AI capabilities are integrated into various features of their platform, including automated chatbots, speech recognition for customer self-service and predictive analytics.Going by the recent Q1 report, the business is in good health. Revenue climbed by 19.5% year-over-year to $218.4 million, beating the Street’s forecast by $10.42 million. Adj. EPS of $0.41 also trumped the $0.24 expected by the analysts. For the full year 2023, the company sees revenue hitting the range between $906.0 to $909.0 million, some distance above consensus at $902.61 million.Despite the strong results, Five9 shares have been on the backfoot this year, and that is partly down to fears that the rise of AI could actually make services like the ones Five9 offers redundant.Au contraire, says Piper Sandler analyst James Fish, who highlights the positive noises made by the company on the matter.“While bears point to ChatGPT/ LLM technology as a headwind to the space, management confirms our AI thesis, noting adoption of AI is both accretive to revenue and the CCaaS TAM overall,” Fish wrote. “AI is acting as the main catalyst behind most of Five9’s large wins. New logo resilience remains with Five9’s pipeline hitting new highs and up 2x Y/Y, with further forward stability coming from a meaningful acceleration in long-term RPO, and management looking to continue to hire across the organization to support the pipeline.”“We believe these recent pullbacks provide opportunities for shareholders to buy into this strategic space that is an AI beneficiary, with a favorable competitive landscape, conservative 2023 guide, & large-deal catalysts on the horizon,” Fish went on to add.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed in this article are solely those of the featured analysts.

GOOG,Google unveils latest Bard AI features at annual I/O Conference,"Yahoo Finance tech editor Dan Howley reports from the Google I/O 2023 Conference, discussing comments made by Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai on the company's plans to integrate AI into future services.[AUDIO LOGO]They're not leaving behind businesses. They're going to continue to focus on those. And they're talking about AI safety. So just to kick things off, I mean, they really went in on how they're going to be bringing AI, generative AI to search. This is something that they've been telegraphing, something that Microsoft already does.They've already integrated generative AI into their Bing search product. And that is where Google started to look like it was falling behind, so a big announcement here with that. Though it's important to note, this is still a test. You're going to have to try to get in on a wait list.So it's not as though you're going to able to use it right away. They also discussed more about their Bard chatbot. They are going to allow everyone to start using that now. It's available in multiple languages. And it will work just like Microsoft's Bing, so another announcement there.And then they talked about how generative AI is coming across their products, whether that's workspace, the actual Messages texting app for Android, the ability to change your wallpaper on Android, and across a number of other products. So really, the big thing here was generative AI and how Google is putting that across its products and just the business aspect of that being--As they were discussing the search product and Bard, they were sure to point out that advertisements will be a part of that. So you'd be able to do a search in Bard or in Google with the text generative AI capability. And then you would actually see some of those ads show up underneath that generative AI area.So they want to ensure that while they're offering this product, while they're matching or exceeding, potentially, what Microsoft has to offer, they're not leaving behind their core business, which is advertising.","May 10, 2023 at 3:08 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/google-unveils-latest-bard-ai-200824342.html,Yahoo Finance Video,0.5,0.9,0.08801020408163267,0.46010015117157965,2023-05-10 15:08:00,2023-05-10 15:08:00,108.5500030517578,112.27999877929688,-3.7299957275390767
GOOG,Google Says Search Enters New Era With Conversational AI Features,The company intends to use AI programs to provide lengthier replies to queries.

GOOG,"Google unveils the Pixel Fold: a $1,799 foldable smartphone","That would be a sharp contrast from Samsung’s Z Fold, which uses a larger, though thinner 6.2-inch outer screen that can feel cramped while doing things like typing messages. Inside, the Pixel Fold gets a 7.6-inch panel that folds directly down its center line. The Z Fold packs a similar internal display, though it looks as though Samsung’s offering has thinner bezels around its inner screen.Google also claims that the Pixel Fold is the thinnest foldable on the market whether folded or unfolded. That should come as a relief to consumers who’ve balked at Samsung’s bulky Z Fold’s design.Around back, you’ll find the Pixel Fold’s telephoto camera with 5x optical zoom, along with its wide-angle and ultrawide angle cameras. Up front, Google has outfitted the Pixel Fold with a 9.5 megapixel selfie camera, which does double duty as the phone’s Face Unlock camera. A second selfie camera over the inner display allows you to make video chats via the large 7.6-panel.As far as performance goes, the Pixel Fold is powered by Google’s custom Tensor G2 chip and 12GB of RAM. You can opt for 256GB or 512GB of internal storage. Battery life? Google says the Pixel Fold will get more than 24 hours of use out of a single charge. We’ll have to see how those claims stand up in real life, though.All of those specs and numbers are top notch, but what do they actually do for you? The Pixel Fold, like the Z Fold, is meant to provide users with a tablet experience in a compact package. The idea is to give a large canvas to browse the web, watch videos, play games, and take and edit photos.During my time with the Z Fold, however, I noticed that I spent much of my time using the outer display, rather than taking the time to unfold it and use the inner screen. Maybe I’m just lazy, but I simply preferred the outer screen.That’s not to say there aren’t some interesting uses for foldable devices. Google, for instance, touts the Pixel Fold’s ability to let users drag and drop content between an app running on one side of the inner screen and another app running on the other side. You can also easily multitask by running two apps side by side.You can also use the Pixel Fold in tabletop mode to watch movies and TV shows or make video calls hands free.If you prefer reading ebooks, the Pixel Fold is also a solid bet, as it will provide a larger display than a regular non-folding phone. But is all of that worth $1,799? It depends on your priorities.For Google, and its parent Alphabet though, one thing is clear: it’s not ditching its hardware line anytime soon. Despite low market share compared to leaders Apple and Samsung, Google is seemingly dedicated to its Pixel line as a means of diversifying its revenue streams outside of the advertising space.The Pixel Fold is also coming to market at a time when consumers are purchasing fewer smartphones as high interest rates and inflation batter electronics sales. Still, the fold doesn’t need to be a market leader to be a success. It simply needs to help Google gain greater share in the space. But when your main competitors are Apple and Samsung, that’s no easy task.Pixel 7A coming for $499On the other end of the pricing spectrum is Google’s Pixel 7A. A low-cost follow-up to last year’s Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro, the Pixel 7A starts at $499 and packs a 6.1-inch display with an up to 90Hz refresh rate for smooth on-screen animations.The phone offers two rear cameras, wide-angle and ultra-wide angle, and features many of the same software capabilities as Google’s pricier handsets. That includes Magic Eraser, which allows you to easily remove unwanted objects from your photos, and Photo Unblur, which, well, unblurs photos.Like the Pixel Fold and Pixel 7 and 7 Pro, the Pixel 7A gets Google’s custom Tensor G2 chip, as well as 8GB of RAM and up to 128GB of storage. The company also promises battery life will last more than 24 hours during regular use and up to 72 hours on Extreme Battery Saver mode.Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance","May 10, 2023 at 2:02 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/google-unveils-the-pixel-fold-a-1799-foldable-smartphone-190225186.html,Yahoo Finance,0.0,0.0,0.10910782703886152,0.3539818849732642,2023-05-10 14:02:00,2023-05-10 14:02:00,108.5500030517578,112.27999877929688,-3.7299957275390767
GOOG,Gmail and Google Workspace get the AI treatment at Google I/O,"CEO Sundar Pichai kicked off the show emphasizing AI as the show's lead theme. For Gmail, the company is introducing a new feature called ""Help Me Write,"" which serves as a more advanced version of Smart Compose.""Let's say you got this email that your flight was canceled,"" Pichai told the audience. ""The airline has sent a voucher, but what you really want is a full refund. You could reply and use 'Help Me Write.' Just type in the prompt of what you want, an email to ask for a full refund, hit 'create' and a full draft appears.""So, it was all AI, all the time at Google I/O, including for one of the company's most visible products outside Search, Google Workspace – a suite of productivity products that includes apps like Google Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Meet, and Google Drive.According to Google, the suite will now feature Duet AI, a generative AI-based feature that helps users write, pull information from existing documents, and more.For example, Google Slides will now have a feature that helps create speaker notes out of an existing slide show. Similarly, Google Sheets will have a ""Help Me Organize"" feature in which users can describe what they want to do, and then the feature will generate a plan to accomplish that goal.Google Workspace General Manager Aparna Pappu explained what this process might look like on stage at Google I/O.""Imagine you run a dog-walking business and need to keep track of things like your clients' logistics about their dogs, like what time they need to be walked, how long, etc.,"" she said.

GOOG,Google is bringing generative AI to your text messages and phone wallpaper,"Launching later this summer as a Beta release, Magic Compose is meant to help you personalize your texts in the Messages app, allowing you to make your missives sound more concise, professional, or, weirdly, Shakespearean.In one example, Google shows a user writing a note asking another person if they want to get dinner. They then tap the Magic Compose button and are able to choose between different styles of chatting.For instance, if you want your dinner request to sound casual, you can select the “Chill” option and ask “You down for some grub?” There are also options to make your text sound lyrical or exciting. Google says it will offer six types of speech out of the gate.It’s not just Messages either. Google is also adding generative AI to its Android’s smartphone wallpaper. Now when you open up the wallpaper customization screen, there will be an AI option that you can use to quickly change up your home screen’s style.One example Google provided included choosing a city by the bay in a post-impressionist style. The app then popped out a painted image of San Francisco in pastel.The company also debuted new Android 14 capabilities including the ability to customize your lock screen and make cinematic wallpapers out of still photos. The option allows you to take a standard image and, with on-device machine learning, turn it into a moving, 3D-scene that changes when you tilt or unlock your phone. That feature will land on Google’s Pixel devices next month.But Microsoft’s Bing and other generative AI releases, which come as a result of its partnership with ChatGPT developer OpenAI, have left Google looking flat footed by comparison.The company is now playing catch up by rolling out a number of new products using generative AI including its Bard chatbot and its generative AI capabilities in its Workspace productivity suite.Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance","May 10, 2023 at 1:35 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/google-is-bringing-generative-ai-to-your-text-messages-and-phone-wallpaper-183536077.html,Yahoo Finance,0.0,0.0,0.14287518037518038,0.4639159451659452,2023-05-10 13:35:00,2023-05-10 13:35:00,108.5500030517578,112.27999877929688,-3.7299957275390767
GOOG,Google Search is getting generative AI in strike at Microsoft,"For instance, you can search for things like ""Good bike for 5-mile commute with hills."" Search will then provide you with the generative AI page, which will provide you with a list of suggestions for things to look for when searching for bikes for commuting.Below that, you'll see potential follow up questions you can ask, which will pull you into a conversation panel complete with the ability to link directly to bike retailer websites.During a live stage demo, Google's Search Generative Experience pulled up answers for ""Why do whales like to sing?"" The app quickly provided a list of potential reasons for why whales sing, provided images of whales and allowed the user to ask follow up questions.Google is positioning generative AI as the future of search. And as the company's most important product — and largest revenue source — it's no wonder it's moving fast to add the capability to the platform.According to Microsoft, just one percent of market share in search is worth $2 billion of revenue. In other words, even a small portion of the pie is worth the investment.Now it's up to Google to prove it deserves to stay in the lead.Correction: Google's generative search feature is called Search Generative Experience.

GOOG,Why Meta's digital ad numbers are trouncing competitors right now: Nicola Mendelsohn,"Meta's ad revenue numbers were a notable beat, coming in at $28.1 billion versus the $26.7 billion that Wall Street was expecting. That suggests that, at least for Meta, digital advertisers are finding their way forward.Though Alphabet clocked a small beat on its YouTube ad revenue and expressed some optimism about a stabilizing ad market, that optimism didn't exist across the board. For example, in the company's earnings call, the Google parent's chief business officer Philipp Schindler noted that ""in network, there was an incremental pullback in advertiser spend.""At Roku, it was a similar story of choppy waters in digital advertising; ad spending in some areas improved, but other areas remained pressured.Why was Meta's story more positive? In part, it was tied to the increasing success of new products such as Reels and investments in AI, Mendelsohn said.""[Reels is] one of our fastest growing products, and what we saw just in the last handful of months was a doubling of the amount of Reels being shared every day to 2 billion Reels being shared,"" she said. ""That's people commenting and sharing and discussing and debating and really enjoying the content that they're seeing. A lot of that has been powered by the investments that we've been making in artificial intelligence and machine learning.""Mendelsohn also identified messaging as a key ad opportunity, especially for WhatsApp, Instagram Direct, and Messenger.""We're seeing that one of the products that have that we call [Click to Message] actually enables advertisers to start a conversation in one of the individual threads,"" she said. ""That now has a runway of $10 billion.""Meta's goal is, in large part, to make it easy for advertisers to use its platforms, according to Mendelsohn.To that end, Mendelsohn also delineated how AI, a key theme that CEO Mark Zuckerberg spoke about in the company's latest earnings call, fits into Meta's advertising strategy.Meta's automated Advantage+ ad products are AI-powered, and they're ""helping advertisers that want a reduction in the cost to actually reach the people that matter to them,"" Mendelsohn said. She explained that Meta, which has been using AI in one form or another since 2006, uses the technology in three ways.""We use it to surface and bubble up the best content for you, that you, the individual among those 3.8 billion people, see the things that matter most to you,"" Mendelsohn said.""We also use it to take content off the platform, any type of harmful content, misinformation. We're doing that through machine learning and AI,"" she added. ""Then, finally, from the advertising side and monetization of our products, then it's really about making sure we put the right products in front of the right people at the right time.""Between Meta's AI-infused ad products and its focus on efficiency this year, some on Wall Street have taken notice.Click here for the latest technology business news, reviews, and useful articles on tech and gadgetsRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance","May 10, 2023 at 10:59 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-metas-digital-ad-numbers-are-trouncing-competitors-right-now-nicola-mendelsohn-155924039.html,Yahoo Finance,0.14285714285714285,0.26785714285714285,0.16136918636918635,0.48204110704110703,2023-05-10 10:59:00,2023-05-10 10:59:00,108.5500030517578,112.27999877929688,-3.7299957275390767

That's a major change from the early version of Bard, which only worked with text.You'll also be able to upload images and then ask Bard to write captions for them. The company provided and example of a person uploading a photo of her dogs and then have Bard write up a few lines based on how the dogs look.According to Sissie Hsiao, vice president and general manager for Google Assistant and Bard, the software's most-used feature is coding. To that end, the company is rolling out the ability to collaborate with code. Hsiao says that the assistant currently understands more than 20 coding languages and is adding more.Hsiao says Bard will also help users pull together content from multiple sources. In one example, she showed how a student can piece together a college application letter and then find colleges that line up with their specific interests.Bard can then pull those colleges up in Google Maps to help find their locations and then move all of that information into a table. You can then ask Bard to tell you which schools are public and which are private, and it will automatically add them to the table, which you can then move directly into Google Sheets to collaborate with your family members.But Microsoft’s Bing and other generative AI releases, which come as a result of its partnership with ChatGPT developer OpenAI, have left Google looking flat footed by comparison.The company is now playing catch up by rolling out a number of new products using generative AI including its Bard chatbot and its generative AI capabilities in its Workspace productivity suite.Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance","May 10, 2023 at 12:45 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/google-bard-will-work-with-images-more-apps-as-company-pushes-generative-ai-174500702.html,Yahoo Finance,0.5,0.5,0.10643939393939394,0.3857503607503608,2023-05-10 12:45:00,2023-05-10 12:45:00,108.5500030517578,112.27999877929688,-3.7299957275390767
GOOG,Stocks trade higher at the open as investors digest April CPI data,"Yahoo Finance Live’s Brad Smith breaks down how stocks are trading following the opening bell on Wednesday.NASDAQ Composite, you're seeing that higher by about 9/10 of a percent three days, still net positive. And the S&P 500, as well, now net positive with today's move. And so that is the importance of continuing to track this CPI data and any of the economic data reads to see how the market is digesting that. Because without this morning's moves, over the past three days, we would not be in positive territory for the S&P 500 or for the NASDAQ, and definitely not for the Dow as well.So, ultimately, we'll keep a close eye on that. Let's also take a look at the 11 S&P 500 sectors here as we pull it up on our handy-dandy heat map. Taking a look at them right now. We're in positive territory across the board. Take a look at consumer discretionary and technology. Consumer discretionary right now up by about 1.2%.Technology also higher by about 1.1%. Speaking of technology, let's go to the tech-heavy NASDAQ. Take a look at some of those mega-cap tech stocks out the gate this morning.

GOOG,Tech earnings featured more stock buybacks here's what that means for investors,"""Our main takeaway is that share buybacks don't create or destroy a lot of wealth,"" Guest told Yahoo Finance Live (video above). ""So you might wonder, 'Well, why are companies repurchasing on track for more than $1 trillion this year?' The benefits seem to be an opportunity for management to signal that they believe the stock is undervalued.""""Some argue they're associated with excessive executive compensation and that companies that buy back don't have as much cash available to take advantage of investment opportunities, thereby sacrificing growth and ultimately profitability,"" he said. ""But our evidence comparing both companies that repurchased and companies that don't repurchase shares didn't find any large-scale, on average, evidence of those things.""""$70 billion is slightly large for them, but not when you compare and adjust market-wide,"" he said. ""The best way to think about $70 billion is to compare against the market cap because you can better normalize market-wide. $70 billion is equal to 5.2% of the market cap at Google.""So why do these companies do stock buybacks?""Repurchases have more flexibility than dividends,"" Guest said. ""They're easier to temporarily cut during downtime, and repurchasing shares reduces the amount of cash that could be misused on management's pet projects.""Another reason, Guest added, is that ""managers and others — the board, for example — can use repurchased shares to compensate employees. So those seem to be the benefits, as opposed to improving long-term profitability or creating additional investment opportunities.""It's worth doing buybacks when management thinks the company's valuation is low, Ragih said.""The best time to do a buyback is when the valuation is low because companies get the most bang for their buyback,"" he told Yahoo Finance. ""If Google spends $15 billion, they’d want to get the most amount of shares for that $15 billion – lower stock price will get them more shares for the same overall dollar value of spend.""It's even more worthwhile if the company in question has the cash, which Alphabet does, Ragih added.""Google has a high amount of free cash flow and not much else to spend it on, so it’s appropriate to return cash to shareholders,"" he said. ""To boil it down, after they pay for organic investments, they still have a lot of cash left each quarter. The cash balance is about $100 billion so they defer to buybacks.""However, buyback backlash has increased in recent years. Critics say that they enrich companies and executives without improving the overall economy. So over time, shareholders may see fewer buybacks if that trend continues.""If the disincentives increase — for example, if we get this 4% tax or other limits on what managers can do in terms of selling their own shares after the company has bought back shares, and other potential restrictions — then some firms might decide to retain the cash instead or switch to dividends, which both could have negative consequences,"" Guest said. ""For example, dividends, as we know, are taxed as income tax, ... whereas repurchases typically generate a capital gain. So that could create some additional costs for shareholders.""Click here for the latest technology business news, reviews, and useful articles on tech and gadgetsRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance","May 9, 2023 at 3:56 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tech-earnings-featured-more-stock-buybacks--heres-what-that-means-for-investors-205638384.html,Yahoo Finance,0.5,0.5,0.19141508250203906,0.3927346445824706,2023-05-09 15:56:00,2023-05-09 15:56:00,108.77999877929688,107.94000244140624,0.8399963378906392
GOOG,Google I/O 2023: What to expect during Googles huge developer event,"Tuesday, May 9, 2023And the push to change that should kick off in earnest at I/O.“What I would anticipate from Google I/O is a very strong generative AI-forward message where Google re-seizes the mantle for AI leadership…and you will likely see announcements specifically focused on that,” Gartner Analyst Chirag Dekate told Yahoo Finance.You should expect to hear plenty of other announcements tied to both of those products.“I would not be surprised if Google announced that it's expanding those features to Google Sheets or to Google Slides, or to make them more generally available to the masses not trusted trusted testers,” Forrester Analyst Nikhil Lai told Yahoo Finance.“Google, I think, bungled its launch of Bard. The stock tumbled when they fumbled that launch and the inaccuracy of Bard has been problematic,” Lai said. “When when users sign into Bard it talks about the limitations...so I think we'll see some enhancements there.”It’s not just about Bard and Workspace, though. Google will likely announce new generative AI features across its product lines including its all-important search engine.Google’s search business powers the company’s massive advertising division, which generates the bulk of its $283 billion in revenue in 2022. Any changes to its search product are a risky endeavor, but with Microsoft’s Bing already bringing AI chatbots to search, Google has to respond.“The good news is I think the market is headed where Google has been traditionally quite strong,” Dekate explained. “Google has always been, ever since its inception…an AI-centric company. The only problem is that Google has not spoken a lot about what they've been doing in generative AI for the longest time.”That should change at I/O, though, as the company looks to put its generative AI chops on full display.But Google isn’t just expected to roll out AI apps and services. The company will also show off its Pixel Fold smartphone. We already got a look at the foldable handset thanks to a teaser Google posted of the phone last week.Like Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 5, the Pixel Fold features a cover display and a foldable internal display that opens up into a larger tablet-style screen. There appears to be a three camera setup on the back of the phone, suggesting it’ll sport telephoto, ultra-wide angle, and wide angle lenses. According to CNBC, the Pixel Fold will cost upwards of $1,700.There’s also reportedly a Pixel Tablet in the works. And you can likely expect to get a glimpse at Google’s upcoming Android 14 and maybe even its next-generation smartphone, the Pixel 8.Be sure to check back in at Yahoo Finance for all of the news out of Google I/O when it kicks off Wednesday, May 10.Click here for the latest technology business news, reviews, and useful articles on tech and gadgetsRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance","May 9, 2023 at 1:05 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/google-io-2023-what-to-expect-during-googles-huge-developer-event-180510466.html,Yahoo Finance,0.4000000000000001,0.9,0.17350108225108224,0.5525631313131313,2023-05-09 13:05:00,2023-05-09 13:05:00,108.77999877929688,107.94000244140624,0.8399963378906392
GOOG,"Wendy's, Google preview partnership with new AI-powered drive-thru","Yahoo Finance culinary correspondent Brooke DiPalma joins the Live Show to discuss the partnership between Wendy's and Google to revolutionize drive-thru orders with the use of AI technology, first premiering in Columbus, Ohio in June of this year, and how AI is transforming the restaurant industry.That partnership began in 2021. This is called Wendy's Fresh AI. The first pilot of Wendy's Fresh AI sets launch in June in Columbus, Ohio near its headquarters in Dublin, Ohio. Now, in addition to that, the company wants you to know that the AI technology has the ability to understand made to order requests, which they say includes billions of different combinations.For example, if a customer asks for a large milkshake, this technology will know that they're asking for a frosty. In addition to that, they said that it'll be as natural as interacting with employees. Eager to see if customers think so as well. And in this pilot customers can expect a female voice. Now, what you also need to know is that Wendy's expects here to improve speed, accuracy, and consistency with this automated technology.And based on this pilot, Wendy's is looking for a few key things in addition to that drive-through speed. The customer is also taking a closer look at order averages. They hope to see a boost in sales with upselling opportunities that the AI technology will offer like larger sizes, asking customers perhaps if they want a frosty with their orders, in addition to daily specials. And this comes as drive-through remains a key opportunity for Wendy's. About 75% to 80% of Wendy's customers prefer drive-thru now, Seana, that's a big jump compared to roughly 2/3 before the COVID 19 pandemic.And Wendy's hoping to be not only a game changer here, but a leader in AI technology and the drive-thru.Wingstop in March partnered with AI voice startup Converse. Now they're running a pilot where they're using voice AI powered virtual assistants to take customers' phone orders at select locations. We're also seeing Yum Brands using recommended ordering to understand how much food is needed at restaurants.And Chipotle using AI for kitchen management to streamline operations. They also introduced Chippy the robot and what they call an AI kitchen assistant to make chips. Chipotle's CFO also weighed in on the opportunity saying that it is taking a well thought out approach. Take a listen.Perhaps, you'll be ordering your drive-thru a little bit different in the near future.","May 9, 2023 at 3:54 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/wendys-google-preview-partnership-ai-205440386.html,Yahoo Finance Video,0.13636363636363635,0.45454545454545453,0.04858266733266733,0.40718864468864463,2023-05-09 15:54:00,2023-05-09 15:54:00,108.77999877929688,107.94000244140624,0.8399963378906392

GOOG,Google set to launch foldable Pixel smartphone,"Yahoo Finance’s Daniel Howley joins the Live show to discuss the expectations for Google I/O 2023, an annual developer conference held by Google in Mountain View, CA.[AUDIO LOGO]Likely, we'll hear conversation about how Google is going to start putting that kind of technology into its search product. So they've discussed how they want to do that. In the past, they announced their Bard AI chatbot. That's in limited preview, so maybe we'll get that available to everyone at some point. And then the search aspect and how generative AI would go into search.But then, as you said, we have those phones also coming. There's the foldable that, you know, looks really, really interesting. They showed it off in a tweet. And I mean, we have seen foldable phones from competitors, like Samsung, but this one looks like it's got a few differences from the Samsung foldable to make it interesting, though. To be honest, I'm still not totally sold on a foldable phone yet.Dan, unlike Apple, Google can't seem to keep new devices under wraps, though. And so with this foldable Pixel device, you know, how does this all play into their broader kind of tech strategy or at least consumer technology strategy?So it's something that they use to, basically, serve as a platform for other companies to say, look, this is what an Android phone is capable of doing when done as we see fit, or as we want it to be done. And so they focus on a lot of different technologies inside the device, whether that's reducing motion blur, night photography-- that's some of the best out there-- special capabilities for when you receive a phone call.So they do have all of this AI smarts, or these AI smarts, in their phones that you really won't find on other devices. But the hardware themselves, you know, it's something that margins aren't gonna be as good as the advertising services. And so it's never gonna be kind of the main bread and butter for Google and Alphabet. It'll continue to be the search side.

GOOG,Apple isnt playing the AI hype game,"In fact, Cook didn’t mention the topic at all in his statement. The only time the CEO broached the topic was when he was prodded by Credit Suisse’s Shannon Cross, who asked for Cook’s thoughts on generative AI and where he sees it going. True to form, the CEO was light on specifics.Despite not mentioning the hottest buzzword since blockchain in his statement, shares of Cook’s Apple jumped more than 4% Friday. It’s not as though Apple doesn’t use AI either. Nearly every product Apple offers takes advantage of AI and machine learning.Cook specifically called out the company’s use of the technology to power the Apple Watch’s fall detection and ECG, as well as the crash detection capabilities in the watch and iPhone.“It's absolutely remarkable,” Cook said. “And so we view AI as huge and we'll continue weaving it in our products on a very thoughtful basis.”Apple is also set to hold its annual WWDC developer conference next month, during which it could make some kind of announcement regarding generative AI.But Apple’s ethos is to let technology largely fade into the background while boosting its products as a means to an end. In other words, if Apple does begin implementing some form of generative AI into its product portfolio, don’t expect the company to dwell on the fact that it’s doing so.If anything, you’ll hear about how the technology will power an updated version of Siri, or perhaps become a new assistant meant to help you better plan things like trips or your daily work schedule.However Apple decides to approach generative AI, bank on the company focusing more on how it helps its products, rather than the tech itself.For the latest earnings reports and analysis, earnings whispers and expectations, and company earnings news, click hereRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance","May 5, 2023 at 2:07 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-isnt-playing-the-ai-hype-game-190726240.html,Yahoo Finance,-0.4,0.4,0.28312615955473097,0.5003865182436611,2023-05-05 14:07:00,2023-05-05 14:07:00,105.31999969482422,106.21499633789062,-0.8949966430664062

GOOG,You can now sign up for Microsoft's Bing without a waitlist,"In a press announcement early Thursday, Microsoft CVP Yusuf Mehdi announced that Bing, which is powered by OpenAI’s GPT-4 technology, is now available to the general public as an open preview. In other words, you can now use Bing without first having to sign up for a waitlist as long as you have a Microsoft account.More important than making Bing available to the general public, though, is word that Microsoft is making it so third-party developers can build their own app plug-ins into the software.“For example, if you’re researching the latest restaurant for dinner in Bing chat, it will leverage OpenTable to help you find and book a reservation,” Mehdi explained in a statement. “Or, with Wolfram|Alpha, you can create powerful visualizations and get answers to complex science, math, and human-curated data-based questions directly from Bing chat.”The idea is to make Bing chat a kind of one-stop shop for search, allowing consumers to both ask questions and receive answers via text and images.Mehdi says Bing is also expanding its existing Bing Image Creator, which is a part of Bing chat, to 100 more languages, opening up the app to far more users than before.In the future, he says, you’ll also be able to upload images to Bing chat and search for similar content.In terms of basic capabilities, Bing is also adding the ability to go back to your chat history and pick up where you left off during a previous session. You’ll also be able to export and share your chats to other apps. Microsoft, though, didn’t say which apps outside of Microsoft Word.According to Mehdi, Bing users have already taken part in 500 million chats with the bot in the 90 days since it went live. The app now has 100 million users and mobile app downloads have increased 4x.But Microsoft isn’t looking to dethrone the search giant just yet. When discussing the potential for search, the company speaks in terms of market share percentages. When the company debuted Bing in February, Microsoft representatives said that every one percent of market share Bing can take from Google is worth $2 billion in revenue.With Microsoft continuing to innovate on Bing, and Google’s Bard still in a limited preview, the Windows maker could be backing its rival into a corner.Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance","May 4, 2023 at 2:00 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/you-can-now-sign-up-for-microsofts-bing-without-a-waitlist-070003038.html,Yahoo Finance,0.0,0.0,0.16534021534021534,0.4737484737484738,2023-05-04 02:00:00,2023-05-04 02:00:00,106.16000366210938,105.20999908447266,0.9500045776367188
GOOG,Apples earnings could buoy or sink Big Techs earnings season,"Wednesday, May 3, 2023“None of what's already been reported matters come Thursday night,” explained Deepwater Asset Management Managing Partner Gene Munster.“And the reason is ... because [of] the size of Apple, and also it's been relatively stable too. It's done a better job of enduring this versus other tech, so if there is a problem, you can throw out all the good news from Microsoft and Google and Meta,” Munster added.In turn, a solid result from Apple could help buoy the industry and drive up shares of other Big Tech names. But a miss could mean increased pressure on rival tech stocks, just as the sector looks to finally move past its COVID-induced hangover.Analysts expect Apple to report revenue of $92.6 billion for the second quarter, a 4.8% decline from the $97.3 billion Apple brought in during the same quarter last year. That's about in line with the 5% decline Apple posted in Q1.“We believe the broader tech industry is all on pins and needles waiting for Apple's results as many of the tech haters continue to yell fire in a crowded theater around softening demand, with Apple the best barometer globally of this metric,” Wedbush Managing Director Dan Ives told Yahoo Finance via email.For investors tracking the S&P 500, a miss by Apple could have an outsized impact on their portfolios.While Apple’s enormous size and weight relative to market competitors gives its results added importance, the company’s performance is also a key indicator for consumer spending.“Most, if not all, iPhones are purchased for consumers. Macs, for the most part, are purchased for consumers and/or small, medium businesses,” explained UBS Managing Director David Vogt. “So it's really more of a bellwether or a barometer regarding high end consumer spending.”A miss on Apple’s revenue, especially for its iPhone business, would mean consumers are spending less and holding back on making large purchases. Worse still would be any signal that revenue will come in weaker than anticipated in Q3. That would signal that Apple anticipates customers will continue to hold back on spending their cash.It all comes down to Thursday night.

GOOG,Warren Buffett: Heres how to invest like the Berkshire Hathaway CEO,"So what exactly is his investment philosophy? It’s centered around the principle of value investing, which involves finding undervalued companies that focus on long-term earnings rather than short-term growth.In other words, rather than buying stocks, he buys businesses that have a competitive advantage. This approach has made him one of the most successful investors in history, and anyone can invest like him by following his strategies.Buffett says he buys what he knows, which is why Berkshire is the largest shareholder in Coca-Cola and Kraft Heinz.Does his approach cause him to miss a few big winners? Sure. He passed on Tesla and Google and was very late to Apple and Amazon.To invest like Buffett, buy what you know. Buy a business, not a stock.

GOOG,"Tech earnings: It will take about three quarters to see rebound in ad market, analyst says","R ""Ray"" Wang, Constellation Research Principal Analyst & Founder discusses the upcoming week in tech earnings and previews if he believes the market is ready for a rebound.Microsoft is much more top-down. And so they launched all the ChatGPT, the co-pilots, and went full on against Google for digital ads, as well as where they were going with their open AI investment. So it's a two-horse race, and it's going be interesting to see what happens. But the bottom line is we might not have enough data to be able to do all the things at a level of precision.So if your AI physician is 93% accurate, would you do it? Probably not. But if your search for checking what's going on for self-help on a contact center call is 83% accurate, that's a win. And so we're going to see different gradations of where AI plays a role and what your comfort level is going to be.But the good news is you can do it much more quickly. If you're writing a paper or if you're actually coding, now snippets and codes are actually going to be reused very, very quickly. And so, now, you got to get really good at finding bugs or finding errors. So you change the skill sets that you're using-- just like back when I was in school-- you couldn't bring a calculator to an exam. Now everyone has these super graphical calculators that are doing all these kind of things.But we also need to have a couple of levels of ethics. First, algorithms need to be transparent. We understand what's going on. We make decisions by bias. But if you have unwanted bias, we actually have to be able to understand what's happening with that, so it's got to be explainable. But once you have that in place, how do you reverse things? So you're discriminating against left-handed people with purple hair? Oh, I'm so sorry. How do we actually reverse that so we learn from that? And of course, we have to train this over time.

GOOG,AI talk prevails in tech earnings calls,"Yahoo Finance Tech Editor Dan Howley discusses the predominant mentions of AI development amongst tech earnings this week.But when we look at how many times-- just rattling this off is-- it doesn't really give you a total understanding of what the calls had to say, but just giving you an idea. Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Alphabet, mentioned AI 34 times during his opening remarks for the call. That doesn't include the question-and-answer part. Satya Nadella-- 31 times. And Mark Zuckerberg during his own call-- 22 times.This is just showing how important the AI space is to these companies. Now, we obviously have this kind of inkling that Microsoft is in the lead at this point because of its partnership with OpenAI. Google really trying to say, whoa, whoa, whoa, we basically helped create the technology that OpenAI uses, this transformer technology. We did the papers on it, the research.And then Meta is saying, hey, the Metaverse is cool and all. We're still going to invest in that. But AI is something that we really want to talk about. They jumped in to start off discussions with Mark Zuckerberg pointing towards the company's layoffs, but then right away dove into AI and how the company's innovating there and working on it and has been using it and will continue to use it. And it's going to help the Metaverse and vice versa. So AI-- so far, at least-- the leading piece of conversation. We still have big names like Apple and Nvidia coming.ChatGPT is more or less a souped up version of that, right? So it's not as though this technology is incredibly new. It's being implemented in ways that are exciting and new. Microsoft basically just laying it across its entire stack. Google working on that as well. Meta trying to figure out where they kind of fit in this conversation exactly. They were talking about chat bots. It's kind of been there, done that before, but let's see where generative AI can bring us.So I do think that it is part hype, part actual product. But we need to see where that actual product goes and how beneficial these are.

GOOG,This earnings season is all about AI,"If there’s one lesson we can take away from first-quarter earnings so far, it’s that Big Tech’s CEOs are all in on AI. Need proof? Just listen to what they have to say during their companies’ earnings calls.The CEO mentioned AI 34 times in his opening remarks alone. It was the first topic he covered, ahead of Alphabet’s cost-cutting efforts and even Google Cloud, which the company is trying to grow to catch up to cloud offerings from rivals Microsoft and Amazon.“Our investments and breakthroughs in AI over the last decade have positioned us well,” Pichai said during the call. He then went on to explain how AI is already being used or being built into everything from Google’s advertising offerings to its productivity suite.And, of course, the CEO was sure to mention how Google is working to bring generative AI to its all-important search business.“We’ll be guided by data and years of experience about what people want and our high standards for quality,” he said. “And we will test and iterate as we go, because we know that billions of people trust Google to provide the right information.Alphabet finds itself in an unfamiliar position. The company has long dominated AI research thanks to its world-class teams. Heck, Google is responsible for some of the research behind the transformer technology that powers OpenAI’s ChatGPT.“We are focused on continuing to raise the bar on our operational excellence and performance, as we innovate to help our customers maximize the value of their existing technology investments and thrive in the new era of AI,” Nadella said.And nowhere was Nadella more emphatic about the company’s AI future than when he mentioned how it will impact Microsoft’s quest to take on Google Search with its own Bing search engine.“We look forward to continuing this journey in what is a generational shift in the largest software category – search,” Nadella said.He mentioned AI 22 times during his rundown on the call, saying it’s improving monetization for the company’s ads, driving recommendation engines for its services, and could lead to AI chat bots for Messenger and WhatsApp. Zuckerberg also dove into how the company is investing in the infrastructure needed to power its AI ambitions.Naturally, the CEO tied his company’s AI efforts with his long-term plans for the metaverse. Zuckerberg insisted that he’s not ditching the metaverse in favor of AI, and instead said that the two technologies will benefit each other.Meta, like Alphabet and Microsoft, has a powerful AI division and has been working in the space for years. But the excitement generated by OpenAI and ChatGPT has forced the company to respond by putting AI front and center in its investor statements.There’s still a cavalcade of companies preparing to report their quarterly results, including the likes of Apple and Nvidia.

GOOG,AI 'misunderstood' by companies: Builder.AI Founder,"Artificial Intelligence's staggering rise in the last few months has left investors confident in its ability to transform sectors; it's also forcing companies to adjust their game plans. Some experts however, are seeing a different side of the story, as valuations of AI-related entities continue to rocket ever higher. ""The most important thing I'm hearing is a little bit of hysteria meets a little bit of confusion"", Sachin Dev Duggal the founder of Builder AI tells Yahoo Finance's Julie Hyman and Ines Ferre.The man behind the platform that allows people to build software applications using the technology, says AI is ""misunderstood"" by businesses. Offering the promise of self-driving cars, high-intelligence chat bots and large-scale data analysis, companies are seemingly jumping on the bandwagon. ""It's something new and everybody's talking about it,"" he says. ""But it's coming with an equal dose of confusion, in terms of how they might use it, is it really new, will they have to change their labor hiring and labor patterns.""Key Video Moments:00:00:15: AI areas of growth00:01:55: Hysteria meets confusion00:02:20: AI customer feedbackSo we actually think some of the interesting places to invest are companies that have deployed end-use assets and can deliver AI software to those assets. So take Tesla, has the largest deployed fleet of robots in the world. If you can turn those cars they sold into robotaxis, then that transforms their economic model. Given the pace of advance in AI, Tesla is better positioned to take economic advantage of it than some of the underlying AI-focused tech companies that are beginning to compete with each other in a really aggressive way.But Sachin, I'm curious, there is such of this clamoring about AI. What are you hearing from customers and potential customers? Is this something that they are getting really excited about here? And just for people who aren't familiar, give us, like, the 20-second description of what you guys do.And what we're hearing from customers is an element of excitement because it's something new, and everybody is talking about it, but it's coming with an equal dose of confusion in terms of how they might use it. Is it really new? Will they have to change sort of their labor hiring and labor patterns? And it overall just seems very misunderstood, especially given we are probably in the AOL of the AI world right now, whereas the perception with some folks is that we're in the fiberoptic world of AOL-- of broadband.","April 28, 2023 at 12:57 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/ai-misunderstood-companies-builder-ai-175733268.html,Yahoo Finance Video,0.0,0.0,0.07864357864357863,0.49108044733044726,2023-04-28 12:57:00,2023-04-28 12:57:00,107.8000030517578,108.22000122070312,-0.4199981689453267

GOOG,"Alphabet, Meta, Amazon: The ad spend gloom continues","Yahoo Finance’s Daniel Howley joins the Live show to discuss the ad spend gloom hovering over the tech sector.Joining us now with more is Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley. So break down this difference that we've seen with these different tech firms.On the flip side, we have Meta-- Facebook parent company Meta. They seem to be righting the ship after three consecutive quarters of revenue declines. They've turned that around and they are doing better in the advertising space.We also have, as you mentioned, Amazon, which has continued to push itself deeper and deeper into advertising. They saw revenues increase this year. It jumped, I believe, 21% year over year. If you adjust for FX though-- or if you exclude for FX though, excuse me-- they had dropped from, let's see-- they had 25% growth year over year in Q1 2022 down to 23% this year. Though they had that 21%, which was actually up from 19% when you do factor in FX. So obviously, they're doing well in that space.And then we just look at the likes of Snap and Pinterest. Snap is just a story that-- I mean, woof, that has not been great. I was following the earnings yesterday. You just saw the stock price get slammed after they announced their poor performance. And we look at Pinterest and they announced a deal with Amazon, basically saying, look, we're going to let Amazon run ads on our platform for different goods. People will then be able to click into those ads and purchase them directly through Amazon in one click, since most people who are likely using Pinterest are also Amazon users, and they can just get their account set up right away.So the advertising space really does continue to remain challenged, but there are some ""winners,"" quote unquote, at this point. And it appears that Meta really is the one that's seeming to pull away. There's a lot of talk about how they've really kind of optimized with AI. That was something that Mark Zuckerberg has talked about. I mean, you could basically throw AI in any conversation at this point and investors are going to go nuts because, I mean, it's basically the hot topic at this point.So it'll make the experience a lot easier for consumers. And you know, this means that Amazon is going to get a cut of those sales. And ideally, Pinterest will as well. They don't really give full terms of the agreement in the announcement, but you can imagine that they're both going to benefit in some way. And they think this is something that is obviously beneficial to Amazon because they're getting the sales done, but also because their advertising platform just continues to grow.I said, you know, obviously there have been some-- there's been some declining growth, but still growth. And that really just goes to show that the strength of appearing on their top spot, when it comes to products, video ads, anything along those lines, Amazon just continues to grow. And this was a footnote a few years ago.And just as they've built this out, it continues to be a more important part of the equation for them. It's not going to become the sole purpose for Amazon. AWS and actual retail sales are going to continue to dominate. But you know, where you see them struggling when it comes to retail, they do have this kind of third leg to kind of stand on. Again, it's not nearly as big as that. But it is something that's growing and could help them kind of even their business out when they go through times like this.","April 28, 2023 at 10:32 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/alphabet-meta-amazon-ad-spend-153206821.html,Yahoo Finance Video,-0.13333333333333333,0.13333333333333333,0.17186356924729018,0.4880075673680324,2023-04-28 10:32:00,2023-04-28 10:32:00,107.8000030517578,108.22000122070312,-0.4199981689453267

GOOG,"Mark Zuckerberg says AI boosts monetization by 30% on Instagram, 40% on Facebook","Time spent on Instagram went up by 24% since Meta launched AI-powered Instagram reels.“(Generative AI) is going to also help create more engaging experiences, which should create more engagement,” Meta Founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg said on the company’s earnings call Wednesday evening. “And that by itself creates more opportunities for advertisers.”In the first quarter, Meta delivered advertising revenue of $28.1 billion, above Wall Street estimates of $26.76. The company’s $2.20 earnings per share also topped analyst expectations of $2.01. Meta projects second quarter revenue in a range of $29.5 billion to $32 billion, above estimates of $29.48 billion.The stock of the company, formerly known as Facebook, rose as much as 14% in intraday trading on Thursday.AI is having its moment on tech earnings calls for the second consecutive quarter, following the widely popular launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT in late November. But not every company has the same plans for the new technology.Meta’s approach is slightly different. The core business for Meta since the early days of Facebook has been advertising sales, which still account for 98% of the company’s quarterly revenue. So naturally, enhancing advertisements with AI is where Meta believes the new technology can be most impactful.Those losses had weighed heavily on Meta’s stock in the past, but amid Meta’s “year of efficiency,” cost-cutting efforts and AI benefits have Wall Street turning more bullish. In a note to clients on Wednesday, Deutsche Bank research analyst Benjamin Black highlighted AI-driven ad performance as a catalyst for accelerating revenue growth through the rest of 2023.Zuckerberg noted on the earnings call he feels Meta is “no longer behind"" in building out an AI infrastructure. Now, the focus shifts to finding new ways to integrate and optimize the technology.“This is literally going to touch every single one of our products and services in multiple ways,” Zuckerberg said. “This is just a very big wave and new set of technologies that's available, and we're working on it across the whole company.Josh is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance","April 27, 2023 at 1:11 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mark-zuckerberg-says-ai-boosts-monetization-by-30-on-instagram-40-on-facebook-181123177.html,Yahoo Finance,0.0,0.0,0.1422989291410344,0.38563511050353155,2023-04-27 13:11:00,2023-04-27 13:11:00,105.2300033569336,108.37000274658205,-3.1399993896484517

GOOG,"Meta, Roku, Alphabet earnings: Ad figures dominate tech","Yahoo Finance’s Allie Garfinkle joins the Live show to discuss advertising beats for Meta, Roku, and Alphabet following quarterly earnings.And it was pretty impressive, frankly. They clocked a very notable advertising beat. They also had Q2 guidance that called for a 7% growth in advertising demand next quarter. They're also building out new products, like Advantage+ is what it's called. And the goal of it is simplifying advertising for marketers while improving results, right?So it's the sort of thing that was really surprising, especially given that we've heard a very different story from Alphabet, from Roku. Let's start with Roku, for example. They did clock a solid quarter overall. But that week Q2 guidance, they tied it back to continuing uncertainty in ads.And you got a similar story out of Alphabet, right? In YouTube ads, we even saw this incremental pullback in advertiser spend, is what they called it in the earnings call. And the YouTube advertising revenues were actually down 3%, as was the case for network advertising revenues which were down 8%.So you have Meta which has these beats and this optimism. And you have Alphabet and Roku which are saying, no, this is still happening. The pullback is still in place. So what is going on here?And I actually tie it back to something that a lot of experts have been telling me, which is that we are sort of towards the end of the cycle in the digital ad slowdown. It's just a matter of how close to the end of the cycle we are. So that's where we're seeing this mismatch.And I think that, you know, Meta has really set itself out to come out on top here. That said, let's not be too excited. I know that hearing that end of the digital ad cycle slow down sounds really exciting for investors. I wouldn't be too excited about Snap today.I know the stock's up, what, 2 and 1/2%, almost 3% perhaps. I wouldn't be-- I wouldn't be too optimistic just yet because even though Meta has certainly come out ahead and certainly shown us something else, we still possibly have a ways to go here before the advertising market is truly at its peak again.And part of the reason I say that it's important to keep expectations to a minimum, perhaps, for Snap is that Meta has this incredible infrastructure. And actually, it does tie back to the AI story they've been telling. They were very keen to really tie AI into advertising, the metaverse.And I'd say-- I'd say fundamentally here, let's not forget that Meta's core has always been advertising. It is truly what Meta, arguably, has been best at for so, so long. And in the end, we will see-- we will see a pullback-- we will see no a pull-- not a pullback, a push forward of sorts moving ahead. It's just a matter sort of when.

GOOG,Amazon earnings preview: Here's what to expect,"Amazon CFO Brian Olsavsky told investors on the company's earnings call AWS customers are continuing ""optimizations"" in their spending and guided to a notable slowdown in growth from the segment, spooking investors.Amazon shares were down about 2% near 8:00 p.m. ET Thursday evening.""As expected, customers continue to evaluate ways to optimize their cloud spending in response to these tough economic conditions in the first quarter,"" Amazon CFO Brian Olsavsky told analysts on the company's earnings call. ""We are seeing these optimizations continue into the second quarter with April revenue growth rates about 500 basis points lower than what we saw in Q1.""Revenue in Amazon's AWS unit grew 16% during the first quarter, down from an annual growth rate of 37% seen in the same quarter last year.Olsavsky sought to cushion the blow of this guidance by telling investors, ""we're not trying to optimize for any one quarter or year. We're working to build customer relationships and a business that will outlast all of us.""Amazon stock popped as much as 10% late Thursday as investors digested revenues, profits, margins, and current quarter guidance that all blew past Wall Street's expectations.Here are the headline numbers from Amazon's report, compared to analysts' estimates compiled by Bloomberg:""Our Stores business is continuing to improve the cost to serve in our fulfillment network while increasing the speed with which we get products into the hands of customers (we expect to have our fastest Prime delivery speeds ever in 2023),"" Jassy said.""Our Advertising business continues to deliver robust growth, largely due to our ongoing machine learning investments that help customers see relevant information when they engage with us, which in turn delivers unusually strong results for brands.""On the company's earnings call, both Jassy and Olsavsky also spoke about the still-wary customer, both on the e-commerce and AWS sides of the business.""We saw moderated spending on discretionary categories as well as shifts to lower-priced items and healthy demand in everyday essentials, such as consumables and beauty,"" said Olsavsky.This in some ways mirrors what Amazon is seeing among cloud customers, Jassy added.""In AWS, what we're seeing is enterprises continuing to be cautious in their spending in this uncertain time,"" he told analysts. ""Customers are looking for ways to save money however they can right now. They tell us that most of it is cost-optimizing versus cost-cutting, which is an interesting distinction because they say they're cost optimizing to reallocate those resources on new customer experiences.""Much of the initial excitement around Amazon's quarter, however, can be seen in the growth that returned to some parts of the business.In its North America retail operations, for instance, the company's gone back to making money. This time last year, the segment was operating at a loss of more than $1.5 billion in the three months leading up to March 31, 2022. This year, this segment reported operating income of $898 million.Another case in point: Last year, in Q1 2022, online stores sales declined 1% year-over-year.

GOOG,Investors are too bearish on tech: Analyst,"Key Video Highlights:00:04 - Earnings: clean sweep for big tech00:30 - There's no 'boogeyman' to take down techYou're seeing across the board a lot of these names just put up very clean numbers. And the fear factor is that there's a giant boogeyman in the closet. And it's going to take down tech again. And everyone's opening the closet, and there's a giant teddy bear giving you a big hug. That's the analysis.It is-- I've done this for a long time, and I've never seen how negative investors are in tech. And rightfully so, right? We saw a big contraction as it relates to overall. The sentiment last year in tech, and it was a hard year for all of us. But I think, ultimately, we just went to super overbearish. And again, great, great discipline on expense. You're seeing that now in earnings. They now have to demonstrate the next leg, which for the stock is really going to be the revenue reacceleration.And so that's going to reaccelerate to, you know, mid to high single digit growth in the back half of the year. But we'll want to hear more about, you know, what's going to happen in the back half here and how they can pump that up. The checks, you know, that we have with advertisers is that they have lapped the iOS changes. They are seeing better ROI in the Meta platform, Instagram, in particular. They are encouraged that Mark Zuckerberg has stayed out of the press. And that has helped for advertisers, because they don't have to ask questions from their clients, as you post a picture of him.So I think, ultimately, there's been many things that are going right. But I think the common theme here is, you know, tech is-- tech is strong, stronger than most people think. Yes, we're fading, but things are a lot better than the bears have been expecting.","April 26, 2023 at 4:41 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/investors-too-bearish-tech-analyst-214113322.html,Yahoo Finance Video,0.0,0.0,0.13206552706552707,0.44842287342287335,2023-04-26 16:41:00,2023-04-26 16:41:00,105.55999755859376,104.4499969482422,1.1100006103515625
GOOG,"Microsoft, Alphabet ramp up spending on AI as competition heats up","Yahoo Finance Live discusses the competition between Microsoft and Alphabet as the two companies ramp up their spending on AI development of search engine products.So on one hand, you have Microsoft and Satya Nadella sort of championing Search and their role that AI is playing in Search. They saw 10% growth in Search. And then, you have Alphabet and Sundar Pichai basically defending their stance in Search, at one point calling growth resilient. They saw 2% growth.Now obviously, when we think about Alphabet, when we think about Google, Search is still a major part of their business obviously, over half of their revenue.You heard them mention Bing several times yesterday. They said that Bing downloads have now 4X-ed over the last two months. And that mobile app, they didn't even mention Bing last year on that earnings call. So, a clear shift from Microsoft to say, hey, we want to talk about Bing, and we want to talk about Search. Because we're going to be a player here. And they're trying to come for Google in some ways.I did enjoy this quote from an executive, who said for every one point of share gain in the Search advertising market, it's a $2 billion revenue opportunity. So that gives you a sense that every little bit they gain on Google, massive revenue opportunity.But a lot of the focus was on AI. And another thing that Satya did add here, in terms of Bing, they said that the feedback that they're getting from the users that have adopted it so far has been very positive. So, they're encouraged by what they're hearing. I think it's a massive opportunity for Microsoft, and it's a big reason why the stock is up just about 20% year to date.","April 26, 2023 at 2:56 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/microsoft-alphabet-ramp-spending-ai-195608497.html,Yahoo Finance Video,0.0,0.0,0.0462594696969697,0.46827651515151514,2023-04-26 14:56:00,2023-04-26 14:56:00,105.55999755859376,104.4499969482422,1.1100006103515625
GOOG,"Big tech finding out AI is 'becoming this anticipated hype, something very important': Analyst","Ben Emons, NewEdge Wealth Senior Portfolio Manager and Head of Fixed Income and Macro, joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss the earnings reports from Microsoft and Alphabet, the impact of AI on Big Tech, and the decline in First Republic Bank's stock.We have Ben Emons, New Edge Wealth Senior Portfolio Manager. Good to see you. So a summer rip-- that is a new one for me. Sounds good unless you read it. Looks like RIP, which could go the other direction. What's ahead for big tech after what we saw yesterday from Microsoft and Google?And to some extent, what Google and Microsoft yesterday reported was that that is going to be an important part of their business going forward. So the jump in Microsoft, particularly, today was driven by their view that they are the leader in the artificial intelligence and they're taking a real step forward. So that, I think, is behind that rip, because Microsoft has a huge weight in the NASDAQ, over 12.5%. So you can expect somewhat more outperformance from here as more news comes out of artificial intelligence and how it affects tech earnings.That seems to be the biggest fear. And that is to be seen. It's been around for a really long time. It's just a matter of how it's implemented and what it does to what is a good thing, productivity. People point back to this latest episode of AI boosting these tech shares as in we're back in the '90s of technology is upgrading and, therefore, leading to a productivity boom.That's true, then that would actually be a really positive development for the economy. So it's a mixed picture. But I think your view that, yes, the government will be very careful here in terms of having AI implement that could then affect employment.But I think these companies are in a position here to still deliver topline growth. And in a weakening environment that we're dealing with, people pay up for growth. So can you get to higher multiples here? Yes, you can.But I also think that these stocks have at least longevity, because it does show these companies can weather economic change, especially as we're going through now, which we're seeming to move more and more closer towards this point of recession.Because as much as the Fed stepped in March, the regional bank index has not really recovered. And now, the rest of stock market did, but not the regional bank shares. And in addition that those bank shares are really more closely linked to what's happening on the ground in the economy, and if it is weakening and it's going to lead to less lending, then margins are going to continue to shrink.So I think it's an ongoing story. I don't want to draw necessarily parallel exactly to what happened during 2007-2008. But there's definitely a sign here of as regional banks continue to weaken, it does point you to an economy that continues to slip. And I think that's the bigger message for investors.What will be challenging here is that the FDIC, already having stepped up quite a bit for the other deposit holders at Signature Bank and Silicon Valley, took a big hit on an insurance fund. So there's some limits on what they may be able to do in order to help out, in this case, First Republic. So it's really up in the air what will happen here.It's interesting to note, though, that it didn't have the contagion effects today as it did yesterday. And that was really because of the revelation of the earnings from First Republic showing this huge decline in deposits. Markets have digested it. But I think it will continue to be a lingering risk hanging over the markets into the summer.","April 26, 2023 at 2:36 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/big-tech-finding-ai-becoming-193618079.html,Yahoo Finance Video,0.3233333333333333,0.65,0.16743006993006995,0.4649912587412587,2023-04-26 14:36:00,2023-04-26 14:36:00,105.55999755859376,104.4499969482422,1.1100006103515625
GOOG,Microsoft 'holding a lot of the cards' in AI-powered search war with Google,"“We look forward to continuing this journey in what is a generational shift in the largest software category, search,” Microsoft Chairman and CEO Satya Nadella said on the company’s earnings call Tuesday night.Microsoft flaunted 10% revenue growth in search, citing share gains for Bing and its Edge browser (a direct competitor to Google Chrome). Bing now has more than 100 million daily active users while daily installs of the Bing mobile app have grown four times since the launch of the AI powered version of the product two months ago.“It is a generational paradigm shift,"" Ted Mortonson, Baird technology strategist, told Yahoo Finance Live. ""I would say Microsoft is holding a lot of the cards right now.”Microsoft shares rose as much as 8.5% in intraday trading while Alphabet shares ticked slightly above the flat line in midday trading.A year ago, Microsoft didn’t mention Bing once on its earnings call. The search engine hasn’t been a growth driver for Microsoft in the past, at least not at the level that search drives the narrative for Alphabet, where “Google Search and other” accounts for more than half of the company’s revenue.Google, for its part, defended it’s long-standing search dominance throughout its call on Tuesday night, with CEO Sundar Pichai noting, “Obviously, in search, we have been using AI for a while.”Guggenheim analyst John DiFucci, who has a Sell rating on Microsoft, points out Bing’s growth as noteworthy. Bing’s growth in the quarter reversed a five-quarter downward trend, according to DiFucci.“Another line we’ve not focused on in the past, but probably should going forward is Bing,” DiFucci wrote in a note to clients. “We’d assume that if Microsoft can be an outsized beneficiary of generative AI (Chat GPT), it would show up in this line.”Among other catalysts, Microsoft's position in AI pushed DiFucci's price target on Microsoft up to $232 from $212.While ChatGPT has been seen as the consumer-facing leader in the AI arms race, Microsoft believes its ability to tie the new technology to its Azure platform could be crucial as well.Microsoft now has 10 times more Azure OpenAI service customers than last quarter, with more than 2,500 Azure OpenAI service customers, per the company’s earnings call. Azure and other cloud services revenue grew 27% in the third quarter compared to the same period a year prior. Citi estimates that AI could amount to one point of Azure’s growth in the next quarter.“(Microsoft) is almost kind of like the technology Death Star if you will,” Mortonson said. “Microsoft has incredible management that executes. In that respect, as you move into generative AI, they've been working with OpenAI for years and have a huge investment. It’s powered by Nvidia and sits on Azure.

GOOG,"Stocks move higher at the open as investors digest Microsoft, Alphabet earnings","Yahoo Finance Live’s Brad Smith breaks down how stocks are trading following the opening bell on Wednesday.Let's take a look at some of that sector activity. As we mentioned, it looks like some strong activity coming into the start of today's trade for technology. That's up by about 1.9% for that sector. At least of the 11 S&P 500 sectors, that is clearly far and away leading the pack right now. It's not even close. It's like Usain Bolt and me running after him. And XLY, consumer discretionary, that's up by about half and a percent. Then bringing up the caboose here, back to the pack, you've got health care, that's down by about 1% here. Let's also take a look at the tech heavy NASDAQ, since that was the biggest gainer here.Look at this move in Microsoft at the start of today's trade. You're seeing that higher by 7.3%, that on the back of the earnings and a positive call that they had last night. Also, interesting to track Alphabets move. And here's why, because intraday, at least out of the gate this morning, it's only up by about 2/10s of a percent. This was higher on the immediate reaction when the earnings dropped by about four-and-a-half percent and, ultimately, kind of withered away some of those gains as the call went on. And I believe, by the time the call was done, those shares were only higher by about one-and-a-quarter percent in extended trading.So here this morning, not seeing too much of a bid, it's up by about 2/10s of a percent. We'll see if it holds on to that. And no, it doesn't. It's down now by about 2/10s of a percent.

GOOG,"Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon are the leaders in a paradigm shift toward AI, strategist says","Baird Technology Strategist Ted Mortonson joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss quarterly earnings for Microsoft and Alphabet, cloud growth, the expectations for Amazon’s quarterly earnings, and the outlook for generative AI.When I looked at these numbers, and especially zeroed in on Alphabet's numbers particularly, it was noteworthy the growth that they saw in their cloud division, as well as the profitability, even at a time where we were talking about coming into this earnings season it being in an environment of more deals scrutiny. Interested in what you make of that and what this really kind of sets forth in terms of the growth narrative that these companies have really been pitching to the Street and to customers?If you look at Microsoft-- your previous guest summed it up well-- the previous quarter, they grew 38%, they guided to 31%, and they hit that number. And that was better than feared by the Street. They guided forward Azure growth at 26% to 27%. So you're seeing that moderation. This is all before you integrate generative AI so that's a positive.As it relates to Google, I would somewhat challenge the thought process that Google is behind. They pioneered AI with DeepMind. And they just rolled out Bard. They're holding a lot of cards here. And I think to some degree, the Street may be leaning one way. These are two brilliant companies with unbelievable managements.And generative AI is gonna affect every single industry for, you know, the next decade. It's probably one of the largest technology evolutions I've seen in my 30-year career of doing technology. And as an engineer, it is a feat, not only on the silicon side but on the software side.I think what happens tomorrow with Amazon is incredibly important for the tape. Last quarter, they grew 20%. The Street has a very negative bias on their channel checks on Amazon in relationship to AWS growth. And I think this is gonna be a very important report tomorrow.Also, the Street is very, very focused, not only on AWS growth rate, but for Amazon this is a major contributor to operating margin. AWS contributed almost $5.2 billion of profitability last quarter with operating margins of 24.3%. That engine's got to keep going to fuel the investment that Amazon is doing on their core ecommerce.Are we not going to see that same effect in AWS? Does AWS not have the same kind of bolt on services for cloud that the other players do? Or could they potentially surprise to the upside, also?And I think post-Silicon Valley's failure, that smaller component now on the private side is definitely seeing some pressure. Now, with that said, you look at these three clouds-- AWS, Azure, and GCP-- they are true monopolies. They're worldwide monopolies. Outside of China, Baidu, and Alibaba, they're holding 90-plus-percent of the AI engineers. And as you move into generative AI, these three companies are going to be the leaders in a paradigm shift-- not only in search but across all industries as software changes.And Microsoft is incredibly well-positioned because of their enterprise reach. And I think Dan summed it up very, very well where you're-- when you look at Microsoft, they're already commercializing AI with what's called Copilot. And Copilot's being commercialized on the developer with GitHub. It's being commercialized on security with their E5 offering. It's through dynamics.Microsoft is actually rolling it out to the enterprise right now and I think that's their core advantage, at least in the near term.Is that still the way of thinking? Are companies looking to piecemeal together a broader kind of cloud solution for themselves? Or are they kind of picking and choosing? And if so, is there a clear winner right now among some of the largest cloud players that you're tracking?And as you look at the roadmap, it is a scary roadmap. It's almost kind of like the technology Deskstar, if you will. Microsoft is an incredibly brilliant management that executes. And in that respect, I think as you move into generative AI-- they've been working with OpenAI for years in a huge investment. OpenAI is powered by NVIDIA, it sits on Azure.That's a pretty big initial advantage in this next war. And it is a generational paradigm. So I would say, Microsoft is holding a lot of cards right now.","April 26, 2023 at 8:34 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/microsoft-alphabet-amazon-leaders-paradigm-133457680.html,Yahoo Finance Video,0.0,0.0,0.1513862652499016,0.5455411255411253,2023-04-26 08:34:00,2023-04-26 08:34:00,105.55999755859376,104.4499969482422,1.1100006103515625
GOOG,"Microsoft, Alphabet ramp up search engine rivalry as both Big Tech companies report earnings","Yahoo Finance’s Daniel Howley joins the Live show to break down quarterly earnings for Microsoft and Alphabet.And then Activision Blizzard a spokesperson said, ""The CMA's report contradicts the ambitions of the UK to become an attractive country to build technology businesses. We will work aggressively with Microsoft to reverse this on appeal. The report's conclusions are a disservice to UK citizens who face increasingly dire economic prospects. We will assess our growth plan plans for the UK, global innovators large and small will take note that despite all its rhetoric the UK is clearly closed for business.""So really strong words there from both Microsoft and Activision Blizzard. And this deal-- this would have been the largest acquisition by Microsoft. The reason why they're doing this is twofold. They want call of duty. It's a huge franchise. Last Virgin made $1 billion days after its release. So that's a good amount of cash to be pulling in.And the other thing is this Still Nascent Cloud gaming market. And Microsoft right now is just beating the pants off of Sony, Nvidia, Nintendo's not even part of that conversation right now. They have their Xbox Cloud, the Xbox Game Pass with cloud offering. It's $14.99 a month.I have it. I love it. You get easy access to games. Look, if Microsoft is eventually able to get Call of Duty and other Activision Blizzard games it would be massive. The issue here and the FTC points this out, which is also suing to block this deal, they say that Microsoft had previously gone back on assurances that they would allow some games to be available to third parties like PlayStation when they acquired ZeniMax and their company Bethesda Softworks.There's a huge game coming out from them that was originally going to be on PlayStation. It's now not going to be on PlayStation, it's going to be an Xbox exclusive. And look, exclusives are really what matters here. If you're to sell consoles, people are going to do it based on what games they can get for them. The cloud kind of starts taking that away though. And Microsoft is aggressive as hell when it comes to the cloud. You get a Samsung TV? It's got Xbox Game Pass built in now.Bing is still not as good as Google as far as when I'm doing searching, but my vibe from the call was they took the gloves off and just cold cocked Google right there with that statement. Just like, look, we're coming for you. And you know, I think they said that what was it, every of market share they grab is $2 billion? So they're just-- if they could start chipping away at Google there then that's going to be how they do it.And Google, for its part is saying, oh yeah, we're going to add chat capabilities to search. It's coming. It's coming. We have Bard out there in test. But Microsoft is doing it, right? And that's the difference.And not only are they doing it with search with chat they're also adding it to their other services. So Google did that with their kind of workspace services, right, with Google Docs and sheets and all that. But Microsoft's adding it to cybersecurity. They're adding it to Dynamics 365. They're adding it to Microsoft 365. So it's across their stack right now that they're throwing this technology in.It makes them look like they are just crushing Google in a place that Google helped create. They're part of the reason why this transformative technology exists, right? So the fact that they're beating Microsoft, I mean, it's got to send shivers up the spines of the executives there and investors for Google.The economy is challenged right now. So Google already losing some momentum for that reason. But you have to wonder over the longer term, I mean, you tend to see ad trends shift over time. And so I wonder if search ads are going to be as important as a part of either of these companies businesses 10 years from now, for example.There was a rumor going around about that. And that would be huge. Samsung runs on Android. If you pull up search you're going to be using Google. So you know Samsung is one of the largest manufacturers of smartphones on Earth. If Microsoft can get Edge in there or Bing in there rather that would be massive for them.","April 26, 2023 at 8:21 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/microsoft-alphabet-ramp-search-engine-132109175.html,Yahoo Finance Video,0.0,0.1,0.15726138940424655,0.5689423388402978,2023-04-26 08:21:00,2023-04-26 08:21:00,105.55999755859376,104.4499969482422,1.1100006103515625

GOOG,Microsoft earnings: CEO Satya Nadella encouraged by Bing users' feedback on A.I.,"The demand for AI products remains strong, and Microsoft has surpassed 300 million monthly active users for Teams, with market share gains in all categories, said Seana Smith. Microsoft's CEO Satya Nadella believes the company is ready to lead the AI platform wave and make the necessary investments to stay ahead of the competition.Watch the video to hear Brad Smith's take on Alphabet.Key video moments:00:00:22 - Microsoft and Alphabet stocks' after hours moves00:01:39 - Microsoft's key takeaways00:04:12 - Alphabet's key takeaways00:06:51 - Brad and Seana's vibe check00:08:35 - Wall st. vs. Main st.[AUDIO LOGO]And you're seeing actually both of them highlighted here underneath of that end of day move. Intraday moved lower by about 2% to 4%. But in the after hours after these reports drop and even throughout the course of these earnings calls, you see Microsoft hold onto gains by about 8.8%. And then pivoting on over to Google or Alphabet, you're seeing those shares hold onto gains, but down off of some of the move higher that we had seen to the tune of about 4% earlier in that immediate reaction. But Seana, we've got to start with Microsoft here this afternoon.And it really met what the Street was looking for, that buzzword ""AI"" and how Microsoft is incorporating it into their business. It's what people wanted to hear. Satya Nadella, the executives at Microsoft really delivering on that. And it comes back to the excitement, what its fueled, Microsoft, since the start of the year. So let's get to my big takeaways.First up is the demand for AI products. They remain strong right now, at least that's according to Microsoft. They're very pleased with the engagement, the interest that they are seeing from their customers and the feedback that they are getting so far.Second up, we had the Teams usage. Now, this is something that we don't talk about as much. Because maybe it's not as sexy to talk about when we're talking about everything with Microsoft and AI and the progress that they made there.But a pretty impressive number that they put forward. Microsoft surpassing 300 million monthly active users for Teams. So an impressive milestone there for the company. And Satya saying that Microsoft continues to take market share across all of those categories.And then bringing it back to AI and the growth there, Bing. Bing continuing to take share here in the US. We had Satya is saying that they were very encouraged by the feedback that they are hearing from Bing users that Microsoft is going to continue to keep incorporating their AI capabilities. So, certainly, it's all about the AI race. That's really what has been fueling some of this tech rally that we've seen so far this year.And Satya, Brad, he did not hold back. He went after the leader, I should say, by a wide margin in search right now, Google, Alphabet. Let's take a listen to what exactly Satya had to say about that.However, I do want to pivot and get to some of the takeaways here. And what I ultimately got from the Google, the Alphabet call-- Alphabet, Google, whatever you're calling them at home. There were a few things that really stuck out to me.Number one, if we can get to these takeaways, first and foremost, it's the AI-driven opportunities in search that they're talking about here. And that's what I'm going to weave into this second point there as they're talking about the future being kind of artificial intelligence as a service. And here's specifically what they said.How different language learning models are being layered into cloud, how they're being layered into cybersecurity and workspaces, even. And so they're really kind of painting this picture of a future for a developer angle where other companies can leverage the language-learning models that they are able to build out and then sell those or license those out, similar to some of the other services that they do have as well.They talked about a year of sharpened focus. I kind of gave that a hat tip to Mark Zuckerberg or Meta Platforms, a year of efficiency. And what that sharpened focus looks like, you can imagine cost restructuring. We already heard about some of that. And even with that sharpened focus, where the growth narrative is actually pointing right now.And they spent a little bit of the time talking about cloud here and particularly where AI layered into the cloud, but also just the growth of cloud. And so that was one of the more positive sparks as that cloud business became profitable. And a lot of analysts really latching on to that particularly here.And then they talked a lot about YouTube, YouTube Shorts too. I mean, my goodness. Breaking this down in two different measures here, YouTube, they talked about the content creation and AI and how that can be layered in for creators in the future. They talked about the NFL Sunday Ticket pricing.OK, great. You're trying to get some sports viewership. Understood. And that's really where they're looking to kind of link together the living room and really competing for that living room viewership from their end users and subscribers.But here's where it got interesting and I wanted to bring this full circle on the Shorts front as well. They talked about this strong creator momentum here, saying that daily uploads, they actually rose, by channel, 80% over the course of this past year. So that is something that they were asked a little bit more about later on the call, getting some questions about monetization trends, but really only offering up that they're seeing engaging and conversion on ads across their Shorts.So that's something worth keeping an eye on. Also worth noting that the revenue for this quarter for YouTube, it actually declined year over year. So perhaps TikTok is taking a little bit of that market share. We know that the in-app purchase is huge for advertisers to really make sure that they're being able to take advantage of it as well right here. Let's also check in on some of these vibes. I've got to know, what was your vibe from this call, Seana?And they're really looking to lead this AI race. And I think that gives them a huge advantage. What about you, Brad?Because they're still waiting for some of the bets to really be monetized. On the long-term basis, we're going to see exactly how that is layered into their existing search engine, how that's layered into content creation on YouTube, and how they're able to benefit from some partnerships that they've drummed up. One of those partnerships, such partnerships is NVIDIA. Interesting to see there. And I was tracking shares of NVIDIA as well after earnings dropped for these companies and after the call started.And I mentioned on the Alphabet earnings call, you saw NVIDIA shares actually higher in after hours trading. Right now, they're higher by about 2.7% in extended hours. Taking a look at that chart. And the mention that I'm noting here, they're the only cloud provider-- Google is the only cloud provider to announce the availability of NVIDIA L4 tensor core GPUs for inference AI workloads. So that particularly benefiting NVIDIA at least here and now, as Luther Vandross would say.But we've got to keep it moving, keep it rolling along here. Let's bring in Yahoo Finance's tech editor Dan Howley to get his take on what took place between both of these calls. Dan had kind of one headphone in for Microsoft, one headphone in for Alphabet. Dan, what did you gather?And they actually had fallen back pretty significantly from when they initially announced. You know, a lot of AI talk on Microsoft's side. Google really, I think that the big thing is their continued to improvements rather at ad sales space. And, you know, sure, they're going to have to talk about AI as well.But it just still feels really like Microsoft is continuing to dominate this conversation as far as AI goes. And, you know, I just want to go real quick to what we're seeing from folks on Twitter as far as the AI aspect goes. We asked some of our readers, who is winning the race so far? And 56% so far say Microsoft.There's much more after the call to roll on. Over the course of this week, we've got more of those companies in this beloved tech landscape reporting.

AAPL,Why Montana's TikTok ban faces massive challenges,"Montana on Wednesday became the first state in the country to ban TikTok. But experts say you shouldn’t expect the measure to survive challenges in the courts.“The ban is a dramatic and unconstitutional incursion on the First Amendment rights of Montanans,” Ramya Krishnan, staff attorney at the Knight First Amendment Institute and a lecturer in law at Columbia Law School, told Yahoo Finance. “To justify the ban, Montana would have to show that it's necessary to prevent actual harms. And it hasn't done this.”In a statement after signing the bill, Gov. Greg Gianforte said the Chinese Communist Party is using TikTok to “spy on Americans, violate their privacy, and collect personal, private, and sensitive information.”The broader problem for Montana’s law, experts say, is that it’s simply too broad.“The legal hurdle is the First Amendment,” David Greene, civil liberties director and senior staff attorney for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, explained via email. “This law, as a restriction on the way Montanans speak and receive speech, will need to be justified by the state as an appropriately narrow and effective way of protecting Montanans’ personal data. That will be very difficult to do.”The US has long accused TikTok of collecting data on Americans and feeding it to the Chinese government. Reasons include, potentially, building a database on American users, storing data to blackmail citizens, or trying to spread disinformation online.The main fear is that China can use its national intelligence law to force TikTok parent company ByteDance to turn over any data on American users to the Chinese government. TikTok, however, has said it has never shared information with the Chinese government.Neither the US government nor Montana has provided concrete evidence that China is siphoning American user data from TikTok. And that’s a major problem for the new law. “Speculative harms can't justify a total ban on a communications platform, let alone one that is used by...Americans in the state of Montana,” said Krishnan.Even enforcing the ban could prove problematic for Montana. If the state chooses to determine residents’ locations based on their internet protocol addresses, they could accidentally block citizens of bordering states from downloading TikTok, as well. Montanans could also use virtual private networks to mask their location and download the app anyway.Rather than outright banning TikTok, experts say the best way to address concerns that the company is harvesting Americans’ data is through a national data privacy law. Congress has discussed the topic for years without passing any legislation.“First look at passing a federal privacy law…to ensure that there are specific limits and rules for the road of how any online service, TikTok included, can collect and use and share people's personal information,” Emma Llansó, director of the Center for Democracy and Technology's Free Expression Project told Yahoo Finance.“That would be an enormous step forward for people's privacy, and would not require banning any apps whatsoever.”According to Llansó, the government could also put restrictions on how data brokers in the US share Americans’ information.“They could put limits on that or put a stop to that, and that would be a much more meaningful way to protect the safety and security of people's data from foreign government surveillance,” she explained.Regardless, we won’t have to wait long to find out how Montana’s ban will fare in the courts. According to Reuters, a group of five Montana TikTok users are already suing the state to block the ban.The clock is ticking.Find live stock market quotes and the latest business and finance news","May 19, 2023 at 1:28 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-montanas-tiktok-ban-faces-massive-challenges-182836790.html,Yahoo Finance,0.0,1.0,0.0990447957839262,0.40813452851496335,2023-05-19 13:28:00,2023-05-19 13:28:00,176.38999938964844,175.16000366210938,1.2299957275390625
AAPL,Google and Samsung are wasting a golden opportunity with their foldable phones,"Big slabs of glass on the front, chunky camera systems on the back. Smartphones have generally revolved around the same basic design since their inception.The closest approximation to a next-generation phone design is the foldable phone: a device that behaves like a normal smartphone and fits in your pocket, but opens like a book to reveal a bigger display when you need it.It's an obvious advance in form and and function. Unfortunately, foldable phones are simply not attainable for most people.It’s not their designs, or their performance. The one major aspect holding back foldable phones is their price.The first major foldable smartphone on the scene, Galaxy Fold was priced around $2,000 back in 2019, and unfortunately, not much has changed.Samsung’s latest foldable, the Galaxy Z Fold 4, costs $1,800. Google’s Pixel Fold unveiled last week? Also $1,800. To be clear, $1,800 is rent or mortgage for a lot of people.Why companies aren’t pricing foldables lower is hard to know. Perhaps the components necessary to make foldable phones are still limited. If that’s the case, then lowering the price could be counterproductive, since there would not be enough supply to meet the demand.Keeping foldable phones in the premium tier could also be important for any number of strategic corporate reasons. But when you consider the history of smartphones, and how they succeeded when they became more affordable, it’s clear that if Google, Samsung, or others want their foldables to win, or at least become widely-used, there’s one simple solution: Lower the price.","May 19, 2023 at 1:20 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/google-samsung-wasting-golden-opportunity-182025144.html,Fortune,0.3,0.5,0.07135176651305684,0.40211213517665134,2023-05-19 13:20:00,2023-05-19 13:20:00,176.38999938964844,175.16000366210938,1.2299957275390625

AAPL,Could Montana's TikTok ban violate free speech rights?,"Yahoo Finance tech editor Dan Howley breaks down Montana's TikTok ban, if the ban violates free speech rights, and the technical challenges related to the ban.Excuse me. Experts that I spoke to basically said that blocking the app entirely would violate Montanans' First Amendment rights to free speech. And essentially, they say that that's because they're seeking a broad means without trying to first go ahead and provide a narrower means of attacking this problem that they say exists, the idea that China is siphoning American user data from TikTok.Now, the experts that I spoke to said that a more clear response than just banning TikTok outright would be to set up some kind of national privacy data legislation. So that's something that would be narrower. It wouldn't include banning an app that 150 million Americans use. And it would still allow Google and Apple to provide the app. It would just limit the means for apps, including TikTok rivals like Meta and Twitter, from collecting user data.Now, that's the First Amendment side of things. Then there's the technical side of things. Basically, this is something that banning an app in an entire state, but a specific state is difficult to do. Now, they could say, OK, your IP address, your internet protocol address, which is basically your address for when you're online telling where you are, could be used as a means for kind of geolocation or your GPS signal. But the problem is that if you are near the border, for instance, of Montana, other states, residents in other states, could be impacted. So they wouldn't be able to download TikTok as well.The other issue is people could just set up a VPN and then say that they're in-- I don't know-- Venezuela and download TikTok within Montana. So there's no surefire way of this actually seeming to work. The other problem is Apple and Google would be on the hook. It would be $10,000 per violation. So any time a person downloads TikTok, once this goes into effect, Apple and Google would have to pay $10,000, and then an additional $10,000 for each day the violation continues. So they could rack up millions of dollars in fines here because of the app itself.Now, overall, it doesn't seem like this is going to hold water under scrutiny. There's already a lawsuit being filed by some residents in Montana who are seeking to nullify this law. It really does seem as though it's going to be something that falls to the wayside rather quickly if it's challenged in courts. At least, that's according to these First Amendment experts that I spoke to.","May 19, 2023 at 10:55 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/could-montanas-tiktok-ban-violate-155524652.html,Yahoo Finance Video,0.4,0.8,0.11637205387205389,0.41569865319865323,2023-05-19 10:55:00,2023-05-19 10:55:00,176.38999938964844,175.16000366210938,1.2299957275390625

AAPL,Explainer-How Montana could enforce a TikTok ban,"(Reuters) - Montana took the unusual step on Wednesday of banning Chinese-owned short video app TikTok, with lawmakers of the sparsely populated western U.S. state saying they aimed to protect residents from alleged intelligence gathering by China.TikTok, which is wildly popular with American teens and owned by Chinese tech company ByteDance, is already banned on government-issued devices in around 30 U.S. states and for employees of the country's federal agencies.While blocking apps by geography is not unheard of, the Montana law is notable for doing so at the state level, upending a single-market approach Apple and Alphabet's Google have long been able to use for their U.S. app stores.Montana's ban is set to take effect on Jan. 1 2024.HAS THIS EVER BEEN DONE BEFORE?Sort of.Tech companies are now well-practiced in blocking apps at the country level, mostly to comply with U.S. sanctions or for business purposes, like Apple's blocking of messaging and privacy apps in China upon government request.Enterprising young people in affected countries have an equally long track record of skirting the bans by downloading the apps while traveling internationally or using tools like virtual private networks (VPNs), which obscure their location.Within the United States, Pornhub recently disabled its services for IP addresses in Utah ahead of a state law that came into effect requiring adult content platforms to verify users' ages. However, that involved a website only, not an app.Specifically for apps, Google and Apple appear to have navigated a tangle of different U.S. state rules around online gambling by leaving compliance to individual app developers, according to their app store guidance.Google only started allowing gambling apps in its U.S. app store as of 2021, prior to which it restricted the apps in all but four countries: Brazil, France, Ireland and the United Kingdom.Apple and Google declined to comment on how they approach state rules on gambling.IS A STATE-LEVEL BAN EVEN TECHNICALLY FEASIBLE?While TikTok can theoretically block IP addresses registered in Montana, app stores will have a more difficult time.Apple and Google declined comment on the technical aspects of implementing a ban, but TechNet, a trade group funded by both companies, told Montana lawmakers in March that app stores ""do not have the ability to geofence on a state-by-state basis.""""It would thus be impossible for our members to prevent the app from being downloaded specifically in the state of Montana,"" the TechNet representative testified.According to cybersecurity researchers, that is likely because companies organize their app stores at the country level, meaning they have systems for shutting off downloads of a given app in some countries while keeping it accessible elsewhere.The companies do not appear to have built such controls at a more granular level, the researchers said.""I think it's possible but it's not possible today. It would require a bunch of code to be written,"" Alex Stamos, the director of the Stanford Internet Observatory and former top security officer at Facebook, said in a recent podcast.The app stores also would need to monitor more detailed location data from users' phones than they currently use, infringing on users' privacy, Stamos said.Even if the companies were to make those changes, TikTok-obsessed teens in Montana are likely to follow their peers around the world in learning how to use privacy tools and road trips to get the app onto their phones, said another researcher, John Scott-Railton at Citizen Lab.""The youth of Montana are about to become America's experts in VPNs,"" Railton said.(Reporting by Katie Paul; Editing by Kenneth Li and Anna Driver)","May 18, 2023 at 4:53 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/explainer-montana-could-enforce-tiktok-215332335.html,Reuters,0.0,0.0,0.09044715447154472,0.47987804878048773,2023-05-18 16:53:00,2023-05-18 16:53:00,173.0,175.0500030517578,-2.0500030517578125
AAPL,10 Stocks to Sell in 2023 According to Billionaire Steve Cohen,"Cohen expressed his belief that the emerging field of artificial intelligence will likely generate new employment opportunities. Although he expressed concerns about the potential displacement of certain jobs, he anticipates that overall profit margins will improve. This improvement would alleviate the need for the Federal Reserve to implement further interest rate hikes as a measure to control inflation. As a result, Cohen expects that such a scenario would positively impact the markets and contribute to their growth. Steve Cohen said he is “actually pretty bullish”. Our Methodology For this list, we selected the most popular stocks removed from billionaire Steve Cohen’s 13F portfolio during the first quarter of 2023. Cohen's fund sold its entire stakes in these companies in the March quarter. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders in each firm as of Q4 2022. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 46Albemarle Corporation (NYSE:ALB) specializes in the development, production, and distribution of specialized chemicals for various industries. The company is divided into three main segments - Lithium, Bromine, and Catalysts. In Q4 2022, Steve Cohen owned 64,962 shares of Albemarle Corporation (NYSE:ALB), worth $14 million. In Q1 2023, the billionaire disposed of his entire stake in the company. He also discarded his stakes in Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL).On May 11, KeyBanc last night upgraded Albemarle Corporation (NYSE:ALB) to Overweight from Sector Weight with a $270 price target. The analyst believes that the risk/reward ratio for lithium has improved following the company's recent earnings report. They anticipate an upturn in demand for lithium in China, which has been experiencing a downturn since November 2022. According to channel checks conducted within the Chinese lithium industry, inventories at the battery cell and electric vehicle levels are declining and expected to reach a low point in the next few months. The analyst suggests that this could lead to a resumption of purchase orders from major buyers in the near future.Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 54Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) operates a platform that allows hosts worldwide to offer accommodations and experiences to guests. Using a marketplace model, the company's platform enables hosts and guests to connect and book spaces and experiences online or through mobile devices. In Q4 2022, Cohen owned 314,926 shares of Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) worth nearly $27 million, which he sold in the first quarter of 2023. On May 9, Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) reported a Q1 GAAP EPS of $0.18 and a revenue of $1.82 billion, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.08 and $30 million, respectively. During the first quarter, the total number of active listings increased by 18% compared to the same period in the previous year. This growth rate was higher than the 16% recorded in the fourth quarter of 2022.RBC Capital analyst Brad Erickson lowered the firm's price target on Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) on May 10 to $105 from $135 and kept a Sector Perform rating on the shares. Although the company's Q1 earnings exceeded expectations, the management's guidance for Q2 Nights fell well below the consensus. Erickson anticipates that there will be greater pressure on the marginal Average Daily Rate in the future. Due to the company's high valuation and a clearer understanding of the structural limits on room night growth, RBC prefers to wait for a more significant pullback before recommending a more positive stance on Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB)’s stock.“Top contributors to performance for the quarter included online travel marketplace Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB). Airbnb outperformed on the resilience of the travel category including for long-term stays, and on operating leverage as cost optimization is met with revenue increases. Notably, our top four holdings entering the quarter (Sea, Meli, Nvidia, Airbnb) which represented 24.37% of capital on December 31, 2022, increased an average of 64.42% during the quarter.”Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 70PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) has been distributing cash dividends every quarter since 1965, and the year 2023 signifies the 51st consecutive year in which the company has raised its annual dividend, making it a dividend king. On May 2, PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) declared a $1.265 per share quarterly dividend, a 10% increase from its prior dividend of $1.150. The dividend is payable on June 30, to shareholders of record as of June 2. Although PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) has a strong history of paying dividends, Steve Cohen sold all of his shares in the company during the first quarter of 2023, worth approximately $80 million as of Q4 2022. On April 27, Barclays raised the firm's price target on PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) to $206 from $201 and maintained an Overweight rating on the shares. According to the analyst, the company increased its organic sales and core profit growth projections after its Q1 earnings report.“PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) announced that it will commit $3.3 million in funds toward water replenishment projects across North America. These projects aim to reduce absolute water use and replenish back into the local watershed more than 100% of the water used at company-owned and third-party sites in high water-risk areas.”Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 70Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) develops solutions that empower merchants to receive payments via card and also offer reporting and analysis features, as well as prompt settlement on the following day. The company increased its projections for 2023 and reported Q1 earnings that surpassed expectations. In the fourth quarter of 2022, Cohen held 587,303 shares of the company worth $37 million. However, during the first quarter of 2023, the billionaire sold all of his shares in Block, Inc. (NYSE: SQ). On May 11, CLSA analyst John Marrin downgraded Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) to Underperform from Buy with a price target of $63, down from $93, and expressed concerns about the macro environment that outweigh the firm's optimism about the company's long-term growth potential. The analyst believes that there is a growing likelihood of a ""hard landing"" in the U.S. during the latter half of 2023, as regional banks' withdrawal puts more pressure on consumers and small businesses, who are already struggling with high interest rates. Despite posting decent earnings last week, Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ)’s stock performance has trailed the market, and investors may already be anticipating lower earnings in 2024, the analyst wrote in the research note.“Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) provides point-of-sale technology to small businesses and operates the Cash App ecosystem of financial services for individuals. Shares fell due to mixed quarterly results with more modest growth in the Seller business offsetting strength in Cash App. While integration of recently acquired Afterpay is progressing well and credit metrics remain healthy, the buy-now-pay-later business slowed due to greater competitive intensity. We continue to own the stock due to Block’s long runway for growth, sustainable competitive advantages, and unique corporate culture.”Given this cash-generation power, we are naturally drawn to what we believe are strong and profitable financial institutions when the price is right. Presently, we believe the valuations of our financial holdings are not only reasonable, but extremely compelling, and our portfolio composition reflects this view. Representative financial holdings in the Fund include Wells Fargo.”Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 83Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) offers online reservation services for travel and restaurants worldwide. These services include accommodation reservations through Booking.com, rental car reservations through Rentalcars.com, travel reservation services, hotel distribution services, and vacation packages and cruises through Priceline, as well as flight, ground transportation, and activities reservation services through Agoda. The company also operates KAYAK, an online meta-search service, and OpenTable for booking online restaurant reservations. In Q4 2022, Cohen owned 66,448 shares of Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG), worth $134 million. In the first quarter of 2023, he dumped his stake entirely. On May 4, Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) reported a Q1 non-GAAP EPS of $11.60 and a revenue of $3.78 billion, outperforming Wall Street consensus by $0.86 and $30 million, respectively. Revenue for the period climbed 40% on a year-over-year basis. Deutsche Bank raised the firm's price target on Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) on May 8 to $3,000 from $2,910 and maintained a Buy rating on the shares following the Q1 results.“We did have several strong performing stocks this quarter. Our top contributors to return included NVR, Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft and Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG), all of which posted double-digit gains.Online travel services provider Booking Holdings reported strong results in the quarter with gross bookings well above pre-pandemic levels. In addition, the outlook for consumer travel continued to be relatively strong. We exited our position in Booking as its share price approached our estimate of intrinsic value, reallocating funds to more deeply discounted opportunities.”  Suggested articles:10 Best Diversified Bank Stocks to Buy NowWarren Buffett’s $5.7 Billion Dividend Portfolio: Top 15 PicksMilitary Spending by Country in 2023: 20 Largest Defense Budgets ","May 18, 2023 at 2:34 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-stocks-sell-2023-according-193432788.html,Insider Monkey,0.0,0.0,0.11870580808080808,0.39626198622166364,2023-05-18 14:34:00,2023-05-18 14:34:00,173.0,175.0500030517578,-2.0500030517578125

AAPL,Apple slashes sales estimates of its headset - Bloomberg News,"(Reuters) - Apple Inc has lowered sales estimates for its long-awaited mixed-reality headsets by about two-thirds, Bloomberg News reported on Thursday, citing people familiar with the matter.The iPhone-maker had initially hoped to sell about 3 million units a year, but has now pared back those estimates to about 1 million, and then to 900,000 units, the report said.The company is set to hold a developers' conference on June 5, where it is expected to present the product, the report said.Apple did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.The mixed-reality headset, which can overlay digital objects on a view of the real world, is widely anticipated to be Apple's next major product.The headset is expected to cost around $3,000, Bloomberg News had reported in February.

AAPL,"At US$173, Is It Time To Put Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) On Your Watch List?"," See our latest analysis for Apple The share price seems sensible at the moment according to my price multiple model, where I compare the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average. I’ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there’s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock’s ratio of 28.8x is currently trading slightly above its industry peers’ ratio of 25.23x, which means if you buy Apple today, you’d be paying a relatively reasonable price for it. And if you believe that Apple should be trading at this level in the long run, then there should only be a fairly immaterial downside vs other industry peers. Although, there may be an opportunity to buy in the future. This is because Apple’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company’s shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to grow by a double-digit 18% over the next couple of years, the outlook is positive for Apple. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.","May 18, 2023 at 8:00 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-173-time-put-apple-130014360.html,Simply Wall St.,0.0,0.0,0.1283542319749216,0.5008777429467085,2023-05-18 08:00:00,2023-05-18 08:00:00,173.0,175.0500030517578,-2.0500030517578125

Nvidia, one of the biggest beneficiaries of AI-related demand, Dutch semiconductor firm ASML Holding NV and Microsoft Corp. rank among the fund’s biggest holdings.While Osmani is overweight the tech sector as a whole, he’s notably staying away from Apple, Alphabet, Facebook-owner Meta and Netflix Inc. as they’re more directly exposed to the consumer, the fund manager said in an interview in London. They also score poorly on the fund’s fundamental metrics scale, which includes themes such as infrastructure, green and alternative energy and electric transportation.“Tech is still attractive as we think the Federal Reserve is done hiking rates, although we don’t expect rate cuts,” Osmani said. “But you have to look at it through different segments rather than invest across Big Tech.”The fund manager is among a chorus of market participants bullish on AI-related stocks. An analysis by Societe Generale SA strategists found that, without the hype around AI, the S&P 500 index would be lower this year instead of having gained 8%. The team at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said AI-related shares now offer the biggest potential long-term support for US profit margins.Banks UnattractiveOsmani is also staying away from banks globally, despite cheaper valuations. The sudden collapse of a slate of US regional banks since March has roiled the sector and prompted investors to slash allocation to financials at a pace not seen since before the global financial crisis, according to Bank of America Corp.’s latest global fund manager survey.“Banking is an industry that has high competitive pressures, diminishing barriers to entry, low pricing power and is facing a higher risk of disruption,” Osmani said. “All of which leads us to believe that the industry dynamics aren’t attractive.”--With assistance from Ksenia Galouchko.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekApple’s New Headset Meets RealitySweetgreen Tests Robots to Make Faster, More Efficient Sad Desk SaladsThe True Cost of an Extended US Debt-Ceiling StandoffRecession Calls Keep Getting Pushed Back, Giving Soft Landing Believers HopePeyton Manning’s Omaha Productions Becomes a Media Powerhouse©2023 Bloomberg L.P.","May 18, 2023 at 7:36 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-performing-fund-manager-bets-123603651.html,Bloomberg,0.0,0.0,0.11920255183413077,0.4674003189792664,2023-05-18 07:36:00,2023-05-18 07:36:00,173.0,175.0500030517578,-2.0500030517578125

AAPL,Montana governor bans TikTok. But can the state enforce the law?,"Montana Republican Gov. Greg Gianforte signed it into law Wednesday expecting a legal fight would follow. The law, which isn't scheduled to take effect until Jan. 1, 2024, also faces a litany of questions over whether the state can even enforce the law.The new rules in Montana will have more far-reaching effects than TikTok bans already in place on government-issued devices in nearly half the states and the U.S. federal government. There are 200,000 TikTok users in Montana as well as 6,000 businesses that use the video-sharing platform, according to company spokesperson Jamal Brown.Here’s what you need to know:WHY IS MONTANA BANNING TIKTOK?Proponents of the law in Montana claim the Chinese government could harvest U.S. user data from TikTok and use the platform to push pro-Beijing misinformation or messages to the public.Critics have pointed to China’s 2017 national intelligence law that compels companies to cooperate with the country’s governments for state intelligence work. Another Chinese law, implemented in 2014, has similar mandates.TikTok says it has never been asked to hand over its data, and it wouldn’t do so if asked.WHAT DO THEY ARGUE IN THE LEGAL CHALLENGE?Five plaintiffs who are all TikTok creators from Montana argue the law is an unconstitutional violation of free speech rights. They also contend the state doesn’t have authority over matters of national security.“Montana can no more ban its residents from viewing or posting to TikTok than it could ban the Wall Street Journal because of who owns it or the ideas it publishes,” the complaint said.The people suing include one with a swimwear business, one who connects with military veterans, one who shares videos about ranch life, another who shares her outdoor adventures and one who shares humorous videos.Emily Flower, spokeswoman for the Montana Department of Justice, said the state expected a legal challenge and it is “fully prepared to defend the law.”TikTok has argued that the law infringes on people’s First Amendment rights. But spokesperson Brooke Oberwetter declined to comment on the lawsuit and also declined to say whether the company helped coordinate the complaint filed by the TikTok content creators.The case could serve as a testing ground for the TikTok free America many national lawmakers have envisioned.HOW DOES MONTANA PLAN TO BAN TIKTOK?The law will prohibit downloads of TikTok in the state and fine any “entity” — an app store or TikTok — $10,000 per day for each time someone accesses TikTok, “is offered the ability” to access it, or downloads it.That means Apple and Google, which operate app stores on Apple and Android devices, would be liable for any violations. Penalties would not apply to users.The statewide ban won't take effect until January 2024. It would be void if the social media platform is sold to a company that is not based in ""any country designated as a foreign adversary” by the federal government.Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen has pointed to technology used to restrict online sports gambling apps as a way to curtail TikTok from operating in the state. Those violations can be reported by anyone. And once the state verifies a breach has taken place, it sends a cease-and-desist letter to the company involved, said Kyler Nerison, a spokesperson for Knudsen's office. He said different companies use different methods for compliance and it's up to them “to not allow their apps to work in Montana and other states where they are not legal.”SO, COULD THE TIKTOK BAN WORK?Cybersecurity experts say that, other than avoiding the fine, there's nothing incentivizing the companies involved to comply and it will be extremely difficult — if not impossible — to adequately enforce the law.Before the Montana law passed, lawmakers rewrote portions of the bill to let them off the hook after a lobbyist for AT&T said during a February hearing the legislation was “not workable” to put into effect.COULD TECH COMPANIES BLOCK IT?Apple and Google have not spoken out against the law. But a representative for TechNet, the trade group that counts the two tech giants as its members, has said app stores don’t have the ability to “geofence” apps in different states and it would be impossible to prevent TikTok from being downloaded in Montana. The group has also said the responsibility should be on an app to determine where it can operate, not an app store.Telecoms analyst Roger Entner, of Recon Analytics, says he believes the app stores could have the capability to enforce the law, but it would be cumbersome to implement and full of loopholes. Apple and Google’s address-linked billing could be bypassed with prepaid cards and IP geolocation easily masked by using a VPN service, which can alter IP addresses and allows users to evade content restrictions, said mobile security expert Will Strafach, the founder of Guardian, which makes a privacy protection app for Apple devices.Oded Vanunu, head of products vulnerability research at the cybersecurity firm Check Point, agreed it would be difficult for app stores to isolate a single state from downloading an app. He suggested it would be more feasible for TikTok to comply since it controls the software and can “adjust the settings based on the geographical location or IP addresses"" of users.COULD TIKTOK BLOCK ITSELF?When users allow TikTok to collect their location information, it can track a person to at least 3 square kilometers (1.16 square miles) from their actual location. If that feature is disabled, TikTok can still collect approximate location information - such as the region, city or zip code in which a user may be located - based on device or network information, like an IP address.But similar to the app stores, cybersecurity experts note that any enforcement measures the company implements could be easily bypassed with a VPN and efforts to use IP geolocating might lead to other issues.David Choffnes, the executive director of the Cybersecurity and Privacy Institute at Northeastern University, said cell providers may use the same types of IP addresses for multiple states, which could mean someone who is not in Montana could incorrectly be blocked from using TikTok.___AP Technology Writer Frank Bajak contributed to this report from Boston.","May 17, 2023 at 6:19 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/montana-governor-bans-tiktok-state-231928488.html,AP Finance,0.0,0.0,0.029213494838494836,0.44323072760572757,2023-05-17 18:19:00,2023-05-17 18:19:00,171.7100067138672,172.69000244140625,-0.9799957275390625

New Delhi wants to bring more tech production to India after China’s trade war with the US and its strict Covid policies prompted companies to weigh other options.Apple has yet to begin making iPads or MacBook laptops in India, but fresh incentives could push the Cupertino, California-based company to consider such moves.

Local sourcing of components will help manufacturers win more financial benefits.In 2021, India launched a program worth 73.5 billion rupees to ramp up local manufacturing and build exports of IT products such as laptops, tablets and personal computers, but that effort failed to attract companies due to perceptions the incentives were too small.Chinese manufacturers such as Lenovo Group Ltd. could find it difficult to win incentives amid a frosty relationship with India since a Himalayan border clash in 2020.(Updates with minister’s comment in fourth paragraph)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekApple’s New Headset Meets RealityJapan’s New Military Might Is Rising in a Factory in HiroshimaESG Investing Goes Quiet After Blistering Republican AttacksThe True Cost of an Extended US Debt-Ceiling StandoffSweetgreen Tests Robots to Make Faster, More Efficient Sad Desk Salads©2023 Bloomberg L.P.","May 17, 2023 at 9:10 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/india-launches-2-billion-drive-100523416.html,Bloomberg,0.0,0.0,0.07724747474747476,0.3310101010101011,2023-05-17 09:10:00,2023-05-17 09:10:00,171.7100067138672,172.69000244140625,-0.9799957275390625

The vision for these new devices, and Alexa at-large, is that Amazon can offer Alexa as an approachable, ""personal AI,"" said Rohit Prasad, Alexa's head scientist, who emphasized safety right-off-the-bat.""Of course, Alexa should do anything and everything for you, within the bounds of safety norms,"" he told Yahoo Finance. ""Trust is absolutely critical and especially in these times, it's super important that we are all being responsible about how it's being used ... I think we have to constantly be very clear about what Alexa can and cannot do, or will or will not do. I think those points are becoming even more important, and we have the durable tenet of trust being paramount.""There's also some notable international expansion, as the Echo Auto, an Alexa device for cars, will also now be available in eight new countries, including the U.K., Germany, and Japan.""The entire smart home industry is a multi-billion-dollar industry that was created with Alexa,"" said Prasad. ""If you think about entertainment, Amazon Music has been growing at an incredible rate because of Alexa, so that's a huge data point. People also don't realize that a lot of shopping happens through Alexa. Shopping attractions are growing 40% year-over-year, and more than 50% of our customers have used Alexa for a shopping attraction. Lastly, even with things that are relatively new in terms of overall capability, Alexa is a trusted information assistant... That makes me very optimistic about Alexa's future, and that's how we think about it at Amazon.""Looking ahead, Prasad added that much-discussed generative AI – popularized by OpenAI's ChatGPT late last year – expressly has its place with Alexa, and is both already in place and consistently developing.""As we look towards the future, we're already using large language models, or what we call generalized intelligence or generative AI,"" said Prasad. ""We've had a huge investment in this area for a long time... It's constantly making our customer experience better, and Alexa can give you much better answers because of generative AI. It's also set up in Alexa for kids or families with kids, since you can co-create stories with Alexa. So, those are the things where we're bringing the powers of generative AI in the most responsible fashion.""","May 17, 2023 at 9:00 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-has-sold-more-than-500-million-alexa-enabled-devices-drops-4-new-echo-products-140013808.html,Yahoo Finance,0.3181818181818182,0.4772727272727273,0.21400216450216453,0.5001341991341991,2023-05-17 09:00:00,2023-05-17 09:00:00,171.7100067138672,172.69000244140625,-0.9799957275390625
AAPL,Tech Giants Embrace Stock Buybacks: Its Impact on ETFs,"Share repurchases, or stock buybacks, have become increasingly prevalent in tech companies' earnings this year. According to Cornell University assistant professor Nick Guest, buybacks don't create or destroy a lot of wealth. Instead, they serve as an opportunity for management to signal their belief that the stock is undervalued, as quoted on Yahoo Finance.Critics argue that buybacks can be used to manipulate share prices, contribute to excessive executive compensation, and limit cash available for investment opportunities, thereby sacrificing growth and profitability. However, Guest's research comparing companies that repurchase shares with those that don't has found no significant evidence supporting these criticisms.Recent buyback announcements from Alphabet and Apple, amounting to $70 billion and $90 billion respectively, have drawn significant attention. While these figures may appear large, they represent only 5.2% of Google's market cap, making them relatively moderate when adjusted for market-wide comparisons.Share repurchases, or buybacks, are when a company uses its cash to buy back some of its outstanding shares from the market. This reduces the number of shares in circulation, which increases the ownership stake of existing shareholders and boosts the earnings per share (EPS) ratio.Guest suggests that stock buybacks offer more flexibility than dividends, as they can be temporarily cut during downtime and reduce the potential for cash misuse on management's pet projects. Additionally, repurchased shares can be used to compensate employees, offering benefits other than improving long-term profitability or creating additional investment opportunities.Along with Ali Ragih, a VerityData analyst, we also believe that the best time for buybacks is when the company's valuation is low, as they get the most value for their buyback. For example, if Google spends $15 billion on buybacks, a lower stock price would yield more shares for the same dollar value. Companies with high free cash flow and limited investment opportunities, like Alphabet, are well-positioned for buybacks.We all know that the tech shares were battered massively last year due to rising rates and their valuations got corrected. This opened up opportunities for them to go for solid buybacks this year. According to a recent report by S&P Dow Jones Indices, tech companies accounted for 28.8% of all buybacks in the third quarter quarter of 2022 versus Q2 2022's 32.8% and Q3 2021's 28.2%.There are several ETFs that track indices that focus on companies with high buyback rates. Here are four examples:This is one of the most popular and liquid ETFs in the market. For instance, Apple, Microsoft (MSFT), and Alphabet, which are among the top holdings of QQQ.This ETF also has exposure to some of the biggest buyback achievers in the tech sector, such as Apple, Microsoft and Cisco Systems (CSCO).The NASDAQ US BuyBack Achievers Index comprises of US securities issued by corporations that have effected a net reduction in shares outstanding of 5% or more in the trailing 12 months. The fund charges 61 bps in fees.With increasing backlash against buybacks, shareholders may see fewer of them in the future if disincentives increase or restrictions are imposed. In his State of the Union Address in early 2023, U.S. President Joe Biden will urge Congress to pass a 20% minimum tax on billionaires and increase the new 1% tax on corporate stock buybacks to 4%, the White House said.This could lead to firms retaining cash or switching to dividends, which may have negative consequences, such as higher taxes on dividends compared to repurchases that generate capital gains.Apple Inc.

AAPL,Axie Infinity's Token Jumps 12% After Firm Lists Game on Apple App Store,"Initially, Apple store users across Latin America and Asia in countries including Argentina, Colombia, Peru, Mexico, Venezuela, Indonesia, Malaysia and Vietnam will have access to the card-based game called Axie Infinity. The game already has 1.5 million installations across all platforms. Sky Mavis, the creator of the play-to-earn project, plans to expand the game's outreach via Google and Apple mobile users.AXS's price rally was accompanied by a sharp increase in the notional futures open interest or the dollar value locked in open futures contracts. That's a sign of an influx of new money into the market.However, the leverage appeared skewed to the bearish side, as funding rates in the perpetual futures market remained negative. Negative rates indicate the dominance of bearish short positions in the market.Investors probably shorted perpetual futures contracts to protect the long position in the spot market from a sudden price drop, a reflection of lack of confidence in the sustainability of the price rally.","May 17, 2023 at 5:30 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/axie-infinitys-token-jumps-12-103053788.html,CoinDesk,-0.30000000000000004,0.4,-0.14143356643356647,0.4157342657342658,2023-05-17 05:30:00,2023-05-17 05:30:00,171.7100067138672,172.69000244140625,-0.9799957275390625

""Today, we’re excited to share incredible new features that build on our long history of making technology accessible, so that everyone has the opportunity to create, communicate, and do what they love.""""Accessibility is part of everything we do at Apple,"" said Sarah Herrlinger, Apple’s senior director of Global Accessibility Policy and Initiatives. ""These groundbreaking features were designed with feedback from members of disability communities every step of the way, to support a diverse set of users and help people connect in new ways.""Assistive Access Supports Users with Cognitive DisabilitiesAssistive Access uses innovations in design to distill apps and experiences to their essential features in order to lighten cognitive load. The feature reflects feedback from people with cognitive disabilities and their trusted supporters — focusing on the activities they enjoy — and that are foundational to iPhone and iPad: connecting with loved ones, capturing and enjoying photos, and listening to music.Assistive Access includes a customized experience for Phone and FaceTime®, which have been combined into a single Calls app, as well as Messages, Camera, Photos, and Music. The feature offers a distinct interface with high contrast buttons and large text labels, as well as tools to help trusted supporters tailor the experience for the individual they support. For example, for users who prefer communicating visually, Messages includes an emoji-only keyboard and the option to record a video message to share with loved ones. Users and trusted supporters can also choose between a more visual, grid-based layout for their Home Screen and apps, or a row-based layout for users who prefer text.""The intellectual and developmental disability community is bursting with creativity, but technology often poses physical, visual, or knowledge barriers for these individuals,"" said Katy Schmid, senior director of National Program Initiatives at The Arc of the United States. ""To have a feature that provides a cognitively accessible experience on iPhone or iPad — that means more open doors to education, employment, safety, and autonomy. It means broadening worlds and expanding potential.""Live Speech and Personal Voice Advance Speech AccessibilityWith Live Speech on iPhone, iPad, and Mac®, users can type what they want to say to have it be spoken out loud during phone and FaceTime calls as well as in-person conversations. Users can also save commonly used phrases to chime in quickly during lively conversation with family, friends, and colleagues. Live Speech has been designed to support millions of people globally who are unable to speak or who have lost their speech over time.For users at risk of losing their ability to speak — such as those with a recent diagnosis of ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) or other conditions that can progressively impact speaking ability — Personal Voice is a simple and secure way to create a voice that sounds like them.""At the end of the day, the most important thing is being able to communicate with friends and family,"" said Philip Green, board member and ALS advocate at the Team Gleason nonprofit, who has experienced significant changes to his voice since receiving his ALS diagnosis in 2018. ""If you can tell them you love them, in a voice that sounds like you, it makes all the difference in the world — and being able to create your synthetic voice on your iPhone in just 15 minutes is extraordinary.""Detection Mode in Magnifier Introduces Point and Speak for Users Who Are Blind or Have Low VisionAdditional FeaturesCelebrating Global Accessibility Awareness Day Around the WorldTo celebrate Global Accessibility Awareness Day, this week Apple is introducing new features, curated collections, and more:Apple revolutionized personal technology with the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984.

AAPL,The best GPS running watches for 2023,"Because I'm the editor of Engadget by day and a volunteer coach in my free time, I often get asked which GPS watch to buy. (People also ask what I'm wearing and the answer is: All of them. I am testing all of them.) For my part, the best running watches are quick to lock in a GPS signal, offer accurate distance and pace tracking, last a long time on a charge, are comfortable to wear and easy to use.Advanced stats like VO2 Max, or maximum oxygen intake during workouts with increasing intensity, are also nice to have, along with training assessments to keep your workload in check and make sure you're getting in effective aerobic and anaerobic workouts. It's also a plus when a watch supports other sports, like cycling and swimming, which all of these do to varying extents. As for features like smartphone notifications and NFC payments, they’re not necessary for most people, especially considering they drive up the asking price.Without further ado, I bring you capsule reviews of four running watches, each of which I ultimately recommend, none of which is perfect. And keep in mind, when it comes time to make a decision of your own, there are no wrong answers here: I like Apple and Garmin enough, for instance, that I switch back and forth between them in my own training.The built-in activity tracking app is simple and addictive: I feel motivated to fill in my ""move"" (active calorie), exercise and stand rings each day. I enjoy earning award badges, even though they mean nothing. I'm grateful that the Apple Health app can pull in workouts from Garmin and every other brand featured here, and then count that toward my daily exercise and stand goals (but not my move goal, curiously).My one complaint is that the sensors don’t always track standing time accurately. I have failed to receive credit when standing for long periods in front of a stove, but occasionally I’ve been rewarded for doing absolutely nothing.As for running specifically, you're getting the basics and not much else. You can see your distance, calorie burn, heart rate readings, average pace and also rolling pace, which is your pace over the past mile at any given moment. You can also set pace alerts — a warning that you're going faster than you meant to, for example. Like earlier Apple Watches, you can also stream music or podcasts, if you have the cellular-enabled LTE model.Because the watch has a GPS sensor, you can leave your phone at home while running. Of course, no two brands of running watches will offer exactly the same distance readout on a run. That said, though Apple never explicitly claimed the Watch offers improved accurate distance tracking, the readouts here do feel more accurate than on earlier models. It’s possible that Apple is making ongoing improvements under the hood that have added up to more accurate tracking performance.For indoor runners, the Apple watch integrates with some treadmills and other exercise equipment, thanks to a two-way pairing process that essentially trades notes between the device and gym gear, formulating a more accurate estimate of your distance and effort using that shared data. In my experience, the Watch usually agrees with the treadmill on how far I ran, which is not always the case with other wearables.I also particularly appreciate that the Apple Watch automatically detects workouts after a certain period of time. I use this feature daily as I walk to and from the subway and around my neighborhood. After 10 minutes, the familiar vibrating tick, with a message asking if I want to record an outdoor walk. The answer is always yes, and the watch thankfully includes the previous 10 minutes in which I forgot to initiate a workout.Regardless of the workout type, all of your stats are listed on a series of pages, which you swipe through from left to right. In my early days using the watch, it was tempting to use the Digital Crown as a stopwatch button, similar to how I use other running watches. This urge has mostly subsided as I've gotten more comfortable with the user interface.Like many of its competitors, the Apple Watch has an auto-pause option, which I often use in start-and-stop workouts. I also found in side-by-side comparisons (one watch on each wrist), that auto-pause on the Watch reacts faster than on Garmin models.Conveniently, the Apple Watch can export workouts to MyFitnessPal so you get credit for your calorie burn there. Of note, the Watch has all of the health features that the previous generation, including a built-in ECG test for cardiac arrhythmias, along with fall detection, a blood oxygen test, respiratory tracking, emergency calls and menstrual tracking. Also like previous models, there’s a built-in compass and international emergency calling.Unfortunately, the stats themselves are fairly limited, without much room for customization. There's no mode for interval workouts, either by time or distance. There's also not much of an attempt to quantify your level of fitness, your progress or the strenuousness of your workouts or training load. None of this should be a dealbreaker for more casual runners.For more detailed tracking, your best bet is to experiment with third-party running apps for the iPhone, like Strava, RunKeeper, MapMyRun, Nike Run Club and others. It's through trial and error that I finally found an app with Watch support and timed intervals. But at the end of the day, it's easier to wear a purpose-built running watch when I'm running outdoors, sync my data to Apple Health, get my exercise and standing-time credit, and then put the Apple Watch back on the first chance I get. But if you can only afford one smartwatch for training and life, there's a strong case for choosing this one.Like other Garmin watches, even the entry-level ones, you also get feedback on your training load and training status (unproductive, maintaining, productive, peaking, overreaching, detraining and recovery), a “Body Battery” energy rating, recommended recovery time, plus Garmin Coach and a race time predictor. And you can analyze “running dynamics” if you also have a compatible accessory.Speaking of the screen, the watch face, available in four colors, is easy to read in direct sunlight, and weighs a not-too-heavy 47g. That light weight, combined with the soft silicone band, makes it comfortable to wear for long stretches. Garmin rates the battery life at up to seven days, or up to 16 hours with GPS in use. (That figure drops to six hours when you combine GPS tracking with music playback.) In my testing, I was still at 88 percent after three hours of GPS usage. Most of my weekday runs are around 35 minutes and that, it turns out, only puts a roughly two- or three-percent dent in the battery capacity.Aside from some advanced running and cycling features, what makes the 745 one of the more expensive models in Garmin’s line are its smartwatch features. That includes Garmin Pay, the company’s contactless payments system, and music storage for up to 500 tracks on the device. You can also mirror your smartphone notifications and use calendar and weather widgets. Just know you can enjoy that even on Garmin’s entry-level model (more on that below).I can see there being two schools of thought here: if someone plans to wear this watch for many hours a week working out, it may as well get as close as possible to a less sporty smartwatch. Then there’s my thinking: You’re probably better off stepping down to a model that’s nearly as capable on the fitness front, but that doesn’t pretend as hard to be a proper smartwatch.What you give is Garmin Pay; the option of all-day blood oxygen tracking; the sleep score; a gyroscope and barometric altimeter; floors climbed; heat and altitude acclimation; yoga and pilates workouts; training load focus; the Trendline feature; round-trip course creation, Garmin and Strava live segments; and lactate threshold tracking (and for this you would need an additional accessory amway).It turns out, mostly not. As an entry-level watch, the 45S offers everything beginners (and even some intermediate) runners could want, including distance tracking, basic fitness tracking (steps, calories), heart rate monitoring and a blood oxygen test. Also, as much as the 45S is aimed at new runners, you’ll also find modes for indoor and outdoor cycling, elliptical machines, stair climbers and yoga.Coming from the 745, I was especially pleased to see that many of Garmin’s best training tools and recovery features carry down even to the base-level model. That includes training status, training load, training effect, Garmin Coach, Body Battery, stress tracking, a race time predictor and running dynamics analysis (again, an additional accessory is required). Like other Garmin watches, you can enable incident detection, with the caveat that you'll need your smartphone nearby for it to work.It even functions as a perfunctory smartwatch, with smartphone notifications, music playback controls, calendar and weather widgets, and a duo of “find my phone” and “find my watch” features. Although I’ve criticized Garmin’s smartwatch features in the past for feeling like half-baked add-ons, I was still pleasantly surprised to find them on what’s marketed as a running watch for novices.As for the hardware, the watch feels lightweight, at 32 grams for the 39mm model (36g for the 42mm). It’s available in five colors, slightly more than Garmin’s more serious models. The 1.04-inch touchscreen was easy to glance at mid-workout, even in direct sunlight. The battery, which is rated for seven days (or 13 hours in GPS mode) does not need to be charged every day. In fact, if it really is beginners using this, their short trail runs should barely put a dent in the overall capacity. As with the Forerunner 745, my complaint is never with the impressive battery life, just the fact that you have to use a proprietary charging cable.And, while this watch wasn’t made for competitive swimmers, you can use it in the pool without breaking it. The 5 ATM water resistance rating means it can survive the equivalent of 50 meters of water pressure, which surely includes showering and shallow-water activities.As you might expect, a device this inexpensive has some trade-offs, and I’ll get to those in a minute. But there’s actually a lot to like. The watch itself is lightweight and water resistant, with a low-power color display that’s easy to read in direct sunlight. That low-power design also means the battery lasts a long time — up to 40 hours on a charge. Perhaps most importantly, it excels in the area that matters most: as a sports watch. In my testing the built-in GPS allowed for accurate distance and pace tracking. If you’re not a runner, or you just prefer a multi-sport life, the watch features nine other modes covering most common activities, including walking, yoga, cycling, pool and open-water swimming and free weights.And did I mention the heart rate monitor? These readings are also seemingly accurate.What you lose by settling for a watch this cheap is mainly the sort of polished user experience you’d get with a device from a tier-one company like Apple or even Garmin (not that Garmin’s app has ever been my favorite either). In my review, I noticed various goofs, including odd grammar and punctuation choices and a confusingly laid-out app.I was also bummed to learn you could barely export your data to any third-party apps, other than Strava and Apple Health. You also can’t customize the way data is displayed on-screen during a workout, while your goals don't auto-adjust the way they might on other platforms. Fortunately, at least, these are all issues that can be addressed after the fact via software updates — hopefully sooner rather than later.","May 15, 2023 at 11:16 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/m/5daa500c-3147-3dc9-8f5e-d508fa140873/the-best-gps-running-watches.html,Engadget,1.0,0.3,0.16560953531812422,0.48213544294832633,2023-05-15 11:16:00,2023-05-15 11:16:00,173.16000366210938,172.07000732421875,1.089996337890625

AAPL,Strong Tech Earnings Fail to Quell Investor Worries Over Growth and Valuation,"(Bloomberg) -- One quarter down and it’s so far, so good for the tech sector.Most Read from BloombergTurkey Latest: Erdogan Says Unclear If Vote Will Go to RunoffTurkey Set for Runoff as Erdogan Falls Just Short of VictoryS&P ETF Barely Budges on Yellen’s Late-Day Notice: Markets WrapRemote Work Comes With Daytime Drug and Drinking HabitsMicrosoft’s $69 Billion Activision Deal Wins EU ApprovalResults this earnings season have mostly come in better than feared, and share prices have responded positively. Yet looking to the rest of the year, many investors continue to harbor concerns about growth and valuation.Olivier Sarfati, head of equities at GenTrust, is “very cautious” of the outlook for the sector, despite what he described as a “great” season for big tech. “You need to see additional growth to justify gains beyond what we’ve already seen, and that will be difficult,” he said.The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 Index has risen less than 2% since April 18, when Netflix Inc. reported as the first of the widely watched technology and internet group, outpacing the S&P 500’s 0.8% decline over the same period. That’s extended the tech-heavy index’s year-to-date gain to 22%, pushing valuations to elevated levels. Apple Inc. and Microsoft Corp. both saw pronounced post-earnings rallies, and are among the notable names trading at premiums to both the market and their own history.The Nasdaq 100 Index was little changed on Monday.Justifying such multiples could prove difficult in a slower-growth environment, with Bank of America Corp. strategists among those who expect a recession to reverse tech’s rally.Sarfati cited a number of headwinds that could weigh on the sector beyond its valuation and growth prospects, including a wider fallout from turmoil in the banking sector, and inflation staying high and leading to a rebound in Treasury yields, a key headwind behind tech’s 2022 selloff.“I worry about 2024 earnings because I don’t think estimates have been brought in enough, and there are only so many times tech can go to the cost-cutting well to generate upside,” he said. “I suspect headwinds will start blowing stronger and stronger until we really feel it.”With concerns having been high ahead of earnings season, most tech companies have cleared a lowered bar. According to data compiled by Bloomberg, 86% of those in the S&P 500 have topped estimates for profit, while 76% have for revenue.Still, the full-year outlook is gloomy. Earnings for the S&P 500 tech sector are expected to decline 8.8% this year, while revenue is seen falling 1%, per Bloomberg Intelligence. That compares with a drop of 2.5% for earnings in the overall S&P 500, which is expected to see revenue growth of 1.9% this year.Growth in both earnings and revenue is expected to accelerate next year, eclipsing the pace of the S&P 500, but analysts have been trimming their 2024 expectations. Currently, they expect tech earnings growth of 15% in 2024, compared with the 16% pace expected a few weeks ago. Estimates for revenue growth have also come down.With stocks rising and profit estimates falling, the tech sector is getting more expensive. At 24 times projected earnings, the Nasdaq 100 is above its long-term average and within spitting distance of the highest in more than a year.“People have been hiding out in big tech, but now a lot of expectations have been built into the idea of them as stable growers, and they will have to live up to that to continue to support these valuations,” said Anthony Saglimbene, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial. “This has been a good earnings season relative to our worst fears, but the growth rate is naturally slowing, and if there is a more material downdraft in fundamentals, the sector might be pressured.”Tech Chart of the DayApple’s 33% year-to-date rally has given the iPhone maker a market capitalization of $2.71 trillion, exceeding that of the Russell 2000 Index for the first time since 2020.

AAPL,Billionaire Ken Fishers Top 10 Stock Picks,"Our MethodologyFor this article we picked the top 10 stocks from Ken Fisher's hedge fund portfolio for the first quarter of 2023.Fisher Asset Management’s Holdings: $2,346,771,000 Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is the world's largest chip manufacturer.Like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is one of the top stock picks of billionaire Ken Fisher.“Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) contributed to performance as revenues grew +27% (in USD) from the year ago quarter. Despite this strength, the Company’s customers have seen near-term weakness in demand due to Covid-19 normalization as well as the launch timing of new products. However, the Company is well-positioned to continue a long-term growth trajectory because its leading-edge capacity is being absorbed by high-performance computing applications, particularly at nontraditional integrated circuit (IC) design houses, such as Apple, Alphabet and Amazon, which have become IC-design powerhouses over the past decade. Importantly, the Company’s aggressive investment in leading-edge equipment, tight development with fabless IC designers, and embrace of open development libraries, should continue to foster a superior competitive position and attractive long-term growth.”Fisher Asset Management’s Holdings: $2,478,511,000 The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) is a leading home improvement retailer with over 2,300 stores and a strong omnichannel network.Fisher Asset Management started building its position in The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) in the first quarter of 2012 and, in the first quarter of 2023, holds over 8.40 million shares in the company, valued at $2.49 billion. The company represents 1.5% of the hedge fund’s 13F portfolio.“The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) provided an update on reducing the environmental impact of its stores. Since 2010, the company has reduced U.S. store electricity use by 50% by implementing LED lighting across all of its stores, buying electricity from large-scale commercial solar farms, and installing rooftop solar farms. The company is now applying its experience to other parts of its operations, including reducing electricity use in its supply chain and water use in store irrigation. Home Depot was also recognized by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for being one of the nation’s largest green power users.”Fisher Asset Management’s Holdings: $2,579,321,000 Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is a semiconductor company that makes chips for various applications, including PCs, gaming, cloud services, and automotive.On May 3, Truist analyst William Stein increased Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)'s price target to $84 from $79, but maintained a ‘Hold’ rating on the stock. Despite the company's revenue exceeding expectations due to the upside in Gaming and Embedded segments, the analyst is concerned about AMD's weaker Q2 guidance and increasing investments in AI.Fisher's hedge fund also strengthened its position in Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) by buying 431,867 additional shares in Q1.“Last quarter we added Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) to the portfolio at 18x earnings and quickly made it into a top 5 position. At that time, Mr. Market was worried about earnings revisions for semiconductor stocks. In Q1 2023, it has been one of our best performing positions with the stock up 50%! In just three months, the market realized that Artificial Intelligence (AI) and related technologies require a lot of semiconductors. Mr. Market really is manic depressive but this volatility can give the enterprising investor just enough of a window to pick stocks with attractive risk rewards.”Fisher Asset Management’s Holdings: $2,798,969,000 Percentage of Fisher Asset Management’s Portfolio: 1.69%NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides graphics, compute, and networking solutions globally.Ken Fisher is also bullish on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) as of the end of the first quarter of 2023. His fund increased its holding in NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) by 1% in the first quarter, ending the period with over 10.08 million shares of the company.“NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a semiconductor mega-cap company and global leader in gaming cards and accelerated computing hardware and software. Shares of NVIDIA rose over 90% during the first quarter because of material developments in generative AI evidenced by the release of ChatGPT and other competitive models. On its fourth quarter fiscal 2023 earnings call on February 22, Colette Kress, NVIDIA’s CFO said, “AI adoption is at an inflection point.… The opportunity is significant and driving strong growth in data center that will accelerate through the year.” On the same call, Jensen Huang, NVIDIA’s CEO emphasized: “The accumulation of technology breakthroughs has brought AI to an inflection point. Generative AI’s versatility and capability has triggered a sense of urgency at enterprises around the world to develop and deploy AI strategies.… NVIDIA AI is essentially the operating system of AI systems today.… The activity around AI infrastructures…has just gone through the roof in the last 60 days. And so there’s no question that whatever our views [were] of this year as we enter[ed] this year has fairly dramatically changed as a result over the last 60, 90 days.” Indeed, our research indicates that shortages of NVIDIA GPUs3 are the biggest gating factor for AI adoption and that about 90% of AI-model training runs are performed on their GPUs. During its annual GTC conference4 in March, NVIDIA announced new products and services that expand its addressable market and together form a full AI computing platform. These included: (1) new AI training systems (where it is dominant) and inferencing systems (where the field is more wide open), such as specialized chips in the areas of large language models and recommender systems, simulation and graphics rendering, and video use cases; (2) new fully managed AI services in partnership with the major cloud service providers, called NVIDIA DGX Cloud and NVDIA Omniverse Cloud; (3) new domain-specific generative AI foundational models, branded NVIDIA AI Foundations, which NVIDIA customers can harness to build and train custom language models with their own proprietary data to develop differentiated offerings; and (4) industry-specific accelerator libraries, spanning such diverse verticals as genomics analysis and computational lithography. We continue to believe NVIDIA’s end-to-end AI platform and leading market share in gaming, data centers, and robotics (including automotive), along with the size of these markets, will enable the company to drive durable growth for years to come.”Fisher Asset Management’s Holdings: $2,801,441,000 Percentage of Fisher Asset Management’s Portfolio: 1.69%Salesforce, Inc.

AAPL,Apple Insider Lowered Holding By 39% During Last Year \,"While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. Check out our latest analysis for Apple In fact, the recent sale by Senior Director of Corporate Accounting Chris Kondo was not their only sale of Apple shares this year. They previously made an even bigger sale of -US$3.0m worth of shares at a price of US$149 per share. That means that an insider was selling shares at slightly below the current price (US$173). When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. This single sale was just 39% of Chris Kondo's stake.Chris Kondo sold a total of 24.29k shares over the year at an average price of US$153. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!The last quarter saw substantial insider selling of Apple shares. Specifically, Senior Director of Corporate Accounting Chris Kondo ditched US$709k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.I like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Apple insiders own about US$1.7b worth of shares (which is 0.06% of the company). I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body. We currently account for open market transactions and private dispositions, but not derivative transactions.","May 14, 2023 at 7:00 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-insider-lowered-holding-39-120031362.html,Simply Wall St.,0.0,0.06666666666666667,0.14721428571428571,0.4542440476190476,2023-05-14 07:00:00,2023-05-14 07:00:00,,,

AAPL,Apple reportedly set to unveil its mixed-reality headset,"Yahoo Finance tech reporter Allie Garfinkle discusses a report that Apple is close to unveiling its planned mixed-reality headset.and breaks down how the release could impact investor expectations.If I had a nickel for absolutely every time that someone had just told me a rumor about this headset, I would probably be a lot closer to retirement than I am right now. However, we're getting some reports that the payoff isn't going to be quite what VR watchers, VR advocates had hoped for. Now, what do we mean by that?Let's think about what an Apple product usually is like. We usually imagine something that is streamlined, with a beautiful UX, and is plugged into this very sticky, very usable ecosystem. But the reports are saying that this Apple headset is going to be more experimental than anything we've seen from them before.Now, what does that look like? For instance, we know they're having some struggles integrating software. We know that the battery pack itself is going to be, for instance, bigger than expected-- about the size of a hand, give or take. And we also know that there could be production issues down the line.Now, we've been talking for a while about this headset possibly creating an iPhone moment, a ChatGPT moment. However, what I'm hearing from sources on the phone today is maybe as this report came out, we should start tempering our expectations just a little bit.I know I'm hitting it home, but I cannot stress how important that really is. The other thing, too, is if Apple doesn't bring a killer app, that kind of streamlined quality that makes you just want to pick something up, and wear it, and use it, it's going to be a lot harder for, I think, VR to be as sticky as I know [INAUDIBLE] watchers, as I know VR advocates are hoping it will be. In the end, if VR is sort of left without this hockey stick moment, I think the industry at large, not only Apple, not only Meta, but everyone who's interested in VR, is going to be sort of left to grapple with how far the technology really still has to come. .","May 12, 2023 at 3:08 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/apple-reportedly-set-unveil-mixed-200830780.html,Yahoo Finance Video,0.0,0.0,0.09185823754789271,0.5070539135194307,2023-05-12 15:08:00,2023-05-12 15:08:00,173.6199951171875,172.57000732421875,1.04998779296875

AMZN,Dissecting Retail Earnings and Shifting Consumer Spending Trends,"It is no surprise that the combined weight of elevated inflation, rising interest rates, and uncertainty about the economy has forced consumers to change their spending behavior.The issue has undoubtedly been at play with lower-income households for some time now. But we can intuitively appreciate that it will not stay restricted to this consumer segment alone and will most likely move up the income chain in the days ahead.We saw some of that in the Walmart WMT report that showed the retailer benefiting from higher-income consumers ‘trading down’ to its stores and digital offerings in response to the aforementioned headwinds. The expected continuation of this same trend is also at the root of management’s upgraded guidance for the year.Another trend at play is the shift in consumer preference for ‘wants’ instead of ‘needs.’ Given the macroeconomic clouds, it makes intuitive sense that consumers will rationally shift away from discretionary spending categories without curbing their demand for essentials. Walmart is better positioned than Target TGT for such an environment, given its significantly bigger grocery business.However, we should keep in mind that consumers aren’t moving away from all discretionary categories as they continue to spend on leisure, hospitality, and travel services. Consumers spent heavily on discretionary ‘goods’ during Covid and seem to be in no hurry to replace them. But they seem to be making up for missing out on the ‘experiential’ discretionary services of the type mentioned above.Some of this is likely tied to income distributions as well, with lower-income consumers restricting their spending to their needs and pulling back on discretionary spending of all types.An excellent example of this is Friday’s Foot Locker FL bombshell, with the company not only missing estimates but significantly cutting guidance for the year. Foot Locker is heavily exposed to lower-income consumers, and that demographic’s outlook remains uncertain, particularly if the labor market starts losing ground going forward because of macroeconomic factors.The retail business is a tough and competitive space even in ‘normal’ times, and these are anything but normal times.They need just the right amount of inventory. Otherwise, they will either lose sales if they don’t have enough merchandise, as was the case earlier in the pandemic, or will need to offer steeper discounts and hurt margins if they have too much of it, as we saw with Walmart WMT and Target TGT last year.Then there is outright theft, referred to as ‘shrink’ by the retailers. Target estimates that ‘shrink’ will be a $500 million hit to its earnings this year. Most management teams shy away from quantifying the full extent of this problem. But published comments from retail industry professionals suggest that the problem has never been this big.Retailers also need to ensure they have the correct type of merchandise, as we saw with Target and Walmart having too much patio furniture last Spring that consumers weren’t interested in buying. Keeping stores fully staffed in a tight labor market and ensuring just the right amount of price discounts are some of the other challenges that big-box operators like Walmart, Target, and others face daily.Both Walmart and Target have done an excellent job on the inventory front, but part of the reason for the Foot Locker guidance cut is the inventory pileup. What is most intriguing concerning Foot Locker is that they failed to see any of this during their March 2023 update.It all comes down to execution and management effectiveness.In a backdrop of moderating and shifting consumer spending behavior, some retailers have been more successful than others. Walmart has been better, Target less so.You can see this in the one-year performance of Walmart (blue line, up +26.2%) and Target (red line, down -0.8%) relative to the S&P 500 index (green line, up +8%). We added Foot Locker (orange line, down -2.3%) to the mix to show the stock’s dramatic fall after the aforementioned earnings disappointment.The Zacks Retail sector includes not only Walmart, Target, and other traditional retailers but also online vendors like Amazon and restaurant players. The 26 Zacks Retail companies in the S&P 500 index that have reported Q1 results already include the e-commerce and restaurant industries.Total Q1 earnings for these 26 retailers that have reported are up +6.2% from the same period last year on +6.6% higher revenues, with 84.6% beating EPS estimates and 65.4% beating revenue estimates.The comparison charts below put the Q1 beats percentages for these retailers in a historical context.With respect to the earnings and revenue growth rates, we like to show the group’s performance with and without Amazon, whose results are among the 26 companies that have reported already. As we know, Amazon’s Q1 earnings were up +46.8% on +9.4% higher revenues, as it beat top and bottom-line expectations.As we all know, the digital and brick-and-mortar operators have been converging for some time now. Amazon is now a decent-sized brick-and-mortar operator after Whole Foods, and Walmart is a growing online vendor. This long-standing trend got a huge boost from the Covid lockdowns.The two comparison charts below show the Q1 earnings and revenue growth relative to other recent periods, both with Amazon’s results (left side chart) and without Amazon’s numbers (right side chart)Q1 Earnings Season Scorecard The proportion of these companies beating both EPS and revenue estimates is 63%.Regular readers of our earnings commentary know that we have been referring to the overall picture emerging from the Q1 earnings season as good enough; not great, but not bad either.With this reporting cycle now largely behind us, we can confidently say that corporate earnings aren’t headed towards the ‘cliff’ that market bears were warning us of.The way we see it, the ‘better-than-feared’ view of the Q1 earnings season at this stage may be a bit unfair, given how resilient corporate profitability has turned out to be. But the view isn’t entirely off the mark either.We have about 150 companies on deck to report results, including 15 S&P 500 members. This week’s docket includes Lowe’s, Nvidia, Best Buy, Ralph Lauren, Dicks Sporting Goods, and others.Below, we compare the Q1 results thus far from what we have seen from this same group of 459 index members in other recent periods.The first set of charts compares the earnings and revenue growth rates for the companies that have reported with what we had seen from the group in other recent quarters.The comparison charts below put the Q1 EPS and revenue beats percentages in a historical context.The Earnings Big Picture To get a sense of what is currently expected, take a look at the chart below that shows current earnings and revenue growth expectations for the S&P 500 index for 2023 Q1 and the following three quarters.As you can see here, 2023 Q1 earnings are expected to be down -3.8% on +4.4% higher revenues. This would follow the -5.4% earnings decline in the preceding period (2022 Q4) on +5.9% higher revenues.The chart below shows the year-over-year change in net income margins for the S&P 500 index.Actual results provide a lot better on this front relative to what was expected ahead of the releases, with the outperformance particularly notable for the Tech sector.The chart below shows the earnings and revenue growth picture on an annual basis.One notable recent development on the earnings front, which we have been flagging in recent weeks, is the reversal on the revisions front, with full-year 2023 earnings starting to go up since the start of April. This comes after almost a year of steady declines in full-year 2023 earnings, which peaked in April 2022.Since the start of 2023 Q2, aggregate bottom-up S&P 500 earnings are flat or unchanged as a whole and +0.4%, excluding the Energy sector, whose estimates have been coming down. In fact, estimates for 8 of the 16 Zacks sectors are up since the start of Q2, with notable increases in the Construction, Industrial Products, Autos, Retail, and Tech sectors. On the negative side, estimates are coming down for the Energy, Basic Materials, Aerospace, and Transportation sectors.For a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report >>>>Decoding Recent Positive Earnings Estimate Revisions  Target Corporation (TGT) : Free Stock Analysis ReportWalmart Inc.

AMZN,Alibaba Makes Another Step Towards Unlocking Value,"Revenue for the quarter ended on March 31st amounted to $29.6 billion, missing estimates but rising 2% YoY. Although non-GAAP diluted earnings per share missed expectations as they amounted to 1.34 yuan, they were up 35% YoY. The adjusted net profit rose 38% YoY as it rose up to $4.0 billion.Like Amazon, Walmart and Home Depot, Alibaba observed a slow start of the year with total sales of physical goods. But China, where Alibaba operates generates almost half of the world’s global online transactions, saw its retail sales in April rise 18.4% and Alibaba said it already observed a positive momentum in March after the initial slowdown. However, results didn’t show the improvement for March as analysts had hoped.While Microsoft topped cloud expectations with its latest reported quarter, this unit was a weak spot during the reported quarter as sales dropped 3% YoY, mostly due to January’s delivery delays due to COVID-19 restrictions as well as a loss of top overseas customer. Even Amazon warned of a cloud growth slowdown in its latest reported quarter.What is also interesting is that Alibaba’s quarterly report also came with a mission statement of the Chinese titan working to make cloud computing more affordable and accessible.Alibaba’s cloud comes hand in hand with AI. Like Microsoft, Alibaba developed its own ChatGPT-style generative AI tool earlier this year which is expected to help accelerate customer adoption of its cloud computing service. CEO Daniel Zhang is expecting this technology to bring an exponential increase in computing power.Alibaba’s story continues to be written as the company has taken steps towards unlocking the value of its business. While its tech peers in the U.S. are cautiously turning around, Alibaba’s results have significantly improved, with the latest results being significantly stronger from last year’s comparable quarter. Considering that the latest quarter had the strongest growth rate in the fiscal year that was just closed, momentum is on Alibaba’s side. Meanwhile, both Microsoft and Amazon gave cautious and lackluster guidance. If other things remain equal and this trend continues, Alibaba could bring in significantly higher profits in the undergoing fiscal year.DISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

AMZN,Here is Why Growth Investors Should Buy Amazon (AMZN) Now,"Growth investors focus on stocks that are seeing above-average financial growth, as this feature helps these securities garner the market's attention and deliver solid returns. But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task.That's because, these stocks usually carry above-average risk and volatility. In fact, betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss.However, the task of finding cutting-edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.Amazon (AMZN) is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends. The company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this online retailer a great growth pick right now.Earnings GrowthArguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.While the historical EPS growth rate for Amazon is 17.3%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 120.5% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 36.3%.Impressive Asset Utilization RatioGrowth investors often overlook asset utilization ratio, also known as sales-to-total-assets (S/TA) ratio, but it is an important feature of a real growth stock. This metric shows how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales.Right now, Amazon has an S/TA ratio of 1.18, which means that the company gets $1.18 in sales for each dollar in assets. Comparing this to the industry average of 0.77, it can be said that the company is more efficient.In addition to efficiency in generating sales, sales growth plays an important role. And Amazon looks attractive from a sales growth perspective as well. The company's sales are expected to grow 9% this year versus the industry average of 0%.Promising Earnings Estimate RevisionsSuperiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.The current-year earnings estimates for Amazon have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 15.1% over the past month.Bottom LineAmazon has not only earned a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This combination indicates that Amazon is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.Amazon.com, Inc.

AMZN,Alibaba to Exit Cloud Business After Beijing Undercuts Potential,"(Bloomberg) -- Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.’s surprise move to fully spin out a potentially transformative $12 billion cloud business is stirring speculation about whether the Chinese e-commerce leader bowed to market or political realities.Most Read from BloombergDisney Drops Plan to Move Workers to Florida, Closes HotelWall Street Fears $1 Trillion Aftershock From Debt DealNYC Skyscrapers Sit Vacant, Exposing Risk City Never PredictedUkraine Leader Zelenskiy to Visit Hiroshima in Bid to Rally AidMorgan Stanley CEO Gorman to Step Down Within 12 MonthsChief Executive Officer Daniel Zhang dropped a bombshell Thursday when he unveiled the contours of Alibaba’s historic six-way shakeup for the first time. Included among the listing and financing of a plethora of businesses was a plan to fully relinquish control of the business known as Alibaba Cloud, a once-thriving operation that harbored the potential to supercharge the company the way Amazon Web Services grew to signify Amazon.com Inc.At the heart of the issue is why Alibaba chose to sever a business some analysts value at upwards of $30 billion, a prime beneficiary of a post-ChatGPT upswell that depends on cloud resources to train next-generation AI models. In doing so, it’s hiving off a unit that comes with historical baggage and its own share of business uncertainty. Alibaba dived as much as 5.9% in Hong Kong Friday, after also reporting disappointing Chinese commerce figures.China’s most valuable online commerce firm invested tens of billions over more than a decade in the business of hosting computing for corporations over the internet. For years, it was among Alibaba’s proudest and most often-touted accomplishments, a business that outstripped rival offerings from Tencent Holdings Ltd. and Baidu Inc., grew more global in flavor than any other division, and spearheaded important inhouse initiatives.But government scrutiny of cloud services operated by private firms intensified around 2020, when Beijing grew suspicious of privately owned repositories of sensitive and valuable data, triggering a now-infamous sweeping crackdown on the internet sphere. AliCloud itself drew regulatory ire in 2021 for discovering then sharing a major software flaw before informing authorities, and was then investigated in 2022 for its role in China’s largest known cybersecurity data leak. The cloud division in recent years began to bleed market share to rivals including Huawei Technologies Co. and state-run China Mobile Ltd.“It’s positive for shareholders as it represents a significant capital return, but once fully distributed the cloud business will no longer add to Alibaba Holdco’s valuation,” said Vey Sern Ling, managing director at Union Bancaire Privee. “The company says cloud business is relatively independent and unrelated to its core e-commerce businesses. But investors may wonder if the government told them to break up.”Read more: Alibaba Breakup Begins With Spinoff of $12 Billion Cloud ArmKey Points of the Breakup BlueprintAlibaba plans to spin off its cloud services division as an independent entity by distributing stock to shareholders over the next yearThat means Alibaba could eventually end up not owning shares in China’s biggest cloud services platformIt will aim to float its Cainiao logistics arm within 12 to 18 monthsMost immediately, the firm aims to complete an IPO for the Freshippo grocery chain within the coming yearAnd it plans to secure external financing for its international commerce division, which encompasses overseas operations such as Singapore-based LazadaLike Amazon’s, Alibaba’s cloud service emerged from the computational power needed to handle millions of simultaneous online shopping transactions. But unlike its US counterpart, it enjoyed home-field advantage in a vast Chinese market where web-based computing was (and still is) novel to many enterprises. Its push into the cloud, where software and services are provided to customers via server farms the size of football fields, was once envisioned as helping cushion Alibaba against domestic shocks to its core operation.Zhang said Thursday the cloud arm pretty much runs itself as an independent operation. But it’s also inextricably intertwined with some of the company’s most pivotal undertakings.Cloud drives its signature Singles’ Day gala, an annual event that showcases the company’s enormous global reach in online shopping. It helped power hundreds of thousands of transactions per second — a phenomenal endeavor Alibaba has unfailingly credited the cloud division with enabling. The unit contributed to profit for the first time around late 2020, helping prop up the bottom line just as Covid-era shocks hammered shopping. And it houses the DAMO academy that works on potentially groundbreaking, moonshot projects from chip design to quantum computing.Read more: Scrutiny of Alibaba in Record Breach May Ensnare All China TechIn fiscal 2022, it generated nearly $12 billion of revenue for the company — 8% of turnover. It was so important that in March, when Alibaba first unveiled its six-way breakup, Zhang personally took the helm of what he called the Cloud Intelligence division — seemingly signaling it was destined for greater things.“This full spinoff plan involving AliCloud is both bold and puzzling,” Nomura Holdings Inc analysts Jialong Shi and Thomas Shen wrote in a note. Their current valuation for the unit stands at about $31 billion. “AliCloud is BABA’s organic business and is still deemed as one of the long-term drivers for the group even though its growth temporarily slowed down in recent quarters due to macro headwinds. That is why we find it puzzling that BABA has decided to fully spin off this business instead of retaining a minority stake at least.”The tide had turned against the business several years before. Beijing’s relentless and widespread crackdown on its formerly high-flying tech giants since late 2020 had nudged risk-averse institutions toward state-owned providers.Large-scale businesses like the China Construction Bank and local municipalities in cities such as Nantong were already moving closer to state-backed cloud platforms, Bloomberg News has reported.Ultimately, Alibaba may have acceded to business considerations. Zhang said the cloud spinoff was intended to simplify the structure and respond to market needs. A standalone platform could grow to someday even surpass Alibaba in size if it attracted the right external financing, he told analysts Thursday without elaborating.“The planned spin-out comes at a challenging time for the Cloud business, which seems to have lost the growth initiative,” said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Robert Lea.Read more: Alibaba’s $32 Billion Day Signals Breakups for China Tech--With assistance from Vlad Savov.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekApple’s New Headset Meets RealityThe True Cost of an Extended US Debt-Ceiling StandoffJapan’s New Military Might Is Rising in a Factory in HiroshimaESG Investing Goes Quiet After Blistering Republican AttacksSweetgreen Tests Robots to Make Faster, More Efficient Sad Desk Salads©2023 Bloomberg L.P.","May 19, 2023 at 12:48 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alibaba-exit-cloud-business-beijing-054846289.html,Bloomberg,0.0,1.0,0.12283658443296998,0.4327474399763556,2023-05-19 00:48:00,2023-05-19 00:48:00,118.16000366210938,116.25,1.910003662109375
AMZN,25 Most Technologically Advanced Cities in the World,"After COVID-19, 2023 will likely be a gloomier year for technology. Due to geopolitical and economic instability, the next stage of technology growth is being handled with greater caution. Leaders will need to find ways to accomplish more with fewer resources, see opportunities where innovations collide, and choose wisely which technologies to invest in when they approach a tipping point.Technology advances are crucial to the creation of smart cities. Urban settings may be made more effective, sustainable, and livable with the help of modern technology. Modern data-driven technologies can help address environmental issues, reduce resource consumption, optimize urban infrastructure, and improve the quality of life for city dwellers. Examples include digital water systems, smart grids, digital transportation, data-driven traffic management, and Internet of Things (IoT) applications.However, there are challenges that should be considered and addressed, such as how fast urbanization might cause a housing crisis or how a lackluster internet infrastructure can cause sustainability problems. City planners may construct resilient, livable, and inclusive cities that successfully handle the issues of overcrowding and mass urban migration while enhancing the general quality of life for urban people by placing a high priority on holistic urban sustainability.Soon, AI-enabled Edge servers may examine multiple video feeds from store aisle cameras to look for large amounts of merchandise being removed at once and monitor deliveries to help retailers better manage their inventory and quickly cope with supply and demand, enhancing sales and earnings and ensuring consumers receive in return of their heavy investment.yuttana Contributor Studio/Shutterstock.comSo, without further delay, let us examine the list of the 25 most technologically advanced cities globally.Number of tech startups = 168There are about 101,000 ICT workers in Stockholm.

AMZN,Billionaire David Teppers 2023 Portfolio: Top 15 Stock Picks,"After a tumultuous 2022 and a start to 2023 that saw markets focus on whether the Federal Reserve would finally end its interest rate hiking cycle and if this would cause a recession, over the past couple of months a new complication has made its way into the financial markets. This is the U.S. debt ceiling, and it sits right at the heart of the American economy and by extension, the global economy. The debt ceiling is decided by Congress, and it serves as a check for the executive branch - or the Treasury Department under the President - to limit the amount of money that it can borrow to meet debt repayments.The back and forth between the president and Congress for this ceiling has often created turmoil in the financial market. In fact, this tussle also caused S&P Global Ratings to downgrade U.S. government debt to AA+ from AAA in 2011 - the first and only time in history that America received a downgrade which is often reserved for developing countries with fiscal mismanagement. The impact of this downgrade on the stock markets was immediate, with all major indexes declining by as much as seven percent in the aftermath.Our Methodology Appaloosa Management's Q1 2023 Investment: $31 million Tesla, Inc.

Perhaps the best part about Worksport's renewable technology is that it will turn pickups into renewable energy microgrids on four wheels, whether they run on electricity or combustion engines.It's not only Tesla whose EV and energy storage business are booming as this boom has touched upon many industries and lives across the globe along with disrupting the automotive industry..© 2023 Benzinga.com.

AMZN,Wall Street Analysts Think Amazon (AMZN) Is a Good Investment: Is It?,"When deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock, investors often rely on analyst recommendations. Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?Amazon currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.17, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 39 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.17 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 39 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 33 are Strong Buy and five are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 84.6% and 12.8% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for AMZNDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.ABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Should You Invest in AMZN?Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for Amazon, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 15.1% over the past month to $1.57.Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Amazon.

AMZN,"Zacks Earnings Trends Highlights: KB Home, Amazon and Microsoft","Chicago, IL – May 18, 2023– Zacks Director of Research Sheraz Mian says, ""Earnings estimates for full-year 2023 appear to have reversed course lately after consistently coming down for almost a year from the April 2022 peak.""The picture emerging from the Q1 earnings season continues to be one of resilience and stability, with companies not only beating estimates but also providing a good-enough outlook in an uncertain macro environment. This is helping the revision trend to turn positive lately after remaining negative for almost a year.Earnings estimates for full-year 2023 appear to have reversed course lately after consistently coming down for almost a year since the April 2022 peak.Since the start of 2023 Q2, full-year 2023 earnings estimates have increased for 10 of the 16 Zacks sectors, with Construction, Industrials, Autos, Retail, and Tech enjoying favorable estimate revisions. Estimates have come down for the Energy, Basic Materials, Transportation, Conglomerates, and Aerospace sectors.The earnings picture defied the skeptics again in the 2023 Q1 earnings season, with companies not only handily beating estimates but also providing reassuring enough guidance for the current coming quarters.We are not suggesting that earnings are great because they are not. After all, earnings growth is on track to be negative for the second quarter in a row, with the trend of declining profits expected to continue in the current period.That said, the fear of all-around downbeat guidance and management commentary still remains just that, a fear. As a result, we continue to elude the earnings cliff that the market bears have been telling us for a while.Perhaps it's only a question of time, with the day of reckoning only being deferred to the second half of the year. But for now, at least, we can feel relieved that the earnings picture is good enough.There are so many examples of bellwether companies showing that while growth has come down and conditions remain challenging, they are still profitably operating. Consumers are still spending, though there are signs of weakness at the margin.The Q1 earnings season appears to have caused stabilization in the earnings estimate revisions trend that was consistently negative for almost a year. In fact, since the start of 2023 Q2 in April, full-year 2023 earnings estimates in the aggregate have actually increased a bit, with estimates for 9 of the 16 Zacks sectors modestly up in that period.The favorable reversal in the revisions trend is particularly notable for the Construction, Industrial Products, Retail, and Technology sectors. As we noted last week, you can see this in the revisions trend for a few bellwether players for these sectors, like KB Home KBH on the Construction side, Amazon AMZN for Retail, and Microsoft MSFT for the Tech sector.It is hard to know how enduring or otherwise this favorable recent turn in the revisions trend will be, but it is nevertheless a positive development.The Earnings Big PictureAs we have pointed out all along, aggregate earnings estimates for 2023 peaked in April last year and consistently came down since then. Even accounting for the aforementioned positive revisions trend in recent weeks, aggregate 2023 earnings estimates have declined by -12.7% since the April 2022 peak and -14.2% on an ex-Energy basis.Hard to tell at this stage if the revisions trend will remain on its recent positive trajectory or revert back to its original negative trend. But it is nevertheless a market-friendly development.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

The vision for these new devices, and Alexa at-large, is that Amazon can offer Alexa as an approachable, ""personal AI,"" said Rohit Prasad, Alexa's head scientist, who emphasized safety right-off-the-bat.""Of course, Alexa should do anything and everything for you, within the bounds of safety norms,"" he told Yahoo Finance. ""Trust is absolutely critical and especially in these times, it's super important that we are all being responsible about how it's being used ... I think we have to constantly be very clear about what Alexa can and cannot do, or will or will not do. I think those points are becoming even more important, and we have the durable tenet of trust being paramount.""There's also some notable international expansion, as the Echo Auto, an Alexa device for cars, will also now be available in eight new countries, including the U.K., Germany, and Japan.""The entire smart home industry is a multi-billion-dollar industry that was created with Alexa,"" said Prasad. ""If you think about entertainment, Amazon Music has been growing at an incredible rate because of Alexa, so that's a huge data point. People also don't realize that a lot of shopping happens through Alexa. Shopping attractions are growing 40% year-over-year, and more than 50% of our customers have used Alexa for a shopping attraction. Lastly, even with things that are relatively new in terms of overall capability, Alexa is a trusted information assistant... That makes me very optimistic about Alexa's future, and that's how we think about it at Amazon.""Looking ahead, Prasad added that much-discussed generative AI – popularized by OpenAI's ChatGPT late last year – expressly has its place with Alexa, and is both already in place and consistently developing.""As we look towards the future, we're already using large language models, or what we call generalized intelligence or generative AI,"" said Prasad. ""We've had a huge investment in this area for a long time... It's constantly making our customer experience better, and Alexa can give you much better answers because of generative AI. It's also set up in Alexa for kids or families with kids, since you can co-create stories with Alexa.

KARE 11 reported that in the spring of 2021, 125,000 of the Peloton Tread+ and Tread treadmills were recalled after a 6-year-old died.

AMZN,7 Items That Are Always Cheaper on Amazon,"However, shopping on Amazon can also be a boon to your budget -- especially if you know which items are always cheaper with the online retailer. Before you add the following items to your Walmart, Target or grocery store shopping list, check out their prices on Amazon and compare. You might be surprised at how much you can save.For example, you can find a wide variety of durable, yet plush, squeaker toys for your dog who's an aggressive chewer for $7 or less. However, if you check at PetSmart, you'll only find a handful of toys that go for the same price including what's on sale.Some parents don't have the option of buying whatever brand of baby wipe is on sale due to their little one's sensitive skin. On Amazon, however, there's a good chance you can get the wipe you want (or something similar) and save.And if you want to really stock up and save even more, opt for a 150-count box of Amazon Basics Woodcased No. 2 Pencils that are pre-sharpened for $14.05, which is just 9 cents per pencil.She added, ""Elsewhere, retailers are charging as much as $10 for the same amount, although at least one is charging $5.66 for the same product. [However], the same store is also charging $4 for delivery, which means you're getting close to that $10 mark again by shopping there. Buying this tea for [$6.99] at Amazon is particularly a good move if you have a Prime membership or if you're placing a larger order, as you should be able to avoid extra delivery charges that way.""If you do a similar search on Walmart, you might be able to find a few options that can compete with Amazon's prices, but for a larger selection of cheaper pillow covers, check Amazon first.Note that different colors and patterns are often different prices, so if you're open to random colors and/or patterns, you can get a great deal. At Walmart, you'll pay at least $9.95 for two satin pillowcases, and at Target, you'll pay $5 each.More From GOBankingRates5 Expensive Renovations Homeowners Always RegretFinancial Insight in Your Inbox: Sign Up for GBR's Daily Newsletter3 Ways to Recession Proof Your Retirement7 Things You Must Do To Create a Plan for Your MoneyDisclaimer: Photos are for representational purposes only, and prices may vary based on time, location and availability.","May 16, 2023 at 4:00 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-items-always-cheaper-amazon-110115908.html,GOBankingRates,0.0,0.0,0.057319819819819824,0.45247747747747746,2023-05-16 16:00:00,2023-05-16 16:00:00,111.0500030517578,113.4000015258789,-2.349998474121108

AMZN,"Do Its Financials Have Any Role To Play In Driving Amazon.com, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AMZN) Stock Up Recently?","Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. See our latest analysis for Amazon.com ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Amazon.com is:2.8% = US$4.3b ÷ US$155b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.03.We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.As you can see, Amazon.com's ROE looks pretty weak. Even compared to the average industry ROE of 12%, the company's ROE is quite dismal. Although, we can see that Amazon.com saw a modest net income growth of 9.6% over the past five years. Therefore, the growth in earnings could probably have been caused by other variables. For example, it is possible that the company's management has made some good strategic decisions, or that the company has a low payout ratio.As a next step, we compared Amazon.com's net income growth with the industry and were disappointed to see that the company's growth is lower than the industry average growth of 15% in the same period.Amazon.com doesn't pay any dividend, meaning that all of its profits are being reinvested in the business, which explains the fair bit of earnings growth the company has seen.","May 16, 2023 at 9:00 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/financials-role-play-driving-amazon-140024614.html,Simply Wall St.,0.0,0.25,0.07651515151515152,0.4262626262626263,2023-05-16 09:00:00,2023-05-16 09:00:00,111.0500030517578,113.4000015258789,-2.349998474121108

AMZN,Top 50 Richest Countries In The World By Net Worth,"National net wealth, also referred to as national net worth, represents the total value of a country's assets minus its liabilities. It encompasses the collective net wealth owned by the residents of a nation at a specific point in time. This measure is a crucial indicator of a country's capacity to take on debt, sustain expenditure, and is influenced by various factors including real estate and equity market prices, exchange rates, liabilities, population demographics, as well as the presence of human resources, natural resources, capital, and technological advancements.Websites that rely solely on GDP per capita or GNI (Gross National Income) as the variable to rank the richest countries in the world may oversimplify and misrepresent the true economic prosperity of a nation. While these metrics provide some insight into the average income or economic output per person, they fail to capture the complete picture of a country's wealth and well-being. GDP per capita or GNI does not account for the cost of living. A country with a high GDP per capita may still have a high cost of living, rendering the average person's purchasing power relatively low. Using these metrics without considering the cost of goods, services, and essential needs can distort the ranking of countries and mislead readers about the actual quality of life experienced by individuals. Moreover, relying solely on GDP per capita or GNI fails to capture non-monetary aspects that contribute to a nation's overall wealth and well-being. Factors such as access to quality education, healthcare, social support systems, infrastructure, and environmental sustainability are crucial indicators of a country's prosperity and should not be overlooked in evaluations of wealth. Although income and wealth are related, a high income in a given year does not necessarily mean that a country is wealthy. Accumulating wealth takes a longer period, often spanning years or even decades.Consider the example of retired individuals. Among our readership, we have thousands of retirees who do not generate an annual income exceeding $200,000. However, they have amassed substantial wealth by investing millions in stocks and bonds over the years. In terms of wealth, they are part of the top 1%, but their income alone may not place them within the top 1% bracket. This highlights the distinction between income and wealth, demonstrating that individuals can accumulate significant wealth over time, even if their annual income may not reflect their overall financial status.Our Methodology karsten-winegeart-BYPGE0ZYID8-unsplashTotal Wealth in 2021: $615 bnTotal Wealth in 2010: $331 bnPercentage Change: 85.8%Malaysia, located in Southeast Asia, is a federal constitutional monarchy comprising thirteen states and three federal territories.

The search bar at the top of the app and home page in recent years have become the default gateway for millions of shoppers seeking to find a specific product. More than half of US shoppers say they start product searches on Amazon.com, a higher share than Google, according a survey conducted earlier this year by Jungle Scout, a maker of software for sellers on Amazon.The Tech Behind Those Amazing, Flawed New Chatbots: QuickTakeEarly deployments of generative AI by Microsoft, Alphabet Inc.’s Google and others have been beset by errors in response to basic questions. But they also show how a beefed-up Microsoft Bing or Google search could offer users a more valuable way to find products.Asking Microsoft Bing — which is powered by OpenAI’s ChatGPT – to show the five best electric razors pulled up a roster of five products, including citations to reviews from Men’s Health and GQ, along with links to stores selling the products. The same search on Amazon yields a pair of ads, followed by dozens of products.Amazon’s search experience has been criticized in recent years for the increased share of results devoted to ads and other sponsored content.Generative AI uses vast quantities of data to assemble large language models that can help create text or images following a prompt. Amazon Chief Executive Officer Andy Jassy said on an earnings call last month that the technology “presents a remarkable opportunity to transform virtually every customer experience.”Amazon Web Services, the company’s cloud-computing unit, in April announced a set of services that rely on advances in generative AI. They have yet to be widely released. Meanwhile, the company is hoping to use similar technology to improve its Alexa voice assistant, Insider reported. Amazon is also building a team to use artificial intelligence tools to create photos and videos for advertising campaigns, the Information reported this month.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekApple’s New Headset Meets RealitySweetgreen Tests Robots to Make Faster, More Efficient Sad Desk SaladsThe True Cost of an Extended US Debt-Ceiling StandoffRecession Calls Keep Getting Pushed Back, Giving Soft Landing Believers HopePeyton Manning’s Omaha Productions Becomes a Media Powerhouse©2023 Bloomberg L.P.","May 15, 2023 at 12:18 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-plans-add-chatgpt-style-171802538.html,Bloomberg,0.0,0.0,0.12319241042645299,0.4712374504927696,2023-05-15 12:18:00,2023-05-15 12:18:00,111.1500015258789,111.1999969482422,-0.04999542236329546

AMZN,"Walmart, Target and Amazon are part of Zacks Earnings Preview","Chicago, IL – May 15, 2023 – Zacks.com releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises. This week’s list includes Walmart WMT, Target TGT and Amazon AMZN.The stability in Walmart shares makes intuitive sense, as its core business offers a high degree of defense during periods of economic instability and uncertainty. Walmart's 'value orientation' allows it to gain market share as relatively better-off consumers 'trade down' during times of 'economic stress.'One key point of differentiation between these two retail giants is Walmart's bigger grocery business, which gives its results greater stability given the 'staply' nature of that otherwise low-margin business. That said, groceries drive foot traffic and are also responsible for the aforementioned 'trade down' phenomenon that is helping Walmart gain share.Both companies struggled with evolving consumer behavior as the pandemic went into the rearview mirror. We saw this in their April 2022 quarterly results, for which they were punished by the market. While both took drastic steps to steady their floundering ships, Walmart clearly did a better job of adjusting to the new environment compared to Target.Total Q1 earnings for these 20 retailers that have reported are up +11% from the same period last year on +8.1% higher revenues, with 80% beating EPS estimates and 70% beating revenue estimates.The online players and restaurant operators easily beat earnings and revenue expectations.With respect to the earnings and revenue growth rates, we like to show the group's performance with and without Amazon, whose results are among the 20 companies that have reported already. As we know, Amazon's Q1 earnings were up +46.8% on +9.4% higher revenues, as it beat top and bottom-line expectations.As we all know, the digital and brick-and-mortar operators have been converging for some time now. Amazon is now a decent-sized brick-and-mortar operator after Whole Foods, and Walmart is a growing online vendor. This long-standing trend got a huge boost from the Covid lockdowns.One recurring theme in the Q1 earnings season has been the continued resilience and stability of the U.S. consumer. We heard this from the banks, the leisure and hospitality players, and consumer-facing digital operators.There is undoubtedly stress at the lower end of income distribution. Given this development, one can intuitively project moderation in consumer spending as the economy further slows down under the weight of tighter monetary conditions. We will hear more about that on the Walmart and Target earnings calls, likely in the context of their outlooks for the coming periods. But on the whole, consumer spending trends remained intact in 2023 Q1, and that's what these results will reconfirm.The proportion of these companies beating both EPS and revenue estimates is 62.7%.Regular readers of our earnings commentary know that we have been referring to the overall picture emerging from the Q1 earnings season as good enough; not great, but not bad either. With this reporting cycle now largely behind us, we can confidently say that corporate earnings aren't headed towards the 'cliff' that market bears warned us of.The way we see it, the 'better-than-feared' view of the Q1 earnings season at this stage may be a bit unfair, given how resilient corporate profitability has turned out to be. But the view isn't entirely off the mark either.We have about 300 companies on deck to report results, including 15 S&P 500 members. In addition to the aforementioned Walmart and Target reports, this week's docket includes Home Depot, TJX Cos, Cisco Systems, Applied Materials, and Deere & Company.2023 Q1 earnings are expected to be down -4.1% on +4.3% higher revenues. This would follow the -5.4% earnings decline in the preceding period (2022 Q4) on +5.9% higher revenues.Actual results are proving a lot better on the margins front relative to what was expected ahead of the releases.One notable recent development on the earnings front, which I flagged in the weekly Earnings Trends report in greater detail, is the reversal on the revisions front, with full-year 2023 earnings starting to go up since the start of April. This comes after almost a year of steady declines in full-year 2023 earnings, which peaked in April 2022.Since the start of 2023 Q2, aggregate bottom-up S&P 500 earnings have increased +0.3% as a whole and +0.6%, excluding the Energy sector, whose estimates have been coming down. In fact, estimates for 8 of the 16 Zacks sectors are up since the start of Q2, with notable increases in the Construction, Industrial Products, Autos, Retail, and Tech sectors. On the negative side, estimates are coming down for the Energy, Basic Materials, Aerospace, and Transportation sectors.For a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report >>>>Analyzing Recent Earnings Estimate Revisions  Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

AMZN,"Seas Path to Profit Paved With Layoffs, Single-Ply Toilet Paper","(Bloomberg) -- Just over a year ago, Forrest Li was laid up in bed with Covid, fretting about the future of his company, Sea Ltd. So he propped himself up on a pillow to hammer out the latest in a series of memos that would change the course of his business — and perhaps the tech industry.Most Read from BloombergHere’s How Much Wealth You Need to Join the Richest 1% GloballyMercedes Sets Out to Make Sexy Vans With Yacht-Like InteriorsThe $120 Million Ghost Ship Antigua Is Desperate to UnloadSingapore Air Hands Staff Eight Months’ Salary Bonus After Record ResultsJPMorgan Asset Says Markets Are Right to Bet on US Rate CutsSea had been a stock market phenom, racing to a market capitalization of more than $200 billion despite huge losses, but the world had changed. Investors had turned against money-losing tech companies. So Sea had to change with it, Li wrote. With a burning fever and nagging cough, he told his leadership team it was time to focus on profit and exit India.That memo kicked off a sweeping overhaul of Sea over the next few months. The company laid off roughly more than 7,500 employees, or about 10% of its workforce, though Sea declined to disclose the actual numbers. It froze pay. Li and his leadership team gave up their salaries altogether.Business-class flights were banned; everyone would fly economy, no matter how far. Daily meal expenses were capped at $30, hotels at $150 a night. Snacks disappeared from offices. Sea replaced the local luxury tea brand TWG with Lipton. In at least some restrooms, two-ply toilet paper gave way to one-ply.“We cared about every single dollar, every single cent,” Li said at his office in Singapore, his first interview in more than two years. “You can have a big dream and a big ambition, but what if you cannot survive? You always have this kind of noise back in your mind saying we may be running out of money.”Li’s shock treatment paid off. In March, Sea reported the first quarterly profit in its 14-year history, $427 million in GAAP-sanctioned net income. Its stock soared 22%. Last week, it said it would hand out 5% raises to most staff. Sea has now more than doubled its market value since November.Like so many tech startups of its generation, Sea had bled red ink for years. In fact, it lost more than $8 billion since its founding to pay for growth in its e-commerce, games and finance operations. For now at least, Sea is setting a different kind of example: It’s demonstrating that if your underlying business is sound and substantial, you can pull back on subsidies and expansions to break even.That’s proving a challenge for rivals. Among Sea’s regional competitors, Singapore’s Grab Holdings Ltd. is still losing more than $300 million a quarter, while Indonesia’s GoTo Group’s losses exceed $250 million. Sea may also cause trouble for global tech giants like Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Amazon.com Inc., which are both seeking growth in emerging markets.“What you’re seeing is a separation of proper, monetizable business models from something that is a work-in-progress,” said Amit Kunal, managing partner of Growtheum Capital, a private equity firm in Singapore, speaking broadly about the tech industry. “Sea read the market much earlier, took appropriate steps — and delivered.”Sea’s Billionaire CEO Tells Staff Worst Is Over After Job CutsLi had a premonition that trouble was coming. Back in November 2021, he hosted his leadership team at his Singapore home for dinner to mark his 44th birthday.They had much to celebrate. Sea’s shares had surged to a record in October, giving the firm a valuation of more than $200 billion, aided by a pandemic-induced boom for its online gaming unit Garena and e-commerce business Shopee. At one point in 2020, Sea was the best-performing stock in the world.But even at the dinner, Li saw ominous signs. He noticed that on Free Fire, the company’s popular multi-player mobile game with 150 million daily users, people were beginning to spend less time and money as Covid restrictions eased. The celebration turned into a debate about how the world would change after the pandemic.Then in February 2022, India abruptly banned Free Fire, along with dozens of Chinese apps, amid rising tensions between the two countries. While Li is a Singapore citizen and based his company there, he’s originally from northeastern China and Tencent Holdings Ltd. is a major shareholder. It was a huge setback in a key growth market.In March, when Li talked during a quarterly earnings call about plans to still pursue growth, investors dumped Sea shares. The firm lost more than 45% of its market value in five days. For Li, it was a wake-up call that things were worse than he’d thought. That’s when he wrote the somber memo to his team from his sickbed.Li and his senior team went into crisis mode. They began huddling every month to discuss cashflow projections, along with their regular weekly meetings. They spun through 200 different versions of financial forecasts in 2022, Li said in the interview, akin to rewriting the budget every two days.In addition to layoffs and salary freezes, Sea pulled out of Europe and most countries in Latin America.The fallout was traumatic for some. In August, a Chinese engineer posted on his WeChat account that Shopee had rescinded his job offer — just after he landed at the Singapore airport with his wife and dog. Amid a storm of negative publicity, Shopee apologized and compensated him for his losses.Employees resorted to taking money out of their own pockets to organize team events to boost morale, according to one employee, who asked not to be named as they are not authorized to speak publicly. Another described the grueling period as “cockroach times.”Li leaned on internal memos during the crisis to communicate with employees and explain what he was trying to accomplish. In an all-staff memo in September, he said top management would forgo any cash compensation until the company reached “self-sufficiency.”“We can now see that this is not a quickly passing storm,” he wrote in a 1,000-word missive at the time. “With investors fleeing for ‘safe haven’ investments, we do not anticipate being able to raise funds in the market.”At one point, Sea was proud it could offer employees the fanciest tea in Singapore, perks commensurate with the tech giants of Silicon Valley, Li said in the interview. Now he wants to break that mindset: Sea has to compete on cost with the likes of Amazon, where early employees famously forged desks out of Home Depot doors because they were cheaper.Some employees in certain offices noticed that toilet paper got thinner. Sometimes it would run out because people used more.“We’re going to continually push down the costs,” he said. “It’s not just for saving but for running the business more efficiently. This is going to be the long-term mode for us.”After Sea cut its entertainment budget so employees could no longer spring for meals with suppliers or partners, Li encouraged staff to tell them the company couldn’t afford such things any more. Sea also called most staff in Southeast Asia back to office late last year, one of the first big internet firms to do so in the region.While Li acknowledges the road has been difficult, he said he had no doubt Sea could reach breakeven. He said the company’s path, in many ways, traces the precedents of Amazon and founder Jeff Bezos.Seattle-based Amazon consistently lost money for its first years as a public company, with Bezos maintaining that investing in growth was more important than quarterly earnings. Similarly, Sea built Shopee by burning more than a billion dollars a year before overtaking local e-commerce pioneer Tokopedia in Indonesia and Alibaba’s Lazada in Southeast Asia.Li argues that Sea has a unique opportunity to bring e-commerce to emerging markets, the kinds of places where Amazon may be at a disadvantage. Success in these countries can depend on serving customers who live on remote islands, finding a payment solution where few people have credit cards or delivering parcels where there are no proper roads or postal codes.“It’s probably hard for the Silicon Valley innovator to think about those issues specifically,” Li said.While much of Sea’s expansion is in Asian markets like Indonesia, Li also thinks the company has an advantage in Brazil, where Shopee has had success since launching in 2019. With its 214 million population and decent per-capita income, he thinks the country is Sea’s most promising growth market.“We spent a lot of money when capital was relatively cheap and available, and it’s kind of an almost 10-year effort,” Li said of Brazil.Read more about Li, who named himself after Forrest GumpThese days, Li says he’s splitting his time between Singapore and California to stay close to the “mind-blowing” artificial intelligence revolution that’s taking place in Silicon Valley. He believes AI will play a big role in replacing much of the repetitive work for Sea’s e-commerce, gaming and fintech businesses. Gaming, in particular, is probably ahead of online shopping in terms of how people use AI to develop and play games by making it more interactive and immersive, he said.As the interview at Sea’s headquarters winds down, Li is asked whether company will be able to keep turning a profit every quarter. He cocked his head to the side and, with a laugh, said he can’t reveal too much since Sea is in a quiet period ahead of first-quarter results on May 16.But that’s not really the point, he added. The key thing is that Sea has been able to demonstrate for employees and investors that it can reach breakeven when it has to. So now, it can calibrate growth and profit depending on strategic priorities.“The numbers show that the destiny is in our own hands,” he said. “We sleep very well now.”--With assistance from Olivia Poh and Tao Zhang.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekSweetgreen Tests Robots to Make Faster, More Efficient Sad Desk SaladsThe Green Energy Transition Has a Chilean Copper ProblemBrew Another Pot, Robinhood’s 24-Hour Stock Trading Is HereEric Adams Is Starving New York City’s Universal Pre-K ProgramRecession Calls Keep Getting Pushed Back, Giving Soft Landing Believers Hope©2023 Bloomberg L.P.","May 14, 2023 at 6:30 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sea-path-profit-paved-layoffs-233000711.html,Bloomberg,-0.03333333333333333,0.0,0.14206950456950457,0.41182751507751525,2023-05-14 18:30:00,2023-05-14 18:30:00,,,

AMZN,Billionaire Ken Fishers Top 10 Stock Picks,"Our MethodologyFor this article we picked the top 10 stocks from Ken Fisher's hedge fund portfolio for the first quarter of 2023.Fisher Asset Management’s Holdings: $2,346,771,000 Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is the world's largest chip manufacturer.Like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is one of the top stock picks of billionaire Ken Fisher.“Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) contributed to performance as revenues grew +27% (in USD) from the year ago quarter. Despite this strength, the Company’s customers have seen near-term weakness in demand due to Covid-19 normalization as well as the launch timing of new products. However, the Company is well-positioned to continue a long-term growth trajectory because its leading-edge capacity is being absorbed by high-performance computing applications, particularly at nontraditional integrated circuit (IC) design houses, such as Apple, Alphabet and Amazon, which have become IC-design powerhouses over the past decade. Importantly, the Company’s aggressive investment in leading-edge equipment, tight development with fabless IC designers, and embrace of open development libraries, should continue to foster a superior competitive position and attractive long-term growth.”Fisher Asset Management’s Holdings: $2,478,511,000 The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) is a leading home improvement retailer with over 2,300 stores and a strong omnichannel network.Fisher Asset Management started building its position in The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) in the first quarter of 2012 and, in the first quarter of 2023, holds over 8.40 million shares in the company, valued at $2.49 billion. The company represents 1.5% of the hedge fund’s 13F portfolio.“The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) provided an update on reducing the environmental impact of its stores. Since 2010, the company has reduced U.S. store electricity use by 50% by implementing LED lighting across all of its stores, buying electricity from large-scale commercial solar farms, and installing rooftop solar farms. The company is now applying its experience to other parts of its operations, including reducing electricity use in its supply chain and water use in store irrigation. Home Depot was also recognized by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for being one of the nation’s largest green power users.”Fisher Asset Management’s Holdings: $2,579,321,000 Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is a semiconductor company that makes chips for various applications, including PCs, gaming, cloud services, and automotive.On May 3, Truist analyst William Stein increased Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)'s price target to $84 from $79, but maintained a ‘Hold’ rating on the stock. Despite the company's revenue exceeding expectations due to the upside in Gaming and Embedded segments, the analyst is concerned about AMD's weaker Q2 guidance and increasing investments in AI.Fisher's hedge fund also strengthened its position in Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) by buying 431,867 additional shares in Q1.“Last quarter we added Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) to the portfolio at 18x earnings and quickly made it into a top 5 position. At that time, Mr. Market was worried about earnings revisions for semiconductor stocks. In Q1 2023, it has been one of our best performing positions with the stock up 50%! In just three months, the market realized that Artificial Intelligence (AI) and related technologies require a lot of semiconductors. Mr. Market really is manic depressive but this volatility can give the enterprising investor just enough of a window to pick stocks with attractive risk rewards.”Fisher Asset Management’s Holdings: $2,798,969,000 Percentage of Fisher Asset Management’s Portfolio: 1.69%NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides graphics, compute, and networking solutions globally.Ken Fisher is also bullish on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) as of the end of the first quarter of 2023. His fund increased its holding in NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) by 1% in the first quarter, ending the period with over 10.08 million shares of the company.“NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a semiconductor mega-cap company and global leader in gaming cards and accelerated computing hardware and software. Shares of NVIDIA rose over 90% during the first quarter because of material developments in generative AI evidenced by the release of ChatGPT and other competitive models. On its fourth quarter fiscal 2023 earnings call on February 22, Colette Kress, NVIDIA’s CFO said, “AI adoption is at an inflection point.… The opportunity is significant and driving strong growth in data center that will accelerate through the year.” On the same call, Jensen Huang, NVIDIA’s CEO emphasized: “The accumulation of technology breakthroughs has brought AI to an inflection point. Generative AI’s versatility and capability has triggered a sense of urgency at enterprises around the world to develop and deploy AI strategies.… NVIDIA AI is essentially the operating system of AI systems today.… The activity around AI infrastructures…has just gone through the roof in the last 60 days. And so there’s no question that whatever our views [were] of this year as we enter[ed] this year has fairly dramatically changed as a result over the last 60, 90 days.” Indeed, our research indicates that shortages of NVIDIA GPUs3 are the biggest gating factor for AI adoption and that about 90% of AI-model training runs are performed on their GPUs. During its annual GTC conference4 in March, NVIDIA announced new products and services that expand its addressable market and together form a full AI computing platform. These included: (1) new AI training systems (where it is dominant) and inferencing systems (where the field is more wide open), such as specialized chips in the areas of large language models and recommender systems, simulation and graphics rendering, and video use cases; (2) new fully managed AI services in partnership with the major cloud service providers, called NVIDIA DGX Cloud and NVDIA Omniverse Cloud; (3) new domain-specific generative AI foundational models, branded NVIDIA AI Foundations, which NVIDIA customers can harness to build and train custom language models with their own proprietary data to develop differentiated offerings; and (4) industry-specific accelerator libraries, spanning such diverse verticals as genomics analysis and computational lithography. We continue to believe NVIDIA’s end-to-end AI platform and leading market share in gaming, data centers, and robotics (including automotive), along with the size of these markets, will enable the company to drive durable growth for years to come.”Fisher Asset Management’s Holdings: $2,801,441,000 Percentage of Fisher Asset Management’s Portfolio: 1.69%Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) provides global Customer Relationship Management (CRM) technology.Along with Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) is one of the top stocks on the radar of billionaire Ken Fisher.“Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) was a material contributor during the quarter. The company has taken numerous positive steps to increase profitability more quickly than expected. Salesforce also improved its corporate governance by recommending three new board members. The company is focused on improving margins, deemphasizing acquisitions, and has expanded its stock buyback plan from $10 billion to $20 billion. We believe Salesforce can pursue these opportunities while continuing to increase its competitive position.”  Suggested articles:12 Best Information Technology Services Stocks to Buy16 Most Profitable Value Stocks Now12 Best Household and Personal Care Stocks To Buy","May 14, 2023 at 6:15 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/billionaire-ken-fisher-top-10-231527952.html,Insider Monkey,0.5,0.5,0.193179788961039,0.45081980519480497,2023-05-14 18:15:00,2023-05-14 18:15:00,,,
AMZN,Whole Foods vs. Trader Joes Which Store Is Better for Your Money?,"Known for its expensive brand selection -- it earned the nickname ""Whole Paycheck"" for its outrageous prices -- Whole Foods hoped to shed that reputation following its acquisition by Amazon in 2017.But there is a cheaper alternative: Trader Joe's.Trader Joe's business model of selling hard-to-find items without charging suppliers a shelf fee is a part of what makes its selections so affordable. The company buys directly from suppliers, and in volume, which also helps lower costs.You won't find as many organic fruits and vegetables at Trader Joe's as you would at Whole Foods, but you will find better savings.For example, at Trader Joe's, it would cost about $17 to buy all of the following:1 pound of organic baby carrots10 ounces of organic cherry tomatoes1 pound of bananas3 pounds of apples5 ounces of spring mixTo buy the same items in the same quantities at Whole Foods, the cost would be at least $25.Generally, non-organic produce at Trader Joe's is significantly cheaper than at Whole Foods. For example, you can get 11 ounces of blueberries for $3.99 at Trader Joe's, but at Whole Foods, you'll spend a bit more for a pint of blueberries at $5.99.Beef isn't considered bargain meat, especially the organic variety. You'll pay $9.99 at Whole Foods for a pound of organic, grass-fed ground beef. Whereas Trader Joe's store brand organic, grass-fed ground beef is just $7.49 per pound.If your next recipe calls for some organic chicken breast you'll want to head to Trader Joe's once again. A pound of chicken breast there costs $6.99 per pound. It will cost you an extra dollar per pound at Whole Foods at $10.99.A half gallon of low-fat milk at Whole Foods costs $5.49 and the same product will cost you $4.49 Trader Joe's. You can snag a half gallon of soy milk at both retailers for $2.99.Once a little-known grain-like seed, quinoa now is touted as a superfood and has become almost commonplace. If you're a fan of it, stock up at Trader Joe's, where it sells for $2 less than at Whole Foods.However, pasta costs a bit more at Trader Joe's than at Whole Foods -- $2.99 will get you 16 ounces of brown rice and quinoa spaghetti versus $1.09 for a bag of spaghetti at Whole Foods. But, if you prefer your pasta with sauce, you'll still pay 20 cents less for a 25-ounce jar of organic marinara at Trader Joe's versus Whole Foods. Trader Joe's marinara sauce sells for $2.49 whereas the Whole Foods 365 brand equivalent sells for $2.69.Cheese aficionados might know that Trader Joe's takes the wheel when it comes to cheese prices. A block of sharp cheddar cheese is $3.79 at Whole Foods, while it's a only $2.99 at Trader Joe's. And when it comes to shredded parmesan, Trader Joe's has more bang for your buck as a 12-ounce pack is $5.49 compared to $3.99 for a much smaller 5-ounce bag at Whole Foods.Breakfast is the most important meal of the day. Savings are just as important, and you'll know you've started your day by saving money if you eat Trader Joe's organic breakfast items. An 18-ounce package of store brand old fashioned organic oats costs $2.99 at Trader Joe's versus $3.79 for the 365 brand at Whole Foods.If you prefer cereal, you can get a 10-ounce bag of organic fruit and seed granola at Trader Joe's for $3.99. At Whole Foods, you'll pay $5.49 for a 17-ounce box of fruit and nut granola, which makes it the better deal proportion-wise.If you prefer organic, fair trade coffee, you'll pay $8.99 for a 13-ounce canister of it at Trader Joe's. At Whole Foods, you can buy 24 ounces of their brand, Pacific Rim roast, for $13.99, which might make that the better deal if you go through several cups of coffee every day. Both are cheaper deals, at any rate, than what you could buy at Starbucks.Fresh fruits and veggies tend to spoil quickly and could potentially hurt your pockets in the long run, so opting for frozen produce can be the best option if you're trying to save money and eat healthily. For a bag of frozen organic spinach, you'll spend $2.99 at Whole Foods but at Trader Joe's organic spinach is only $1.99 per 16 ounces.Organic strawberries cost much less at Trader Joe's than at Whole Foods -- $5.99 will get you a 16-ounce pack versus $8.99 at Whole Foods for the same amount.You've succumbed again to the insurmountable shift in gravity that happens when you get home from work that makes cooking dinner for the night impossible. So, the next logical step? You grab something quick and easy, like a frozen pizza.At Trader Joe's, a crusty cheese pizza is $5.99 but the same type of pizza at Whole Foods costs $4.79. If you're a pepperoni lover, both stores list their pepperoni pizzas at $4.99.If pizza isn't your thing, both stores carry already-made frozen tamales.

For 32 ounces of organic cane sugar, the price is $3.49 at Trader Joe's versus $4.49 at Whole Foods for the same amount.However, Whole Foods has bulk options on other sweeteners. You can get 23.5 ounces of raw agave nectar for $6.49 whereas you'll be paying $3.79 at Trader Joe's for 11.75 ounces. On the other hand, Trader Joe's carries 16 ounces of honey for $5.49, but Whole Foods sells its 365 brand for $5.69 for 12 ounces.Paper towels and toilet paper are everyday essentials that can add up over time.

Trader Joe's brand offers the same product for only $5.99.As for paper towels, a three-count package of recycled paper towel rolls goes for $5.49 at Whole Foods. And although Trader Joe's paper towels are not recycled, the cost is a bit cheaper -- $4.49 for three rolls.A 12-ounce package of gluten-free organic yellow lentil and brown rice spaghetti is $3.29 at Trader Joe's, while the smaller-sized 12-ounce package of gluten-free spaghetti at Whole Foods costs $2.99.Both stores also carry gluten-free pancake mix.

Whole Foods has a 24-oune bag of gluten-free pancake mix for $4.89.More From GOBankingRatesWhy Stealth Wealth Is the Best Way To Handle Your MoneyGot a Question About Money?

AMZN,4 Reasons You Should Cancel Amazon Prime,"At the beginning of 2022, the cost of Amazon Prime was $119 annually. The price increase for Prime membership plans went into effect on Feb. 18, 2022. The increase to $139 was a 15% increase over the previous price.While there is no confirmed statement or upcoming plans regarding another price hike on Prime, it is possible Amazon could increase prices again. Members who cancel now would be able to pocket $139 in savings immediately on membership fees.If you find most of your shopping purchases are made through Amazon, you may be less likely to cancel your membership. This is especially true of households that depend on the free two-day delivery or two-hour grocery delivery services.However, if you rarely shop at Amazon or your spending habits have changed significantly, you’re not likely to be getting your money’s worth in keeping the membership.Amazon Prime members receive access to Prime Video, Prime Gaming, Prime Music and access to Kindle Owners’ Lending Library. These are all perks of Prime — if you’re using them, of course.Maybe you subscribe to other streaming services for movies, TV and music. You might have a separate gaming console you love. Or you enjoy visiting the library to check out physical books and e-books. If you find you can easily live without these additional entertainment perks, it may be easier to cancel Amazon Prime.Some members of Amazon Prime may appreciate the swift way the service provides deliveries of groceries via Amazon Fresh or using the Amazon Pharmacy service.However, savvy shoppers may be focusing on other retailers and supermarkets where they can get even better deals.A frequent Costco or Sam’s Club shopper, for example, may be less inclined to give up their annual membership to these warehouse clubs or the benefits that come with these memberships. Shoppers at grocers like Aldi may enjoy the breadth of savings available to them while those who shop at Target can receive access to price-matching options. Still, other shoppers may wish to shop local and support small businesses in their communities. And some consumers may have different pharmacy preferences or visit a local pharmacist they have been with for a long time.Ultimately, Prime members need to weigh whether they’re getting a better deal with Prime versus other retailers.If you have decided a Prime membership no longer meets your needs, you can easily end it.Instructions on Amazon.com state members may go to their Prime membership account and select update, cancel and more options. Follow the on-screen instructions and you’ll be able to cancel Amazon Prime.More From GOBankingRates5 Expensive Renovations Homeowners Always RegretFinancial Insight in Your Inbox: Sign Up for GBR's Daily Newsletter3 Ways to Recession Proof Your Retirement7 Things You Must Do To Create a Plan for Your Money","May 13, 2023 at 8:00 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-reasons-cancel-amazon-prime-200113427.html,GOBankingRates,0.0,0.0,0.15117623604465708,0.5026629072681704,2023-05-13 08:00:00,2023-05-13 08:00:00,,,

NVDA,Artificial intelligence gives real boost to U.S. stock market,"By Lewis KrauskopfNEW YORK (Reuters) - Recent advances in artificial intelligence are fueling optimism over how businesses can operate more productively in the years ahead. They are also providing a big boost to the stock market.The S&P 500's 9% rally this year has been driven by a handful of the index's biggest stocks, a number of which are at the center of the AI frenzy that has spread in the wake of the chatbot sensation ChatGPT.Five stocks - Microsoft, Google parent Alphabet, Nvidia, Apple and Meta Platforms - are responsible for the S&P 500's entire year-to-date return, said Jessica Rabe, co-founder of DataTrek Research. About 25% to 50% of those gains are owed to ""the buzz around artificial intelligence,"" she noted.A recent Societe Generale analysis zeroed in on 20 stocks widely owned by AI-related exchange-traded funds, whose overall assets under management have grown almost 40% this year.Removing those stocks from the S&P 500 would reduce the index's performance by roughly 10 percentage points, putting stocks in negative territory for the year, SocGen's analysis showed.""It's the AI-driven stocks that are getting the strongest returns,"" said Manish Kabra, head of US equity strategy at SocGen. ""As a secular theme, for sure, it's attractive.""The rush of AI developments has analysts licking their lips at the profit potential stemming from new revenue opportunities and productivity improvements.Goldman Sachs strategists estimate that generative AI could create productivity gains that result in S&P 500 companies expanding profit margins by about 4 percentage points in a decade following widespread adoption.Indeed, optimism over AI is a key factor supporting a stock market facing numerous headwinds. Those include uncertainty over the U.S. Congress coming to agreement to raise the debt ceiling and avoid a default, and worries the economy may be on the verge of a downturn, as the Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes filter through the economy.""We are strongly of the view that AI will change the world,"" Jim Reid, strategist at Deutsche Bank, said in a note titled, ""Will ChatGPT prevent the US recession?""The AI excitement has helped propel hefty gains for some stocks. For example, shares of Microsoft, the second-largest U.S. company by market value, have climbed 32% this year. The software giant has grabbed headlines with its partnership with ChatGPT creator OpenAI and sprucing up its Bing search engine with AI.Shares of Nvidia, the fifth-biggest U.S. company by market value whose chips are central in the AI excitement, have soared 110% this year.The Global X Robotics & Artificial Intelligence ETF has jumped nearly 30% this year.Investors next week will be keeping an eye on developments regarding the U.S. debt ceiling, as well as inflation data and corporate earnings including results from Nvidia.Other factors have supported megacap stocks. Those include a decline in Treasury yields from last year's highs that has soothed concerns over tech valuations and investors viewing megacaps as safety plays in an uncertain environment.At the same time, even the shares of potentially transformative technologies are vulnerable to price bubbles, as history shows. A dotcom stock mania helped markets roar higher in the late 1990s, but a crash followed a few years later, leaving only a handful of internet names standing.A BofA Global Research report published Friday said AI stocks were in a ""baby bubble"" in comparison with far larger asset price moves seen in areas such as internet stocks and bitcoin over the last few decades.Nonetheless, many investors say that AI is no fad.King Lip, chief strategist at Baker Avenue Wealth Management in San Francisco, calls the developments in AI a ""game changer."" His firm owns shares of Microsoft, Nvidia and Alphabet.""It goes beyond the next shiny object,"" Lip said. ""The path is pretty clear on how generative AI can lead to earnings growth for these companies.""(Reporting by Lewis Krauskopf; Editing by Ira Iosebashvili and Richard Chang)","May 19, 2023 at 11:38 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/artificial-intelligence-gives-real-boost-163808896.html,Reuters,-0.19999999999999998,0.65,-0.0016060606060606046,0.4578686868686869,2023-05-19 11:38:00,2023-05-19 11:38:00,304.1000061035156,312.6400146484375,-8.540008544921875

NVDA,NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,"Shares of this maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence have returned +16.9% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.2% change. The Zacks Semiconductor - General industry, to which Nvidia belongs, has gained 7.5% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Nvidia is expected to post earnings of $0.92 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -32.4%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.3%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.52 points to a change of +35.3% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.6%.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.03 indicates a change of +33.5% from what Nvidia is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.9%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Nvidia is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Nvidia, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $6.51 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -21.5%. For the current and next fiscal years, $29.77 billion and $37.42 billion estimates indicate +10.4% and +25.7% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryNvidia reported revenues of $6.05 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -20.8%. EPS of $0.88 for the same period compares with $1.32 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.01 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.61%. The EPS surprise was +8.64%.Over the last four quarters, Nvidia surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Nvidia is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Nvidia. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) : Free Stock Analysis ReportTo read this article on Zacks.com click here.Zacks Investment Research","May 19, 2023 at 8:00 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-corporation-nvda-attracting-investor-130001241.html,Zacks,0.0,0.0,0.10192307692307692,0.4912240537240534,2023-05-19 08:00:00,2023-05-19 08:00:00,304.1000061035156,312.6400146484375,-8.540008544921875
NVDA,Weak Gaming Chip Demand to Hurt NVIDIA's (NVDA) Q1 Earnings,"NVIDIA impressed investors with its stellar financial performance and experienced robust top-and-bottom-line growth in the past several quarters. However, the weakening demand for its chips used in the gaming end market put a break in its growth momentum, as depicted in the last three reported quarters.In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, though NVIDIA’s revenues of $6.05 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.01 billion, revenues came 21% lower than the year-ago quarter. The decline was primarily due to continued weakness across its Gaming and Professional Visualization market segments.Lower data center demand in China also hurt the top line in the reported quarter. Moreover, non-GAAP earnings plunged 33% year over year to 88 cents per share. The trend is likely to have continued in the first quarter of fiscal 2024.NVIDIA Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseNVIDIA Corporation price-eps-surprise | NVIDIA Corporation QuoteNVIDIA experienced robust sales for its chips used in gaming end markets for the past couple of years. This was driven by pandemic-induced stay-at-home instructions.The demand for NVIDIA’s gaming chips increased immensely as people were surfing games to stay engaged and entertained indoors during lockdowns. Moreover, with the massive emergence of multiplayer online games and Gaming-as-a-Service concepts, the demand for graphic processing units shot up exponentially.However, the reopening of economies, along with the rising global slowdown concern amid the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war and the U.S.-China trade war, has been hurting the demand for gaming chips.NVDA’s revenues from the Gaming market platform plunged 46% year over year in the last reported quarter. The year-over-year decline was primarily due to a lower sell-in of Gaming products. This reflected a reduction in channel partner inventory levels amid weak demand due to macroeconomic headwinds and pandemic-related issues in China, which weighed on consumer demand.We believe that the trend is likely to have continued in the first quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Gaming segment’s revenues is pegged at $1.95 billion, indicating a 46% decline from the year-ago quarter’s revenues of $3.62 billion.NVIDIA currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Shares of NVDA have soared 116.8% year to date (YTD).The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Meta's second-quarter 2023 earnings has been revised 43 cents northward to $2.87 per share in the past 30 days.

NVDA,Skechers and The Mosaic Company have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,"Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:Skechers designs, develops and markets lifestyle and performance footwear, apparel and accessories for men, women and children. Its collections are available in 180 countries and territories through department and specialty stores, online, and at over 4,500 company, and third-party-owned, physical retail stores.On Apr 27, 2023, Skechers reported its first quarter 2023 results and crushed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by $0.41. It reported earnings of $1.02 versus the consensus of $0.61.It was the third beat in the last four quarters.Quarterly sales were a record, up 10% to $2 billion from $1.81 billion last year. Skechers saw broad strength in most markets globally, including regional sales improvements of 21% in both EMEA and APAC, which includes 3% growth in China.Direct-to-Consumer increased 24.5% worldwide due to improved inventory availability in stores and strong demand for its new comfort product offering.Gross margins expanded by 360 basis points to 48.9% from 45.3% last year.Inventory, which has been the bane of many retailers, fell 17.4%, or $315.8 million, to $1.5 billion from Dec 31, 2022. Inventory levels decreased in AMER, EMEA and APAC.Skechers gave 2023 earnings guidance of between $3.00 to $3.20.The analysts had been too conservative. Business is hotter than they thought. 8 estimates for 2023 have been revised higher in the last 30 days. The Zacks Consensus has jumped to $3.14 from $2.93, which is in the higher end of the company's guidance range.This is earnings growth of 31.9% over last year as the company made just $2.38.The analysts are also bullish about 2024, with 7 estimates revised higher for next year too in the last month. The 2024 Zacks Consensus Estimate has jumped to $3.78 from $3.63. That's another 20.3% growth.It's been a wild ride for Skechers shares. They performed well during the pandemic and hit new highs in summer of 2021 before selling off the next 12 months.But in the last year, the shares are up 41.3% and are back to those 2021 5-year highs.It's still attractively valued, with a forward P/E of 17.1.Skechers doesn't pay a dividend, but it does have a share repurchase program. During the first quarter Skechers repurchased $30 million in shares. As of Mar 31, 2023, it had approximately $395.7 million remaining in the program.If you're looking for a global retailer that has growth and is still a value, Skechers should be on your short list.The Mosaic Company, headquartered in Tampa, FL, is one of the world's leading producers and marketers of concentrated phosphate and potash crop nutrients. It supplies phosphates and potash fertilizers and feed ingredients for the global agriculture industry.On May 3, Mosaic reported its first quarter 2023 earnings and it reported earnings of $1.14 which was a miss of 10.9%, or $0.14. The Zacks Consensus was looking for $1.28.It was the fifth earnings miss in a row.Revenue fell 8% to $3.6 billion reflecting the impact of lower prices which were somewhat offset by higher volumes.In its three big categories, volumes were higher in 2023 than in 2022. In Potash, sales volume million tonnes was 1.9 compared to 1.8 last year. In Phosphate, sales volume million tonnes was 1.8 compared to 1.7 last year and in Mosaic Fertilizantes sales volume million tonnes was 2.1 compared to 1.8.But it was the opposite in sales price.Potash MOP Selling Price fell to $421 from $582 last year. Phosphate DAP Selling Price fell to $660 from $785. Mosaic Fertilizantes finished product selling price was $646, down from $817.Gross margins fell to 18.6% from 36.7% last year.The analysts have been aggressively cutting their earnings estimates for 2023 and 2024 the last 3 months as fertilizer prices have softened.For 2023, 4 have cut the last 30 days and 1 in just the last week. The 2023 Zacks Consensus Estimate has plunged to $5.05 from $8.45 in just the last 3 months.That's an earnings decline of 54% from 2022, when it made $11.01.The cuts extend into 2024 as well. 5 estimates were cut in the last month for 2024 pushing the Zacks Consensus down to $4.02 from $5.48 just 3 months before.That's another 20.4% drop.To counter all that analyst bearishness, which is the reason the stock is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is the company's industry outlook.It expects the grain and oilseed markets to remain tight through 2023 and beyond. Mosaic said in North America, sentiment has improved ""significantly"" compared to the second half of 2022.Mosaic also said spring nutrient application rates were trending toward normal levels. And for both potash and phosphates, supply constraints remain.But until earnings turn around and get raised, instead of cut, investors have decided to flee the stock. Year-to-date, shares are down 18.4%, but over the last year shares have fallen 45.5%.It's dirt cheap, even with the earnings cuts. It's trading with a forward P/E of just 7.Mosaic is also generating plenty of free cash flow. Mosaic is standing by its 2023 Capital Allocation Strategy, which is to return largely all of the 2023 free cash flow back to shareholders.In the first quarter, that meant $608 million was returned through share repurchases and dividends. It's dividend is currently yielding 2.3%.Fertilizers are a commodity. It's a challenging industry in which to invest. For investors interested in the fertilizers, and Mosaic, you may want to wait until the Zacks Rank moves higher. Keep Mosaic on your watch list.For the fiscal first quarter, the company expects revenues of $6.5 billion (+/-2%). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $6.51 billion, indicating a 21.5% decline from the year-ago reported figure.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly earnings is pegged at 92 cents per share. This suggests a year-over-year decline of 32.4%.The company's earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate twice in the preceding four quarters while missing the same on two occasions, the average surprise being -3.2%.Let's see how things have shaped up before the announcement.NVIDIA's first-quarter performance is likely to have benefited from the recovery across its Gaming and Professional Visualization end markets. The Gaming end market's last quarter results had shown early signs of recovery as inventory with channel partners reached normal levels. The company also registered strong demand across most regions for its gaming products.Revenues from the Gaming end market increased 16% sequentially in the last reported quarter. NVIDIA's Professional Visualization segment performance also reflected recovery, with revenues increasing 13% sequentially. We believe that the trend is likely to have continued in the first quarter for both end markets.Moreover, the continued strength of its Datacenter business on the growing adoption of cloud-based solutions amid the growing hybrid working trend is expected to have boosted NVDA's first-quarter revenues. An increase in Hyperscale demand and growing adoption in the inference market are likely to have been tailwinds in the to-be-reported quarter.Further, the company's Automotive segment showed an improvement in trends in five of the last seven quarters. The positive trend is likely to have continued in the fiscal first quarter, mainly due to increasing investments in self-driving and artificial intelligence cockpit solutions.However, we opine that ongoing macroeconomic headwinds, like high inflation and interest rates, are likely to have continued to hurt the sales of NVIDIA's desktop workstation GPUs in the first quarter. Additionally, disruptions in retail channel sales due to travel restrictions and social-distancing measures implemented across several parts of China might have weighed on the overall financial performance in the fiscal first quarter.Our proven model predicts an earnings beat for NVDA this earnings season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat, which is the case here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for HPQ's second-quarter earnings is pegged at 76 cents per share, suggesting a decline of 29.6% from the year-ago quarter's earnings of $1.11. HP's quarterly revenues are estimated to decrease 20.7% year over year to $13.07 billion.NetApp carries a Zacks Rank #3 and has an Earnings ESP of +0.22%. The company is slated to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2025 results on May 31. Its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 9%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NTAP's fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.35 per share, indicating a year-over-year decline of 4.9%. The consensus mark for revenues stands at $1.55 billion, suggesting a year-over-year drop of 7.8%.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

NVDA,"Nvidia, AMD, Micron lead chip sector higher with AI, Japan in focus","(Reuters) - Shares in Nvdia Corp, Advanced Micro Devices and Micron Technology on Thursday provided the biggest boosts to the chip sector, which outperformed the broader market as investors looked for ways to invest in artificial intelligence and in Japan.Shares in chip design software company Synopsys shares ended up 8.7% after it forecast better-than-expected third-quarter profit estimates, saying increased use of AI and automation boosted its business.Nvidia shares were up 5.0%, while the Philadelphia semiconductor index gained 3.2%.Micron's shares climbed 4.1% after announcing it would invest up to 500 billion yen ($3.70 billion) in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) technology in Japan in the next few years with Japanese government support.Japan's President Fumio Kishida asked executives from companies, such as Micron, Intel Corp and Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC), to invest in Japan ahead of a three-day Group of Seven (G7) summit in Hiroshima, where member countries will discuss what they see as China's economically coercive policies and its accumulation of sensitive technology.Kim Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners in Pittsburgh put Thursday's rally down to continued investor interest in the emergence of artificial intelligence as the hottest new technology, more so than the news from Japan.""While it's encouraging that companies and countries are working together to expand capacity, for investors when companies are building new plants, it's generally not rewarding in the short term because that's where all the free cash flow goes,"" said Forrest.The money manager, who also cited Synopsys results as a positive sign for the chip sector, however, noted that investors see chips as the part of the AI story they can buy into today as ""there's no one company you can buy that's the lynchpin"" for AI.AMD shares were up 4.0% while Intel added 2.8%.

NVDA,Billionaire David Teppers 2023 Portfolio: Top 15 Stock Picks,"After a tumultuous 2022 and a start to 2023 that saw markets focus on whether the Federal Reserve would finally end its interest rate hiking cycle and if this would cause a recession, over the past couple of months a new complication has made its way into the financial markets. This is the U.S. debt ceiling, and it sits right at the heart of the American economy and by extension, the global economy. The debt ceiling is decided by Congress, and it serves as a check for the executive branch - or the Treasury Department under the President - to limit the amount of money that it can borrow to meet debt repayments.The back and forth between the president and Congress for this ceiling has often created turmoil in the financial market. In fact, this tussle also caused S&P Global Ratings to downgrade U.S. government debt to AA+ from AAA in 2011 - the first and only time in history that America received a downgrade which is often reserved for developing countries with fiscal mismanagement. The impact of this downgrade on the stock markets was immediate, with all major indexes declining by as much as seven percent in the aftermath.Our Methodology Appaloosa Management's Q1 2023 Investment: $31 million Tesla, Inc.

This suggests a year-over-year decline of 32.4%.The company’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate twice in the preceding four quarters while missing the same on two occasions, the average surprise being -3.2%.Let’s see how things have shaped up before the announcement.NVIDIA Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseNVIDIA Corporation price-eps-surprise | NVIDIA Corporation QuoteNVIDIA’s first-quarter performance is likely to have benefited from the recovery across its Gaming and Professional Visualization end markets. The Gaming end market’s last quarter results had shown early signs of recovery as inventory with channel partners reached normal levels. The company also registered strong demand across most regions for its gaming products.Revenues from the Gaming end market increased 16% sequentially in the last reported quarter. NVIDIA’s Professional Visualization segment performance also reflected recovery, with revenues increasing 13% sequentially. We believe that the trend is likely to have continued in the first quarter for both end markets.Moreover, the continued strength of its Datacenter business on the growing adoption of cloud-based solutions amid the growing hybrid working trend is expected to have boosted NVDA’s first-quarter revenues. An increase in Hyperscale demand and growing adoption in the inference market are likely to have been tailwinds in the to-be-reported quarter.Further, the company’s Automotive segment showed an improvement in trends in five of the last seven quarters. The positive trend is likely to have continued in the fiscal first quarter, mainly due to increasing investments in self-driving and artificial intelligence cockpit solutions.However, we opine that ongoing macroeconomic headwinds, like high inflation and interest rates, are likely to have continued to hurt the sales of NVIDIA’s desktop workstation GPUs in the first quarter. Additionally, disruptions in retail channel sales due to travel restrictions and social-distancing measures implemented across several parts of China might have weighed on the overall financial performance in the fiscal first quarter.Our proven model predicts an earnings beat for NVDA this earnings season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat, which is the case here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for HPQ’s second-quarter earnings is pegged at 76 cents per share, suggesting a decline of 29.6% from the year-ago quarter’s earnings of $1.11. HP’s quarterly revenues are estimated to decrease 20.7% year over year to $13.07 billion.Agilent carries a Zacks Rank #3 and has an Earnings ESP of +0.40%. The company is scheduled to report second-quarter fiscal 2023 results on May 23. Its earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the preceding four quarters, with the average surprise being 7%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Agilent’s second-quarter earnings stands at $1.27 per share, implying a year-over-year increase of 12.4%. It is estimated to report revenues of $1.67 billion, which suggests an increase of approximately 3.8% from the year-ago quarter.NetApp carries a Zacks Rank #3 and has an Earnings ESP of +0.22%. The company is slated to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2025 results on May 31. Its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 9%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NTAP’s fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.35 per share, indicating a year-over-year decline of 4.9%. The consensus mark for revenues stands at $1.55 billion, suggesting a year-over-year drop of 7.8%.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.HP Inc.

(Operator Instructions). Today's call will last 1 hour. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Trey Campbell, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.Trey CampbellAart J. de GeusShelagh GlaserOperator(Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.Harlan SurAart J. de GeusHarlan SurAnd then as the team had anticipated on the last earnings call, you're demonstrating it with your guide on this call, right, you've seen a strong step-up in the second half. I think it's roughly about 11% half-on-half growth. And on a year-over-year basis, I think second half is going to be up like 20% plus. I know the team talked about second half weighting on renewal activity and also more IP consumption given the timing of some of your customers' design programs. IP was down slightly year-over-year in the first half. Is the team still anticipating half-to-half and year-over-year step up in IP for the second half?Aart J. de GeusShelagh GlaserYes. And I would just add, Harlan, I mean our teams are deeply embedded in the design team. So we have a really good understanding of where they are in terms of their needs from us, specifically on the IP side, which is set for a strong second half, which is traditional like Aart said.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Joe Vruwink with Baird.Joseph D. VruwinkAart J. de GeusJoseph D. VruwinkOkay. That's great. And then a question on your verification hardware business. As I think about your nonrecurring revenues and the growth there over time. I mean you've sustained just a very high CAGR in that business. And yet when I think about the demand for verification, sometimes it's been in GEO's that are building out a semiconductor supply chain. Sometimes it's new companies, I think about like China being down year-on-year and yet, it looked like your hardware business grew. So is the nature of growth in your verification business maybe coming from different sources than might have been the case in years past?Aart J. de GeusShelagh GlaserYes. And I would just share, we had shared that 2022 was a record hardware year. We expect '23 to be another record hardware year. So as Aart said, the demand is very strong across our customer base.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Jason Celino with KeyBanc.Jason Vincent CelinoAart, I appreciate all your comments about mapping the year appropriately and seeing fitting the pattern that you had planned. But when I look at the quarter, the beat was still nice and suggest that something must have come in better than expected. Can you just elaborate where you exactly saw the strength and the upside?Aart J. de GeusJason Vincent CelinoOkay. Perfect. And then I did have an AI question, but it's actually for your security business. We've seen some examples of AI being used to write code and even test and (inaudible). How do you think this may augment or evolve processes for developers going forward?Aart J. de GeusOperatorYour next question comes from the line of Gary Mobley with Wells Fargo.Gary Wade MobleyAart J. de GeusGary Wade MobleyAnd this may be a question more for Shelagh. But I appreciate the fact that your first half IP business is they've seen the tough year-ago comp and thus the minor increase -- or excuse me, decrease in the revenue. But what's driving the profitability headwind? If I'm not mistaken, there's a 10 to 12 percentage point degradation in the op margin. Is that mix related? Or are there some other factors factoring in there?Shelagh GlaserOperatorYour next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America.Vivek AryaAart, you mentioned the adoption of multi-die designs. And I'm curious, what percentage of chip design starts do you think are in this multi-die architecture? And where do you see that going? And is there a way to quantify the benefit to Synopsys in that position?Aart J. de GeusVivek AryaShelagh GlaserWell, I would start with we're very committed to both short-term and long-term margin expansion. And short term, what's driving it is we're putting in some more rigorous financial control. So as we work through these great opportunities that Aart painted for us, how do we make sure that we properly scale ourselves. So that's really the improvement that we're putting forward the greater than 150 basis points, and we're committed to continuing to long-term improve margin.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Charles Shi with Needham.Yu ShiAart J. de GeusYu ShiAart J. de GeusWell, in order to deliver the results that we're guiding you to, you need to really see growth everywhere. And I think Shelagh already stated that IP is truly very lumpy. And I forget the exact comparison versus a year ago, but IP definitely has to contribute and will contribute in the second half to get to the numbers. But EDA is, of course, more ratable. And so there, we have a good assessment of the situation. So fundamentally, I think all cylinders will do well in the second half.Shelagh GlaserYes. And I mean, obviously, the trend of first half, second half is more traditionally what we see. Last year was a little bit unusual and then a very balanced first half and second half. But we do expect growth across the businesses, and we do expect particular growth in our IP business.OperatorYou next question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin.Jay VleeschhouwerAart J. de GeusJay VleeschhouwerShelagh GlaserSo we do expect this to be another record revenue year, and we're actually grateful to be able to build some inventory because we hadn't been able to build considerable inventory with some of the supply line destruction. So we're going to be able to service our customers, and we're really excited about that. So yes, you did see a big build of about 14%. (inaudible) And that's really so we can satisfy our customers' demand.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Joshua Tilton with Wolfe Research.Joshua Alexander TiltonMy first one, Aart, you might have alluded to it a little bit, but I kind of just want to ask it more clearly. Outside of all the productivity benefits that you're talking to -- from AI, do you expect these new AI tools or capabilities to make it more likely for a customer to want to choose a full flow from Synopsys versus maybe in the past where they might have put that flow together from numerous products from numerous vendors?Aart J. de GeusJoshua Alexander TiltonSuper helpful. And then just for my follow-up, it has been kind of a tough go for some of the pure-play security names this quarter so far. SIG revenue growth is obviously pretty fantastic in the quarter, but it's kind of a lagging indicator. Can you just maybe talk to how the SIG bookings have been trending? And maybe just what gives you confidence that you can continue to sustain that growth in SIG that you're seeing today throughout the rest of the year?Aart J. de GeusShelagh GlaserYes. And I would add that our long-term view of that business is 15% to 20% due to some of the headwinds that Aart mentioned. We think we're probably closer to the lower end of that, closer to the 15% this year.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Ruben Roy with Stifel.Ruben RoyAart J. de GeusOperatorOur last question will come from Gianmarco Conti with Deutsche Bank.Gianmarco Paolo ContiAart J. de GeusOperatorThis concludes our Q&A session for today. I now would like to turn the call back to Synopsys' CEO, Aart de Geus.Aart J. de GeusWell, thank you again for participating. I hope that you got the sense that we had a very strong quarter and that we're enthusiastic about the future, be it technology-wise and business-wise. And in all cases, we're always thankful for your participation in this event. Have a good rest of the day.OperatorThis concludes today's conference call. Thank you for attending. You may now disconnect.","May 18, 2023 at 6:26 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/q2-2023-synopsys-inc-earnings-112626543.html,Thomson Reuters StreetEvents,0.0,0.0,0.14921916148088024,0.40598415516774894,2023-05-18 06:26:00,2023-05-18 06:26:00,304.1000061035156,316.7799987792969,-12.67999267578125
NVDA,NVIDIA Corporation's (NASDAQ:NVDA) Stock Is Going Strong: Is the Market Following Fundamentals?,"Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. View our latest analysis for NVIDIA Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for NVIDIA is:20% = US$4.4b ÷ US$22b (Based on the trailing twelve months to January 2023).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.20 in profit.We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.To start with, NVIDIA's ROE looks acceptable. Especially when compared to the industry average of 15% the company's ROE looks pretty impressive. This probably laid the ground for NVIDIA's moderate 19% net income growth seen over the past five years.Next, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that NVIDIA's reported growth was lower than the industry growth of 30% in the same period, which is not something we like to see.In NVIDIA's case, its respectable earnings growth can probably be explained by its low three-year median payout ratio of 7.1% (or a retention ratio of 93%), which suggests that the company is investing most of its profits to grow its business.Moreover, NVIDIA is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company is expected to drop to 2.3% over the next three years. The fact that the company's ROE is expected to rise to 49% over the same period is explained by the drop in the payout ratio.","May 18, 2023 at 7:00 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-corporations-nasdaq-nvda-stock-120030971.html,Simply Wall St.,0.21666666666666665,0.41666666666666663,0.12910256410256413,0.41619658119658126,2023-05-18 07:00:00,2023-05-18 07:00:00,304.1000061035156,316.7799987792969,-12.67999267578125

NVDA,Stock markets continue rising amid retail earnings performances,"Yahoo Finance Live previews the day in the stock markets as markets continue to rise amid a slew of retail earnings performances.So speaking of the retailers here, let's call them up and see how they are doing. Indeed, well, we have got Home Depot bouncing back from yesterday, which is quite interesting here. Target, which as we said has been bouncing between gains and losses ever since its numbers came out, now it's at the highs. It's up about 1 and 1/2% right here so that's quite interesting. TJX, which as we said, also reported. Those shares are up 3.3%. So this is definitely contributing to those gains in consumer discretionary that we have been watching.But also, I want to get back to the NASDAQ 100 and take a look at some of the movers there since as we've talked about, there's really been a domination of large-cap tech thus far this year. That's happening again today. Amazon, also obviously retail, up about 1.6%. And NVIDIA, I want to call it out again because the performance here has just been incredible.We talked about it a little bit with Chris Versace earlier of Tematrica Research. Look at that, it has doubled year-to-date in part because of all of these hopes around artificial intelligence. And the company reports one week from today. As Chris said, it is priced for perfection. Meaning, it not only has to come out and beat estimates, it has to blow them away in order to see potentially further upside from these levels. We're gonna be watching that quite closely.","May 17, 2023 at 9:11 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/stock-markets-continue-rising-amid-141112223.html,Yahoo Finance Video,0.0,0.0,0.06230519480519481,0.5157142857142857,2023-05-17 09:11:00,2023-05-17 09:11:00,295.8399963378906,301.7799987792969,-5.94000244140625
NVDA,Nvidia (NVDA) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: Can the Stock Move Higher?,"The market expects Nvidia (NVDA) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended April 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on May 24, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.92 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -32.4%.Revenues are expected to be $6.51 billion, down 21.5% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.34% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Nvidia?For Nvidia, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +2.43%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Nvidia will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Nvidia would post earnings of $0.81 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.88, delivering a surprise of +8.64%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Nvidia appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) : Free Stock Analysis ReportTo read this article on Zacks.com click here.Zacks Investment Research","May 17, 2023 at 9:00 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-nvda-expected-beat-earnings-140002368.html,Zacks,0.075,0.45,0.0969332072780349,0.48083254548771787,2023-05-17 09:00:00,2023-05-17 09:00:00,295.8399963378906,301.7799987792969,-5.94000244140625
NVDA,AI speculators need to 'differentiate between actual spending and investment' and hype: Strategist,"Tematica Research CIO Chris Versace and J.P. Morgan Asset Management Global Market Strategist Meera Pandit discuss how the proliferation of AI speculation has impacted markets at large.And what bothers me a little bit about it is how companies like PepsiCo, Wendy's, and others are starting to talk about how they will be using AI and how that's going to really change their business. And then all of a sudden, I flash back to 1999, 2000 in the dot-com era when all sorts of companies were like, well, we're no longer X company. We're x.com company. And it's almost like I got to be in the game. I got to say something.The other thing I'd say is I think with a lot of these technologies, they actually require more workers up front even if eventually they will save on the labor force. So if we think about the worker's position, the shortage of workers we have, the very specific training that might be required, I think there are some headwinds when we think about the supply of workers and companies' ability to put capital in the near term.Now, I think long term, to your point, this is a huge theme that will play out over many years. But we might need to be a little bit patient. Think about, again, some of the ancillary technology required, the inputs required over a longer period of time that can fuel this theme. But I think that the huge run-up in markets solely around AI enthusiasm might be a little bit beyond its skis.CHRIS VERSACE: Thank you.","May 17, 2023 at 8:52 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/ai-speculators-differentiate-between-actual-135207681.html,Yahoo Finance Video,0.0,0.1,0.05347222222222223,0.38541666666666674,2023-05-17 08:52:00,2023-05-17 08:52:00,295.8399963378906,301.7799987792969,-5.94000244140625

NVDA,"China's BYD beefs up autonomous driving credentials with new unit, hiring spree","SHANGHAI/BEIJING, May 17 (Reuters) - BYD Co Ltd may be China's biggest electric vehicle maker by a country mile but it knows it lags rivals in autonomous driving, and has set up a new division and embarked on a huge hiring spree to rectify that shortcoming.Between 4,000 and 5,000 software engineers have been hired recently, BYD senior vice president Stella Li told an investor forum this month when quizzed why the automaker was behind in automation and intelligence technologies.""We are not ahead of others but we will come up with various types of innovation in two to three years,"" she said according to a transcript that was confirmed as accurate by the company.Current BYD recruiting advertisements for engineers specialising in autonomous driving that target top Chinese universities such as Zhejiang University, indicate that the hiring is ongoing.BYD set up an intelligent driving research division in Shanghai last year, according to three sources with direct knowledge of the matter.Previously, engineers working on autonomous driving had been scattered across various parts of the company and the new division will bring more focus to BYD's efforts in high-level automated driving technologies, they said.The sources were not authorised to speak to media and declined to be identified. The automaker, which is 9.87% owned by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc and had some 660,000 employees as of April, declined to elaborate on its autonomous driving strategy.BYD sold some 510,000 pure electric and plug-in hybrid cars in China during the first quarter, accounting for nearly 40% of sales of such vehicles and nearly four times more than Tesla Inc .Most of its cars are currently equipped with Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) developed by Bosch.By comparison, rivals like Tesla, Xpeng, Nio and Li Auto have developed their own automated driving features that are more advanced and can, for example, allow drivers to cede control of the car when on highways.BYD has also this year teamed up with autonomous driving chip technology firms Nvidia and Horizon Robotics , saying it wanted to develop more intelligent vehicles.Nvidia's Orin, one of the world's most powerful autonomous driving computing platforms, will be used in its next-generation Dynasty and Ocean series of cars, the companies said.Both are high-volume models and further advances in BYD autonomous driving features would popularise the technology within China.Horizon Robotics' Journey 5, a lower-cost alternative to Orin, will be used in BYD's Han sedans in the second half of this year, according to one of the three sources.That will help equip the model with new features that are on par with Tesla's Navigate on Autopilot, the source added.Founded just 28 years ago in southern China, BYD has outdone rivals in electric vehicles by employing a high level of vertical integration, developing and manufacturing batteries and other key components on its own.(Reporting by Zhang Yan, Sophie Yu, Zhuzhu Cui and Brenda Goh; Editing by Edwina Gibbs)","May 17, 2023 at 1:28 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chinas-byd-beefs-autonomous-driving-062852945.html,Reuters,0.2681818181818182,0.5772727272727273,0.23758591748387672,0.5393599257884971,2023-05-17 01:28:00,2023-05-17 01:28:00,295.8399963378906,301.7799987792969,-5.94000244140625

Lowering its forecast for the year.You know, another stock that we're watching today, Horizon Therapeutics, that stock taking a big hit. It sinking double digits, down 14% after the FTC sued to block Amgen's acquisition of the biotech. The government says the deal would stifle competition, arguing it would deepen Horizon's monopoly on treatments for thyroid eye disease and chronic refractory gout. Now, this marks a big stake in the ground by the FTC because, Akiko, it is the first time the government has sued to stop a pharma deal since 2009.But so much of the focus has been on the big tech deals. At least we've been focused a lot on that as well. But when you look at what happened today, Horizon Therapeutics getting hit in a big way on the back of that report, down well over 10%.We should note a federal judge still needs to approve the injunction. So this is not a done deal by any means, but now that deal potentially in danger, and Horizon Therapeutics down more than 14% today on the news.Well, chip stock AMD is trading higher today, closing up. The stock boosted after Daniel Loeb's Third Point reported a stake of 1 million shares in the chipmaker. AMD, of course, not the only chip stock on the move today.And Nvidia also trending today on Yahoo Finance on news that it now has a larger market cap than Berkshire Hathaway.

All three averages down about a quarter too-- in the case of the Dow, about a fourth of 1%. So the focus, not just today, but all week, as we've been talking about, is going to be on the consumer.And the early indications, especially if you look at Home Depot, not great.Past two days, though, still holding on to some slight gains, fractionally higher by about 4/10 of percent there. S&P 500, flat-- about as flat as it gets, holding on by a hair of its chinny chin chin to the upside here over the past two days. But here, today, it's down by about a quarter of a percent.

That's actually the lone gainer, the Lone Ranger in the green. It's up by about 1/10 of a percent. Speaking of technology, let's take a look at the NASDAQ 100 here. Some of those megacap tech stocks trying to put the team on its back in a sea of red.You've got some green among the largest of the companies here. Microsoft, fractional gains there out of the gate.

Plus, 2/10 of a percent gains for Apple and Amazon, just a little bit more than that as well.And even into some of the dollar store retailers, those are interesting to track, especially when consumers are looking for more of those discounts, are looking for some type of deal wherever they can find one. Let's zero in, just very quickly here, on Dollar General and Dollar Tree. Dollar General, you're seeing that down by about 1.2% even, right now.And then, additionally, Dollar Tree, that's down by about 1%. So largely red across the board.

NVDA,"Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights: Dexcom, Rambus, Advanced Micro Devices, Nvidia and Vipshops","Chicago, IL – May 16, 2023 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Dexcom DXCM, Rambus RMBS, Advanced Micro Devices AMD, Nvidia NVDA and Vipshops VIPS.In choppy markets, combining technical and fundamental strength becomes paramount. Below are 3 stocks that hold these characteristics and are on the verge of breaking out:DXCMDexcom's unique monitoring system is used to continuously measure a patient's blood glucose level and transmit that information to a small cell phone-sized receiver in real-time. Though the blood glucose monitoring Dexcom is highly competitive, DXCM is the leader. Last quarter, EPS grew 113% year-over-year on revenue growth of 18%.The company's EPS of $0.17 beat Zacks estimates of 15 cents by 13.3%. The positive surprise was nothing new. DXCM has a strong history of beating estimates – in 17 out of the last 19 quarters, the company has surprised to the upside.A stock that has sound fundamentals and breaks out from a long base can produce robust results. DXCM fits the criteria – the stock is emerging from a consolidation dating back to October 2022. Should the breakout hold, expect fireworks to the upside in the coming weeks.With diabetes rates increasing in the U.S. and worldwide, DXCM should benefit from solid healthcare tailwinds.RMBSRMBS has grown top and bottom-line results at a double-digit clip for several quarters in a row, and the stock's strong Zacks #2 (Buy) ranking suggests that may continue.The most intriguing part of RMBS is its strong price and volume action. RMBS has been hugging the 50-day moving average for all of 2023. The recent post-eps pullback and subsequent rebound off the 50-day moving average is a golden opportunity, in my opinion.China had one of the most stringent COVID-19 lockdown policies in the entire world. In fact, at times, Chinese President Xi was willing to allow the Chinese economy to come to a screeching halt to tamp down coronavirus cases. Throughout this time, Vipshops and most other Chinese companies suffered. However, in the past three quarters, VIPS has turned around its EPS picture and has grown EPS by 12%, 55%, and 27%. Despite the widely publicized reopening of the Chinese economy, analysts seem slow to change course. VIPS has delivered positive surprises in four straight quarters, including big beats of 42.31% and 33.33%.Finally, it appears that analysts are catching on to Vipshop's renewed growth trajectory.

NVDA,"REFILE-Asian hedge funds piled to China education, U.S. AI shares in Q1","(Corrects wording in paragraphs 4 and 11.)By Summer ZhenHONG KONG, May 16 (Reuters) - Large Asian hedge funds added Chinese education companies to their portfolios in the first quarter of 2023, and bought stocks in U.S. tech giants expected to benefit from ChatGPT and other artificial intelligence systems, regulatory filings showed.Investors poured money into private tutoring leaders, including New Oriental and TAL Education, that have come through a near two-year crackdown in China on after-school education.Hong Kong-based Greenwoods Asset Management bought 3.7 million of shares in New Oriental's U.S.-listed American depositary receipts (ADRs), making it the second largest in the fund's U.S. listed holdings. Greenwoods also built a new position in TAL Education by acquiring 2.2 million shares.TAL was also on Singapore-based FengHe’s shopping list. The fund run by ex-Alibaba CTO John Wu bought 2.1 million more shares to boost its stake in the tutoring giant. It took some profit from New Oriental during the quarter, although the latter remains its second largest exposure in the U.S. market.Share prices of both New Oriental and TAL collapsed over 90% from its peak after Beijing’s ban on K-12 private tutoring. The price of two stocks have doubled from the low point in October after China dropped its strict controls against COVID-19.In China's current market conditions, education companies stand out as spending on education does not decline as household spending declines, as parents invested in their children's future, analysts say.“The past quarter was the turning point for both New Oriental and TAL which offered very positive guidance for the next quarter and FY24,” Tina Li, an education analyst at BOCI research said in a note this week.Other big investment firms including Tairen Capital, Dantai Capital, Keystone Investors and CloudAlpha Capital were also among the active buyers of U.S.-listed Chinese education companies, according to an analysis by Reuters based on the quarterly 13F filings to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.The 13F filings reveal what investors owned in U.S. listed stocks by March 31, giving some insight into the latest investment trends.Another consensus buy during the first quarter was the big artificial intelligence (AI) players in the United States.Trivest Advisors, which has assets under management of over $3 billion, purchased roughly 800,000 shares in Nvidia Corp , to build a new position in the world's leading designer of computer chips used in creating AI. The Hong Kong-based fund also significantly added Meta Platforms Inc and Microsoft Corp. Its top three U.S. listed holdings by the end of March were all betting on AI, in order Meta, Microsoft and Nvidia.Similarly, Greenwoods scooped up Nvidia, Microsoft, and Google parent Alphabet Inc during the quarter. During an investor seminar in March, Jin Meiqiao, a portfolio manager at Greenwoods, said ChatGPT is a revolutionary product and thus the fund has made allocations to the related infrastructure field.“Apparently fund managers are looking for the future investment themes and they have higher convictions in U.S. AI areas in terms of technology advantage and scenarios of applications,” said Linus Yip, chief strategist at First Shanghai Securities.

Nvidia’s stock is up 98% so far this year, making it one of the top performers in the S&P 500 Index.“AI is very, very real and could be every bit as impactful as the internet,” Druckenmiller said at the 2023 Sohn Investment Conference last week.Duquesne Family Office added more than 208,000 shares of Nvidia during the first quarter, increasing the market value of the firm’s holding in the chipmaker to about $220 million.Tepper’s Appaloosa Management added a new position in Nvidia, buying 150,000 shares with a market value of about $41.7 million. The firm also bought 500,000 new shares of Cathie Wood’s ARK Innovation ETF, which invests in companies that create disruptive technologies. While the fund has lost three-quarters of its value since its high in early 2021, it has gained 23% this year.Duquesne Family Office added a large new position in Microsoft Corp., which now makes up 9% of the firm’s roughly $2.3 billion US equities portfolio. Microsoft has a $10 billion investment in OpenAI, whose ChatGPT tool has lit up the internet.Druckenmiller’s firm also added a new position in Iqvia Holdings Inc., a health-care technology company that says on its website it has “transformative AI capabilities” to help with its research and commercial efforts.

It’s one of the few places to gain insight into how hedge funds and some large family offices invest.Here are other highlights from 13F filings:Iconiq Capital continued to slash its stake in cloud-computing company Snowflake Inc. in the first quarter, selling 4.85 million shares. The market value of its holding totaled about $1 billion, down $625 million from the prior quarter. The San Francisco-based firm only made two new buys in the first quarter, adding small positions in game companies Roblox Corp. and Take-Two Interactive Software Inc. worth less than $1 million.The Saudi sovereign wealth fund bought almost 8.8 million shares of Electronic Arts Inc. during the first quarter, when the stock slumped following a disappointing earnings outlook. The Saudis held about 16 million shares prior to the first quarter, and held 24.8 million, with a market value of $2.99 billion, as of March 31. That makes them the largest outside stockholder in EA.George Soros’s investment firm cut holdings in electric-vehicle makers, slashing a stake in Rivian Automotive Inc. after a 90% share decline. Soros Fund Management also sold off its entire $16 million position in Tesla Inc., which it acquired during a big tech push in the second quarter of 2022. It trimmed other tech-related bets, including stakes in Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Salesforce Inc. and Intuit Inc.The investment firm that manages the Walton family’s fortune bought more shares of the nearly $38 billion Vanguard Short-Term Bond ETF.

NVDA,Sell in May and Go Away? Sure. Just Not These Stocks,"But, like most things in life, that’s only half true. Some of the best compounders of our generation were thriving during this rough period for stocks.That theme played out to a tee in this year’s cycle as November – April of 2023 saw the S&P 500 rally 9.08%. Boom!That was then. What about now?Going back to 1979, pre-election years like now hit a rough patch in the months of May – October. Of the 11 prior instances, the S&P 500 only rises a meager +1.7% in that half-year span.For giggles, I included the annual returns in the following presidential election years. Sadly, those years were ho-hum too. The average lift for stocks is just 5.81%.Looking at this table, selling in May could make sense. Afterall, investors know the average yearly return for stocks is 10% going back decades. Should we sit this period out?NO! Some of the biggest winning stocks in recent memory appeared during the treacherous months of May – October, in pre-election years.In fiscal year 2023, NVIDIA had sales of nearly $27B and earnings per share of $3.43. This monster performer started attracting heavy institutional support back in 2015. Spotting unusual buy pressure is our specialty at MAPsignals.Below plots when NVDA was profiled on our weekly Top 20 report. Those blue bars include institutional support plus healthy forward fundamentals. That many signals makes this company an outlier stock:Sitting the market out in May would mean you likely missed one of the strongest stocks of our generation.In 2022, SEDG saw revenues jump to $3.11B and EPS hit $5.95. More impressive, the company has a 5Y sales CAGR of 38.6%.With growth like that, institutions were supporting the stock. Look how SEDG was consistently climbing during the sell in May timeframe:These types of stocks remind us to keep searching for great opportunities even when the crowd is worried and bearish.Sell in May and go away is real phenomenon. Since 1979, pre-presidential election years aren’t terribly bullish for markets in the months of May – October. Election years aren’t exciting either.However, this is the type of environment when institutions are putting money to work in great stocks.NVIDIA and SolarEdge are great examples of the stock opportunities that can reveal themselves when the crowd is worried. Institutional footprints are the guiding light.Disclosure: As of the time of this writing, the author holds no positions in NVDA or SEDG at the time of this writing.

NVDA,Investors Could Be Concerned With NVIDIA's (NASDAQ:NVDA) Returns On Capital,"If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on NVIDIA is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities) See our latest analysis for NVIDIA In terms of NVIDIA's historical ROCE movements, the trend isn't fantastic. Around five years ago the returns on capital were 32%, but since then they've fallen to 16%. However it looks like NVIDIA might be reinvesting for long term growth because while capital employed has increased, the company's sales haven't changed much in the last 12 months. It's worth keeping an eye on the company's earnings from here on to see if these investments do end up contributing to the bottom line.To conclude, we've found that NVIDIA is reinvesting in the business, but returns have been falling. Yet to long term shareholders the stock has gifted them an incredible 365% return in the last five years, so the market appears to be rosy about its future. But if the trajectory of these underlying trends continue, we think the likelihood of it being a multi-bagger from here isn't high.","May 14, 2023 at 7:00 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-could-concerned-nvidias-nasdaq-120034430.html,Simply Wall St.,0.0,0.0,0.19066666666666668,0.44988888888888895,2023-05-14 07:00:00,2023-05-14 07:00:00,,,

(NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is one of the top stock picks of billionaire Ken Fisher.“Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) contributed to performance as revenues grew +27% (in USD) from the year ago quarter. Despite this strength, the Company’s customers have seen near-term weakness in demand due to Covid-19 normalization as well as the launch timing of new products. However, the Company is well-positioned to continue a long-term growth trajectory because its leading-edge capacity is being absorbed by high-performance computing applications, particularly at nontraditional integrated circuit (IC) design houses, such as Apple, Alphabet and Amazon, which have become IC-design powerhouses over the past decade. Importantly, the Company’s aggressive investment in leading-edge equipment, tight development with fabless IC designers, and embrace of open development libraries, should continue to foster a superior competitive position and attractive long-term growth.”Fisher Asset Management’s Holdings: $2,478,511,000 The Home Depot, Inc.

The company represents 1.5% of the hedge fund’s 13F portfolio.“The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) provided an update on reducing the environmental impact of its stores. Since 2010, the company has reduced U.S. store electricity use by 50% by implementing LED lighting across all of its stores, buying electricity from large-scale commercial solar farms, and installing rooftop solar farms. The company is now applying its experience to other parts of its operations, including reducing electricity use in its supply chain and water use in store irrigation. Home Depot was also recognized by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for being one of the nation’s largest green power users.”Fisher Asset Management’s Holdings: $2,579,321,000 Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

Despite the company's revenue exceeding expectations due to the upside in Gaming and Embedded segments, the analyst is concerned about AMD's weaker Q2 guidance and increasing investments in AI.Fisher's hedge fund also strengthened its position in Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) by buying 431,867 additional shares in Q1.“Last quarter we added Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) to the portfolio at 18x earnings and quickly made it into a top 5 position. At that time, Mr. Market was worried about earnings revisions for semiconductor stocks. In Q1 2023, it has been one of our best performing positions with the stock up 50%! In just three months, the market realized that Artificial Intelligence (AI) and related technologies require a lot of semiconductors. Mr. Market really is manic depressive but this volatility can give the enterprising investor just enough of a window to pick stocks with attractive risk rewards.”Fisher Asset Management’s Holdings: $2,798,969,000 Percentage of Fisher Asset Management’s Portfolio: 1.69%NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides graphics, compute, and networking solutions globally.Ken Fisher is also bullish on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) as of the end of the first quarter of 2023. His fund increased its holding in NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) by 1% in the first quarter, ending the period with over 10.08 million shares of the company.“NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a semiconductor mega-cap company and global leader in gaming cards and accelerated computing hardware and software. Shares of NVIDIA rose over 90% during the first quarter because of material developments in generative AI evidenced by the release of ChatGPT and other competitive models. On its fourth quarter fiscal 2023 earnings call on February 22, Colette Kress, NVIDIA’s CFO said, “AI adoption is at an inflection point.… The opportunity is significant and driving strong growth in data center that will accelerate through the year.” On the same call, Jensen Huang, NVIDIA’s CEO emphasized: “The accumulation of technology breakthroughs has brought AI to an inflection point. Generative AI’s versatility and capability has triggered a sense of urgency at enterprises around the world to develop and deploy AI strategies.… NVIDIA AI is essentially the operating system of AI systems today.… The activity around AI infrastructures…has just gone through the roof in the last 60 days. And so there’s no question that whatever our views [were] of this year as we enter[ed] this year has fairly dramatically changed as a result over the last 60, 90 days.” Indeed, our research indicates that shortages of NVIDIA GPUs3 are the biggest gating factor for AI adoption and that about 90% of AI-model training runs are performed on their GPUs. During its annual GTC conference4 in March, NVIDIA announced new products and services that expand its addressable market and together form a full AI computing platform. These included: (1) new AI training systems (where it is dominant) and inferencing systems (where the field is more wide open), such as specialized chips in the areas of large language models and recommender systems, simulation and graphics rendering, and video use cases; (2) new fully managed AI services in partnership with the major cloud service providers, called NVIDIA DGX Cloud and NVDIA Omniverse Cloud; (3) new domain-specific generative AI foundational models, branded NVIDIA AI Foundations, which NVIDIA customers can harness to build and train custom language models with their own proprietary data to develop differentiated offerings; and (4) industry-specific accelerator libraries, spanning such diverse verticals as genomics analysis and computational lithography. We continue to believe NVIDIA’s end-to-end AI platform and leading market share in gaming, data centers, and robotics (including automotive), along with the size of these markets, will enable the company to drive durable growth for years to come.”Fisher Asset Management’s Holdings: $2,801,441,000 Percentage of Fisher Asset Management’s Portfolio: 1.69%Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) provides global Customer Relationship Management (CRM) technology.Along with Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) is one of the top stocks on the radar of billionaire Ken Fisher.“Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) was a material contributor during the quarter. The company has taken numerous positive steps to increase profitability more quickly than expected. Salesforce also improved its corporate governance by recommending three new board members. The company is focused on improving margins, deemphasizing acquisitions, and has expanded its stock buyback plan from $10 billion to $20 billion. We believe Salesforce can pursue these opportunities while continuing to increase its competitive position.”  Suggested articles:12 Best Information Technology Services Stocks to Buy16 Most Profitable Value Stocks Now12 Best Household and Personal Care Stocks To Buy","May 14, 2023 at 6:15 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/billionaire-ken-fisher-top-10-231527952.html,Insider Monkey,0.5,0.5,0.193179788961039,0.45081980519480497,2023-05-14 18:15:00,2023-05-14 18:15:00,,,

NVDA,Nvidia Stock: Capitalizing on a Revolutionary Technology Shift,"There is a lot of hype around the potential of AI these days. Fueled by the rise of ChatGPT and the subsequent race for AI supremacy, all the Big Tech gang are looking to get a piece of the action.There’s no danger of the opportunity being overhyped, according to Rosenblatt analyst Hans Mosesmann. In fact, the 5-star analyst knows exactly which company is best positioned to benefit the most from this huge development.Mosesmann’s comments come ahead of the chip giant’s first quarter of fiscal 2024 report (April quarter), which the company will deliver on May 24. Mosesmann expects the company will meet or deliver slightly better results than those anticipated by the Street – consensus has revenue hitting $6.5 billion, and so does the company +/- 2%. The Street is calling for non-GAAP GMs (gross margins) of 66.5%, above Nvidia’s guide for ~65.3% +/- 50 bps.The analyst highlights the data center Hopper H100 ramp, “solid Gaming trends (Ada Lovelace), and stable networking” as reasons behind the optimistic forecast.Looking ahead to the July quarter, Mosesmann expects Nvidia’s top-line guide to come in at ~$7.10 billion, just ahead of the Street at $7.09 billion. That said, at the other end of the spectrum, Mosesmann is looking for non-GAAP EPS of $1.04 – a little below the $1.06 consensus estimate.Disclaimer: The opinions expressed in this article are solely those of the featured analysts.

NVDA,"The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights Meta Platforms, NVIDIA, Amazon.com, Booking Holdings and Chipotle Mexican Grill","Chicago, IL – May 12, 2023 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Meta Platforms Inc. META, NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, Booking Holdings Inc. BKNG and Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. CMG.Here are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:Wall Street has remained range-bound since April barring 2-3 days of rally or decline. Market participants are clueless about the health of the U.S. economy. Although several economic indicators have fallen substantially in 2023, the labor market stays resilient. Moreover, inflation is well above the Fed's 2% target rate despite a massive 5% hike in interest rate from March 2022 to May 2023.A large section of economists and financial experts have warned about a recession later this year. However, first-quarter 2023 earnings of corporate America are better-than-expected so far. In its May FOMC meeting, the Fed refrained from giving any clearcut signal regarding the end of the current rate hike regime.Investors remain directionless about the future trajectory of the U.S. stock movement. In such a situation, a good investment strategy can provide strong returns in the long term.First, select U.S. corporate behemoth (market capital > $50 billion) with a favorable Zacks Rank. These companies have an excellent business model, globally acclaimed brand value and a sound financial position. Second, select those corporate bigwigs that have flourished year to date with robust potential for the rest of 2023 and the long term (next 3 to 5 years).However, as developed regions mature, Meta Platforms has taken measures to drive penetration in the emerging markets of South East Asia, Latin America and Africa. Of all places, India deserves a-special mention in terms of user growth. The world's second-largest populated country offers tremendous potential for META. With China off the radar, India can prove to be a terrific growth engine for Meta.Zacks Rank #1 Meta Platform has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 8.6% and 19.6%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 12.6% over the last 30 days. Meta Platform has a long-term earnings growth potential of 19.5%. The stock price of META has jumped 93.7% year to date.A collaboration with Mercedes-Benz and Audi is likely to enhance NVDA's presence in autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space. We expect its Automotive segment's revenues to witness a CAGR of 29% through fiscal 2023-2025.Zacks Rank #2 NVIDIA has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 10% and 34.7%, respectively, for the current year (ending January 2024). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.2% over the last 30 days. NVIDIA has a long-term earnings growth potential of 17.5%. The stock price of NVDA has soared 97.6% year to date.Robust Alexa skills and an expanding smart home products portfolio are positives. AMZN's strong global presence and solid momentum across small and medium businesses remain tailwinds. Considering the abovementioned facts, we expect 2023 revenues to be up 5% from 2022.Zacks Rank #2 Amazon has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 8.9% and more than 100%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 2% over the last 30 days. Amazon has a long-term earnings growth potential of 18.4%. The stock price of AMZN has advanced 31.2% year to date.Also, solid momentum across the agency, merchant, and advertising and other businesses is a tailwind for BKNG. Our estimates suggest that agency, merchant, and advertising and other revenues would see a year-over-year rise of 2.3%, 18.7% and 8.2%, respectively, in 2023. Further, strengthening alternative accommodation business and flight capabilities are major positives. We expect 2023 total revenues to be up 9.5% from 2022.Zacks Rank #1 Booking Holdings has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 19.9% and 36.5%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 4% over the last seven days. Booking Holdings has a long-term earnings growth potential of 16.5%. The stock price of BKNG has surged 31.3% year to date.CMG reported solid benefits from Project Square One with improvements, including throughput on the frontline, on-time and accuracy on the digital make line. CMG also emphasizes smarter pickup times to boost growth.Zacks Rank #1 Chipotle Mexican Grill has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 13.3% and 32.6%, respectively, for the current year.

NVDA,How to Find Strong Computer and Technology Stocks Slated for Positive Earnings Surprises,"Wall Street watches a company's quarterly report closely to understand as much as possible about its recent performance and what to expect going forward. Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.NVDA has an Earnings ESP figure of 2.43%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $0.94 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.92.Wesco International, which is readying to report earnings on August 3, 2023, sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now. It's Most Accurate Estimate is currently $4.50 a share, and WCC is 84 days out from its next earnings report.For Wesco International, the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.50 is 0.17%.Because both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, NVDA and WCC could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

NVDA,Is It Worth Investing in Nvidia (NVDA) Based on Wall Street's Bullish Views?,"The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?Nvidia currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.48, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 32 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.48 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 32 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 22 are Strong Buy and four are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 68.8% and 12.5% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for NVDADo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.ABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.Is NVDA a Good Investment?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for Nvidia, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.5% over the past month to $4.52.Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Nvidia.

NVDA,"The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights Meta Platforms, Fortinet, Manhattan Associates, NVIDIA and CrowdStrike Holdings","Chicago, IL – May 11, 2023 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Meta Platforms Inc. META, Fortinet Inc. FTNT, Manhattan Associates Inc. MANH, NVIDIA Corp. NVDA and CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. CRWD.Here are highlights from Wednesday’s Analyst Blog:Wall Street was range-bound in the past month as market participants remained indecisive regarding U.S. economic growth and interest rate trajectory. In its recently concluded May FOMC meeting, the Fed raised the benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to the range of 5-5.25%, marking the highest Fed Fund rate since August 2007.In first-quarter 2023, U.S. GDP growth rate came in at a moderate 1.1% compared with the consensus estimate of 2% and the fourth-quarter 2022 growth rate of 2.6%. Moreover, the Conference Board's Leading Economic Index, a gauge of future economic activity, dropped to 108.4 in March from February's revised reading of 109.7, its 12th successive monthly drop and the lowest reading since November 2020.Precipitous contraction in ISM manufacturing and services activities, a decline in orders of durable goods, a reduction in construction activities, and a freight recession are all signaling a recession later this year. Fed Chair also acknowledged that the current banking turmoil in the United States has led to tighter credit conditions, and may impact economic activities.Despite the above-mentioned headwinds, the tech-heavy has maintained its northbound journey since the beginning of 2023. Year to date, the Nasdaq Composite has rallied 16.4%. The Dow and the S&P 500 have gained 1.3% and 7.3%, respectively, in the same period.Nasdaq Composite's performance is primarily linked to the movement of interest rate. The performance of growth stocks like technology is inversely related to the interest rate trajectory. The Nasdaq Composite was the best performer in the pandemic-ridden 2020 and 2021 as the Fed kept the benchmark interest rate to almost zero.Just the opposite happened in 2022 as the central bank hiked the lending rate by a massive 4.5% to combat record-high inflation. The valuation of most of the technology behemoths plunged last year.The situation once again turned in favor of the Nasdaq Composite as Fed Chairman Jerome Powell indicated that the ongoing rate hike cycle is perhaps reaching its end, although it will depend on the outcome of economic data.However, as developed regions mature, Meta Platforms has taken measures to drive penetration in emerging markets of South East Asia, Latin America and Africa.

NVDA,5 High-Flying Bigwigs to Buy for Long -Term Gains,"Wall Street has remained rangebound since April barring 2-3 days of rally or decline. Market participants are clueless about the health of the U.S. economy. Although several economic indicators have fallen substantially in 2023, the labor market stays resilient. Moreover, inflation is well above the Fed’s 2% target rate despite a massive 5% hike in interest rate from March 2022 to May 2023.A large section of economists and financial experts have warned about a recession later this year. However, first-quarter 2023 earnings of corporate America are better-than-expected so far.

META,Why Montana's TikTok ban faces massive challenges,"Montana on Wednesday became the first state in the country to ban TikTok. But experts say you shouldn’t expect the measure to survive challenges in the courts.“The ban is a dramatic and unconstitutional incursion on the First Amendment rights of Montanans,” Ramya Krishnan, staff attorney at the Knight First Amendment Institute and a lecturer in law at Columbia Law School, told Yahoo Finance. “To justify the ban, Montana would have to show that it's necessary to prevent actual harms. And it hasn't done this.”In a statement after signing the bill, Gov. Greg Gianforte said the Chinese Communist Party is using TikTok to “spy on Americans, violate their privacy, and collect personal, private, and sensitive information.”The broader problem for Montana’s law, experts say, is that it’s simply too broad.“The legal hurdle is the First Amendment,” David Greene, civil liberties director and senior staff attorney for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, explained via email. “This law, as a restriction on the way Montanans speak and receive speech, will need to be justified by the state as an appropriately narrow and effective way of protecting Montanans’ personal data. That will be very difficult to do.”The US has long accused TikTok of collecting data on Americans and feeding it to the Chinese government. Reasons include, potentially, building a database on American users, storing data to blackmail citizens, or trying to spread disinformation online.The main fear is that China can use its national intelligence law to force TikTok parent company ByteDance to turn over any data on American users to the Chinese government. TikTok, however, has said it has never shared information with the Chinese government.Neither the US government nor Montana has provided concrete evidence that China is siphoning American user data from TikTok. And that’s a major problem for the new law. “Speculative harms can't justify a total ban on a communications platform, let alone one that is used by...Americans in the state of Montana,” said Krishnan.Even enforcing the ban could prove problematic for Montana. If the state chooses to determine residents’ locations based on their internet protocol addresses, they could accidentally block citizens of bordering states from downloading TikTok, as well. Montanans could also use virtual private networks to mask their location and download the app anyway.Rather than outright banning TikTok, experts say the best way to address concerns that the company is harvesting Americans’ data is through a national data privacy law. Congress has discussed the topic for years without passing any legislation.“First look at passing a federal privacy law…to ensure that there are specific limits and rules for the road of how any online service, TikTok included, can collect and use and share people's personal information,” Emma Llansó, director of the Center for Democracy and Technology's Free Expression Project told Yahoo Finance.“That would be an enormous step forward for people's privacy, and would not require banning any apps whatsoever.”According to Llansó, the government could also put restrictions on how data brokers in the US share Americans’ information.“They could put limits on that or put a stop to that, and that would be a much more meaningful way to protect the safety and security of people's data from foreign government surveillance,” she explained.Regardless, we won’t have to wait long to find out how Montana’s ban will fare in the courts. According to Reuters, a group of five Montana TikTok users are already suing the state to block the ban.The clock is ticking.Find live stock market quotes and the latest business and finance news","May 19, 2023 at 1:28 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-montanas-tiktok-ban-faces-massive-challenges-182836790.html,Yahoo Finance,0.0,1.0,0.0990447957839262,0.40813452851496335,2023-05-19 13:28:00,2023-05-19 13:28:00,247.47000122070312,245.63999938964844,1.8300018310546875

META,"Twitter, TikTok, Meta: Gary Vaynerchuk's takes on social media advertising","VaynerX Chairman Gary Vaynerchuk joins Yahoo Finance Live from VeeCon 2023 to discuss his three-day conference, Twitter's new CEO, Montana's TikTok ban, social media advertising, and consumer trends.Here to discuss the conference, consumer behaviors, and innovations like AI is the creator and host of VeeCon, Gary Vaynerchuk, chairman of VaynerX. All right, Gary ""Vee,"" as we all know you-- I follow you on Twitter. Everybody follows you on Twitter. First, let's just talk about the conference. I see you have some heavy hitters in the lineup. You started yesterday. What's been the vibe like, if you will?So, yes, it was phenomenal. The weather was great in Indy, thank God. Thousands and thousands and thousands of people on a field day, doing different events. And the lineup, it was just outrageous of the 130 speakers that we have at the conference over the next few days here in the stadium at Lucas Oil. So, so far, so good.But obviously, Linda comes in with as much equity in adland as there can be. And she's been a remarkable innovator and executive in the traditional media space. And now what she's done for championing brands spending money on TV commercials, she'll be doing for that for Twitter. And she was highly effective in her old role. And to WPP's stance, I fully agree. There's not going to be a single brand that's going to be concerned to spend on that platform. So from that standpoint, I think it's a win. And that's how I see it.What I know is that I am not overly emotional about any platform. When Vine is hot, I'm marketing there. When Facebook's hot, I'm marketing there. It's kind of like running commercials on ""Seinfeld."" When it's the number one TV show, you run ads. When it's not there anymore, you run it somewhere else. So attention will ebb and flow, but to answer you directly, it's just, we're talking about banning something because they're spying on us. That's a much bigger thing than marketing.People are not paying attention to what's happening on Facebook Reels right now. A lot of marketers, especially the youngsters that are watching this, don't even have a Facebook.

META,Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) Will Be Hoping To Turn Its Returns On Capital Around,"For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for Meta Platforms, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities) See our latest analysis for Meta Platforms On the surface, the trend of ROCE at Meta Platforms doesn't inspire confidence. To be more specific, while the ROCE is still high, it's fallen from 27% where it was five years ago. However it looks like Meta Platforms might be reinvesting for long term growth because while capital employed has increased, the company's sales haven't changed much in the last 12 months. It's worth keeping an eye on the company's earnings from here on to see if these investments do end up contributing to the bottom line.To conclude, we've found that Meta Platforms is reinvesting in the business, but returns have been falling. Unsurprisingly, the stock has only gained 33% over the last five years, which potentially indicates that investors are accounting for this going forward. So if you're looking for a multi-bagger, the underlying trends indicate you may have better chances elsewhere.","May 19, 2023 at 8:00 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meta-platforms-nasdaq-meta-hoping-130011553.html,Simply Wall St.,0.0,0.0,0.174,0.49581481481481476,2023-05-19 08:00:00,2023-05-19 08:00:00,247.47000122070312,245.63999938964844,1.8300018310546875

In deciding they could not, the court left a 27-year old law intact.Although the attack that prompted the suit was terrible and tragic, Diakun said, imposing liability on the platforms in these circumstances would have had far-reaching implications for free speech online.

META,"Metas Pricey Bet on AI Comes With New Custom Chips, Coder Tools","(Bloomberg) -- In Meta Platforms Inc.’s year of cost cutting and layoffs, there’s one area that’s seeing record spending: an update of the social media giant’s infrastructure to keep pace in the artificial intelligence arms race.Most Read from BloombergMcCarthy Puts Debt-Limit Talks on ‘Pause’ as Clock Ticks DownDisney Closes Florida Star Wars Hotel, Scraps Plan to Move 2,000 EmployeesMorgan Stanley CEO Gorman to Step Down Within 12 MonthsWall Street Fears $1 Trillion Aftershock From Debt DealNYC Skyscrapers Sit Vacant, Exposing Risk City Never PredictedOn Thursday, the Facebook owner unveiled a slew of new technologies, including a new chip developed in-house to help train AI faster, and a tool that helps coders get suggestions for how to build their products. The company is also revamping its data centers to make it easier to deploy AI technology.“This work reflects long term efforts that will enable even more advances and better use of this technology across everything we do,” Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg said in an emailed statement.The custom accelerator chip will help speed up the recommendation algorithm that powers what people see on Facebook and Instagram. A new data center design is being rolled out specifically for hardware that’s best for AI. Meta said it has also finished the second phase of building its AI supercomputer to train large language models, which are technologies similar to those that power ChatGPT.Meta’s capital expenditures hit a record $31.4 billion last year, more than four-and-a-half times the amount in 2017. This year, which Zuckerberg has called Meta’s “year of efficiency,” analysts expect a repeat of 2022’s levels, with many of those dollars going toward improving and expanding AI infrastructure.“There is a little bit of tension” with the efficiency mandate, “but it’s not in direct competition to be investing in AI and also investing in efficiency,” said Kim Hazelwood, director of AI research at Meta.Some of the AI updates are obvious drivers of efficiency within Meta, which has eliminated thousands of employees in recent months.CodeCompose is a new generative AI-based tool for developers that can auto-complete or suggest changes to code. So far, 5,200 coders are using it in-house, accepting 22% of the suggestions it makes for code completion, the company said.The company has been increasingly looking to AI to solve its biggest business problems. For advertisers that have been frustrated by privacy changes from Apple Inc. that made their digital ads harder to target, Meta plans to use AI to make some better guesses about user interests. To compete with TikTok, Facebook and Instagram are starting to show content from people users don’t follow — something that requires an algorithm to guess what they may be interested in.Investors are going to be looking for direct proof of those improvements to justify the deep spending, Angelo Zino, an analyst at CFRA Research, said in an interview.“It’s clearly going to take some time for some of this stuff to really play itself out,” Zino said of Meta’s increase in capex spending generally. “There’s going to be a lot of scrutiny, making sure that they can start seeing an acceleration in some of those returns on the revenue side.”When AI models are queried, they spit out answers, called inferences, that require a specific type of processing. Meta decided to develop new chips, called Meta Training and Inference Accelerator (MTIA), to help do the specific work in-house, complementing its slew of graphics processing units from Nvidia.Meta hopes its MTIA chips will help the company spin up more accurate and interesting predictions of what types of original and ad content users see, hopefully leading to people spending more time on the apps and clicking on more advertisements.The company also launched its first in-house built, application-specific integrated circuit – or ASIC – designed for processing videos and live streaming. Already, users on Facebook and Instagram share more than 2 billion short videos a day, and this new processor can help these videos show up faster using less data on any device a person may be watching.“We’ve been able to optimize and balance and target our first chips for our recommender models,” said Alexis Bjorlin, vice president of hardware engineering. “We also have all the visibility on what the different needs are for generative-AI workloads or any different element that comes down the pipe.”While the recommendation engines used on Meta’s social media apps are its current version of AI technology, key to future generative-AI work is the company’s AI supercomputer, called the Research SuperCluster, which the company will use to train large sets of artificial intelligence programs, called models.On Thursday, the company said it had completed its second phase of its build-out, which trains its large language model called LLaMA and will be a key part of its efforts to build the metaverse — a virtual reality platform for which the company was renamed from Facebook.Meta has long been committed to making some of its sophisticated tech available to the outside community. While much of this hardware in its stack isn’t, some of the work that it powers will be open source. LLaMA is shared with researchers, as is an AI model trained on its supercomputer that can solve ten International Math Olympiad problems. CodeCompose was built on public revelations shared by Meta’s AI research team. And its new inference chip will help the company continue to support PyTorch, the open source AI framework that Meta created and then shifted to the Linux Foundation to give it more independence.Although Meta has been working on AI tools for years, Zuckerberg chose to frame his company’s future around a virtual reality vision that was even more nebulous. That pivot has faced sharp investor scrutiny, so the deep investment in AI infrastructure could help rebuild confidence in Zuckerberg’s overall strategy, said Scott Kessler, analyst at investment researcher Third Bridge.“They don’t want to be an also-ran” when it comes to the industry-wide race to infuse AI into businesses, Kessler said. “A lot more people are going to kind of buy into that narrative now than say, six and nine months ago.”Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekApple’s New Headset Meets RealityJapan’s New Military Might Is Rising in a Factory in HiroshimaESG Investing Goes Quiet After Blistering Republican AttacksThe True Cost of an Extended US Debt-Ceiling StandoffSweetgreen Tests Robots to Make Faster, More Efficient Sad Desk Salads©2023 Bloomberg L.P.","May 18, 2023 at 11:00 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meta-pricey-bet-ai-comes-160000864.html,Bloomberg,0.13636363636363635,0.45454545454545453,0.12324086731981468,0.4228241057188424,2023-05-18 11:00:00,2023-05-18 11:00:00,241.3000030517578,246.8500061035156,-5.550003051757784

META,Meta Platforms Sells Kustomer For $250M In A Rare Divestiture Deal With Venture Firms Taking Over,"The move comes as Meta looks to focus on its core business and marks a rare instance where Meta is trading its ownership of Kustomer for a passive minority stake in the company. Under the deal, the three venture firms will jointly invest $60 million of capital in Kustomer to cover its operating costs, and Meta will remain the largest stakeholder but won't have a seat on its board. The deal values Kustomer at $250 million.Kustomer's software enables businesses to communicate with consumers via a variety of channels, including phone, email, text messages, WhatsApp and Instagram, taking conversations from different channels and putting them on a single screen. After the deal closed, Kustomer employees were told they would be a linchpin in Meta’s e-commerce strategy, but Meta whittled down Kustomer’s ranks over multiple rounds of layoffs.There is a silver lining for those in the gaming industry. Teams focused on gaming will be able to hire for certain roles once the layoffs conclude, according to sources familiar with the matter. This comes as enthusiasm for gaming within Meta continues to grow, with some hardware elements being ""retooled"" to improve Quest headsets for gaming and game developers.Zuckerberg reportedly defended his top managers' performance but also announced that the company will slow hiring and onboarding of new employees in the wake of the layoffs, which affected 4,000 workers across Meta's tech divisions.The sale of Kustomer represents a significant downgrade from how Meta previously viewed the unit, as the terms of the deal suggest. The decision to maintain a stake in a Kustomer spinout rather than outright sell the company to other suitors was made by Meta as the company had endured more than a year of antitrust scrutiny from both U.S. and European regulators before the deal closed last year. Collaborative Robots Startup Using Teams Of AI-Powered Drones To Make Flying SaferAI Startups Turn to Retail Investors To Fund the Growth of the $1.59 Trillion Artificial Intelligence Market  .© 2023 Benzinga.com.

META,Meta to face record EU privacy fine over Facebook data transfer to US,"By Foo Yun Chee and Padraic Halpin(Reuters) - Meta Platforms Inc is set to face a record European Union privacy fine related to data transfer of Facebook's EU users to U.S. servers for failing to comply with a warning by a top EU court, two sources familiar with the matter said.The penalty will be higher than the previous record 746 million euros ($821.20 million) fine for Amazon.com Inc, according to the sources.Meta declined to comment, while the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC) and the European Commission did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment.EU regulators led by Ireland's Data Protection Commissioner Helen Dixon have been finalising a ban on the legal tool used by Facebook to transfer European user data because of concerns U.S. intelligence agencies could access the information.In April, they said the Irish DPC had one month to make an order blocking Facebook's transatlantic data flows. The ban could be in place by mid-May.Europe's highest court ruled in 2020 that an EU-U.S. data transfer agreement was invalid, citing surveillance concerns.Meta last year warned that an order to ban the mechanism it uses to transfer data from Europe to the United States could force it to suspend Facebook services in Europe.($1 = 0.9084 euros)(Additional reporting by Chavi Mehta in Bengaluru; Editing by Shailesh Kuber and Shounak Dasgupta)","May 17, 2023 at 12:05 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meta-face-record-eu-privacy-170517492.html,Reuters,0.4166666666666667,0.5,0.14226190476190476,0.2380952380952381,2023-05-17 12:05:00,2023-05-17 12:05:00,238.4499969482422,242.4900054931641,-4.040008544921903
META,The A.I. revolution could be under threat as Big Tech attempts to take web data out of the public domain,"Technologies that fundamentally change society only come around once every decade or so. The Internet was one. Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) is the next. A.I. has the potential to improve lives and reshape industries from healthcare to finance–but A.I. can only be as good as the quality of data it’s trained on.If Big Tech is allowed to build a walled garden around data that’s present in the public domain (meaning data that isn’t behind a login), it will prevent A.I. from reaching its full potential.Looking ahead, the volume of data and information created, captured, copied, and consumed worldwide is expected to reach 120 zettabytes this year–nearly triple what it was in just 2019.If publicly available web data is stripped from the public and held onto only by the most powerful companies, the ability for A.I. to advance in a way that benefits society would be severely limited. If only a few companies were developing cutting-edge A.I., its development will not be aligned with humanity’s best interests.The potential for A.I. to be used for social good is equally exciting. For example, through our pro bono program, The Bright Initiative, we assist nonprofit, academic and charitable organizations, helping them tackle serious social problems such as antisemitism, hate speech, and human trafficking.More broadly, developers must have access to the datasets they need to ethically train A.I. By providing a vast amount of diverse and up-to-date information, public web data can be used to train machine learning models, improve accuracy, and ensure A.I. is aligned with humanity’s goals.","May 17, 2023 at 9:36 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/revolution-could-under-threat-big-143648351.html,Fortune,0.0,0.08333333333333334,0.0912001287001287,0.5190637065637066,2023-05-17 09:36:00,2023-05-17 09:36:00,238.4499969482422,242.4900054931641,-4.040008544921903

META,11 Best Internet Content Stocks to Buy,"That’s why companies have started to spend a fortune on improving their audio content and audio delivery channels. YouTube, which is the world’s biggest video platform, is also joining the audio race. YouTube Music and Premium service has already surpassed 80 million paid subscribers. Earlier this year, the company confirmed to Tech Crunch that it will bring audio and video-first podcasts to YouTube Music for users in the U.S. The company was reportedly working on features that will allow users to switch to audio mode while watching video podcasts.The internet content industry is also embracing AI and is already seeing its benefits.“We see opportunities for continued gains in the near and medium-term, with our AI investments powering a lot of this work as we continue to improve ads ranking and enable increased automation for advertisers to make it easier for them to run campaigns and use our systems to optimize their performance. Another opportunity we have is to further scale onsite conversions through products like click-to-message, lead ads and shop ads.Click-to-message ads continue to grow quickly and we believe they are bringing incremental demand onto our platform, with over half of click-to-message advertisers exclusively using click-to-messaging ads on our platform. We see further opportunity as we continue to scale click-to-WhatsApp ads and are investing in growing newer formats like shop ads. Over the long-term, we are investing heavily in AI to develop and deploy privacy-enhancing technologies and continue building new tools that will make it easier for advertisers to create and deliver more relevant and engaging ads. Moving now to our efficiency work, we took significant actions in 2022 to operate more efficiently. In Q4, we made the difficult decision to layoff employees while deprioritizing certain projects and curtailing non-headcount-related expenses.”Apparently Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)’s strategy and new product initiatives worked as the company reported upbeat revenue for the first quarter of 2023.  The company’s short-form video content feature “Reels” was one of the factors that contributed to the growth. Mark Zuckerberg said in the company’s latest earnings call:“When we started this work last year, our business wasn’t performing as well as I wanted. But now we’re increasingly doing this work from a position of strength.”The success of Reels wasn’t surprising though. In a bid to compete with TikTok, which has posted record levels of growth in North America and Asia, companies like Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) poured their resources to roll out short-form video features. And those efforts are paying off.

META,Meta Touts Metaverses Potential for Job Training and Education,"(Bloomberg) -- Meta Platforms Inc. is hoping to revive interest in the metaverse by pitching it as a tool to help train workforces, showing the social media giant isn’t backing down on its virtual reality ambitions even as artificial intelligence takes center stage.Most Read from BloombergMcCarthy Puts Debt-Limit Talks on ‘Pause’ as Clock Ticks DownDisney Closes Florida Star Wars Hotel, Scraps Plan to Move 2,000 EmployeesMorgan Stanley CEO Gorman to Step Down Within 12 MonthsWall Street Fears $1 Trillion Aftershock From Debt DealNYC Skyscrapers Sit Vacant, Exposing Risk City Never PredictedNick Clegg, president of global affairs, touted the “transformative” role augmented and virtual reality can play in job training and education, speaking at the company’s “Future of Work Summit” in Washington on Tuesday. The event was hosted by companies like Interplay Learning, Talespin and Embodied Labs.“I certainly believe when it comes to AR and VR, it’s very obvious to me that one of the most powerful applications is the ability to dramatically improve re-skilling,” Clegg said pointing to applications in skilled trades as well as schools and elder care.Clegg sounded optimistic despite fading enthusiasm around the metaverse and recent job cuts at Reality Labs — the Meta division that produces the Quest VR headset and the Horizon Worlds VR platform. Clegg said it would be “about 10 to 15 years before the technology is sufficiently mature and affordable and accessible to really have the same kind of prevalence in society.”Doug Donavon, chief executive officer of Interplay Learning, which uses Meta’s VR headsets to train workers in trades like plumbing, HVAC systems and electrical services, said the technology has helped create a “boot camp style” training that gets people prepared for jobs in five to six weeks versus several months. While there’s more commitment by employers in these industries to use VR, adopting the technology remains a hurdle. “There’s not full buy-in,” Donovan said at the event. “It’s a hand-to-hand battle to convince them there’s potential.”Recent advancements in artificial intelligence and specifically the generative AI behind the popular chatbot ChatGPT, have captivated the tech world, sprouting new startups. Clegg said the changing hype cycle is helping the company’s metaverse goals, not replacing them. “We can do both. It’s not a tradeoff,” he said.“One entirely reinforces the other. It’s impossible to imagine people enjoying the metaverse in the future without generative AI,” Clegg added, giving an example about shortening the time to build a virtual world by using a simple verbal prompt.The rise of artificial intelligence has also renewed fears about people’s jobs being replaced. For Meta, those concerns present an opportunity to position the technology as a way to put more people in jobs, not displace them, Clegg said.That selling point has already garnered some support on Capitol Hill. Last week, US House Representatives Lisa Blunt Rochester, a democrat from Delaware, and Tim Walberg, a republican from Michigan introduced the Immersive Technology for the American Workforce Act, a bipartisan bill that creates a five-year grant program at the Department of Labor to support community colleges and career education centers in deploying augmented and virtual reality in classrooms.Beyond the loss of jobs, AI is also prompting ethical, legal and national security concerns about what the technology can do. Even Sam Altman, the creator of ChatGPT, called on US Senators on Tuesday to more heavily regulate AI technologies, warning that it’s powerful enough to change society in unpredictable ways.Clegg said Meta has had “numerous conversations” about what regulating the metaverse would look like and welcomes guardrails. “I think one thing we’ve all learned over the last decade and a half is that it’s not great when you have technology erupt and then you have retrospective legislation,” Clegg said, adding that AI is a more pressing challenge with regulators at the moment. “The good thing about the AR/VR technology is that we have time. We don’t need to do this in a mad rush,” he said.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekApple’s New Headset Meets RealityJapan’s New Military Might Is Rising in a Factory in HiroshimaESG Investing Goes Quiet After Blistering Republican AttacksThe True Cost of an Extended US Debt-Ceiling StandoffSweetgreen Tests Robots to Make Faster, More Efficient Sad Desk Salads©2023 Bloomberg L.P.","May 16, 2023 at 3:16 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meta-touts-metaverse-potential-job-201621848.html,Bloomberg,0.0,1.0,0.047426647426647414,0.49033309283309284,2023-05-16 15:16:00,2023-05-16 15:16:00,235.7899932861328,238.82000732421875,-3.0300140380859375
META,Facebook and Instagram Aren't Refunding Small Businesses Fast Enough After Ad Glitch,"(Bloomberg) -- Meta Platforms Inc. has started refunding advertisers’ money for a major glitch last month that caused businesses to significantly overspend for their promotions on Facebook and Instagram. But some smaller clients are still waiting to hear whether the social media company will make good on their losses.Most Read from BloombergMcCarthy Puts Debt-Limit Talks on ‘Pause’ as Clock Ticks DownDisney Closes Florida Star Wars Hotel, Scraps Plan to Move 2,000 EmployeesMorgan Stanley CEO Gorman to Step Down Within 12 MonthsWall Street Fears $1 Trillion Aftershock From Debt DealNYC Skyscrapers Sit Vacant, Exposing Risk City Never PredictedLarge accounts — those that may spend more than $200,000 per month — often have a direct customer service line at Meta or even a designated account representative to call in the event of an error. The smaller customers, which make up the vast majority of the spending on Meta’s ads, don’t have the same access. Instead, they have been forced to try and recoup thousands of mistakenly spent dollars through chatbots, or to learn about the status of potential refunds second-hand, according to multiple ad agencies that represent hundreds of clients in total.On the morning of April 23, an error on Meta’s automated ad platform caused some advertisers to spontaneously spend more than intended on Facebook, or to use their budgets in inefficient ways. In the weeks since the glitch, advertisers and their agencies have reached out to Meta for refunds, but the company has responded slowly, if at all. “It’s just radio silence,” said Tyler Garner, head of media buying at digital marketing agency GrowRev.Some advertisers did receive refunds from Meta beginning on May 12, although the amounts have been doled out inconsistently and it's not clear why some businesses received more money back than others. In the past, advertisers that spent a lot on Facebook or had personal connections at the company had better luck getting refunded, according to several agency representatives.“We identified and resolved a technical issue in our automated systems that caused ad delivery issues like faster campaign spending and more variable costs,” Meta said in a statement. “We fixed this as quickly as possible and apologize for any inconvenience it may have caused.”Meta has more than 10 million active advertisers trying to reach users on Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger. During the pandemic, as reduced store traffic meant small businesses became even more reliant on social media to reach customers, Meta also reduced its use of human contractors whose job it was to answer filed complaints. The company hasn’t fully rebuilt that capacity and is instead depending on artificial intelligence chatbots to provide users answers wherever possible. Later this month, the company plans to lay off more full-time employees in its business departments.The results of cuts to customer service have shaken confidence in the company. Small advertisers rely on Facebook ads to perform consistently and efficiently. If a small advertiser spends $5,000 on ads, they might earn back $10,000 in sales, said Barry Hott, an independent advertising consultant who has worked with brands like Microsoft, Harry’s and AT&T. But if one day the advertiser only makes back $5,000, then “basically, you just got robbed by Facebook,” he said. And a smaller brand will have “almost no voice,” he added.It’s a tumultuous time for Meta’s advertising business. In the past year, the tech giant’s ad sales have been squeezed by an uncertain economy and a change in Apple’s iOS privacy policies that made promotions less effective. The pressure on revenue led to three straight quarters of sales declines, as well as two major rounds of layoffs and a company-wide “efficiency” mandate.Competition for advertisers’ dollars is meanwhile fiercer than ever. Amazon.com Inc., streaming video services like Hulu and social platforms like TikTok are all fighting for their slice of the budgets alongside Meta and Alphabet Inc.’s Google — particularly with small businesses.Meta’s ad glitch caused large proportions of advertisers’ campaign dollars to be spent all at once with an abnormally fast rate, making their marketing less effective, according to advertising agency executives. One business said it had its worst return on Sunday advertising spending on record, ultimately posting 85% lower sales than the previous Sunday and 76% lower than two weeks prior, one of the people said.One e-commerce advertiser, who said his entire daily budget of $13,000 was spent in three hours during the glitch with no results, said chat support offered advice on modifying his budget for next time, instead of a path toward a refund. He asked to remain anonymous for fear of retribution from Meta.“The impact more than anything is the damage it can have in clients’ cash flow,” Garner said. That is crucial for paying for future ads and staff wages while meeting monthly sales targets, he said. He considers Google ads safer for small budgets, as that platform tends to provide refunds within 2 to 3 days of an error. “They’re proactive on the matter,” he said.Meta’s refund process is known to be a black box, said Arturo Villalobos, whose advertising agency Salvo Media represents clients that spend anywhere from $20,000 to $1.5 million per month across Facebook and Instagram. Refunds for ad glitches are typically cents on the dollar, and Meta doesn’t tell advertisers how it calculates the payout. “There’s no way for us to know, was that the full refund? Or are you giving me a small portion of what was actually inefficiently spent?” Villalobos said. “The sad thing is, we’re just looking at a screen that has a bunch of numbers and we're kind of relying on Facebook to feed us accurate information.”Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekApple’s New Headset Meets RealityJapan’s New Military Might Is Rising in a Factory in HiroshimaESG Investing Goes Quiet After Blistering Republican AttacksThe True Cost of an Extended US Debt-Ceiling StandoffSweetgreen Tests Robots to Make Faster, More Efficient Sad Desk Salads©2023 Bloomberg L.P.","May 16, 2023 at 2:44 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meta-advertising-glitch-refunds-slow-194431076.html,Bloomberg,-0.016666666666666663,0.5,0.051951155176961646,0.41972994150413506,2023-05-16 14:44:00,2023-05-16 14:44:00,235.7899932861328,238.82000732421875,-3.0300140380859375

META,4 big analyst picks: Meta stock a buy on sprightly revenue prospects,"Here is your Pro Recap of the biggest analyst picks you may have missed since yesterday: upgrades for Meta, Charles Schwab, Albemarle, and Gilead Sciences.Shares gained more than 2% yesterday.Charles Schwab (NYSE:SCHW) shares rose more than 4% yesterday after Raymond James upgraded the company to Outperform from Market Perform, establishing a $63 target price.According to the firm, recent data suggests that client cash sorting at Schwab is tapering, which should stabilize the balance sheet and net interest margin in the second half of 2023.Although stricter regulations may pose a challenge, the firm believes the impact on Schwab's earnings power will be relatively limited. While elevated cash sorting highlights the interest rate risk in their business model, Schwab has low credit risk and a strong growth story, unaffected by recent macro events. Raymond James anticipates potential P/E multiple re-rating once EPS estimates stabilize.Shares gained more than 4% yesterday.Among the reasons for the upgrade, the firm also mentioned an improving solid tumor oncology business, anchored by Trodelvy, and durable growth anchored by the HIV/Virology business.Related Articles4 big analyst picks: Meta stock a buy on sprightly revenue prospectsCummins's Atmus Filtration Technologies Launches 14.12M Share IPO at $18-$21/shCanada's industry minister 'confident' in deal to build Stellantis battery plant","May 16, 2023 at 1:25 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-big-analyst-picks-meta-062543379.html,Investing.com,0.2,0.39999999999999997,0.11569264069264071,0.37846320346320345,2023-05-16 01:25:00,2023-05-16 01:25:00,235.7899932861328,238.82000732421875,-3.0300140380859375

META,Mark Zuckerberg Reveals Social Media Feeds Are Now Fueled By AI-Generated Content,"If you’ve noticed a shift in your social media feeds recently, where you’re seeing content from creators you don’t follow or pages you’ve never “liked,” then you’re not alone. This change to your newsfeed is here to stay.AI-powered recommendations have already made an impact, leading to a more than 24% increase in time spent on Instagram since launching the TikTok-rival short-video Reels in September 2021. This shift represents a long-standing commitment to using AI to transform the way people consume social media content, with Meta working on the technology for years.This shift is no surprise to those who have been following Zuckerberg’s predictions. In 2022, he stated that 15% of feed content was AI generated and that the company expected these numbers to more than double by the end of next year. It seems Meta is on track to surpass this goal.While AI-powered recommendations may be the present focus, Meta has its eyes set on another component of AI work — generative AI. In Zuckerberg's Facebook post, he explains that as the technology advances, it will allow people to express themselves more creatively and enable new forms of communication and collaboration.AI Startups Turn to Retail Investors To Fund the Growth of the $1.59 Trillion Artificial Intelligence Market.© 2023 Benzinga.com.

Just adding a fraction of a here on the day, 1/10 of a percent in the green to start things off.S&P 500, you're seeing that up by about 1/10 of a percent.

Eleven S&P 500 sectors, we've got them loaded up here for you on the touch, the YFi Interactive.And XLE, as you're seeing right now out of the gate this morning, that's leading the pack. It's up 6/10 of a percent. Largely some fractional moves that we're seeing pretty much across the board. Pulling up the caboose, though, right now, technology. That is flat, just barely to the downside by about 1/10 of a percent.Let's take a look at some other technology players here. The megacap tech stocks, as of right now, a little bit mixed. Taking a look at Microsoft and Google, fractional losses there. But some gains, Amazon, that's up by about 1.3%. Of course, a company that's already reported.

META,Why the red-hot tech trade may crumble: Morning Brief,"This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can receive in your inbox every Monday to Friday by 6:30 a.m. ET along with:The chart of the dayWhat we're watchingWhat we're readingEconomic data releases and earningsMost of the Nasdaq's advance could be attributed to speculative triple-digit percentage moves in biotech stocks. But there have been a host of big moves in well-known names: Tesla is 40% on the year, Roku has clawed back 39% and Booking Holdings is up 32%.Market pros tell me the relative out-performance for tech stocks reflects two things.And two, the expectation of a Fed rate hike pause has fueled a renewed interest in the tech trade. Tech investors foam at the mouth at the idea of lower rates, and after a long series of hikes, simply not hiking has the same effect. This has proven time and time again as a key driver of tech valuation multiples.The problem is that the good times in tech stocks could be approaching some form of pause just like the rate hikes.As a result of these macro risks, the valuations on many tech stocks look extended. I think JP Morgan strategist Mislav Matejka nailed this vibe in a new client note.""Our call is that bond yields will be down further from here, but [the] tech bounce appears to have over-discounted that now. In addition, the clear and rising risk is that the Fed does not deliver on market expectations for cuts in second half of the year. Real rates could stay higher, with tech inversely correlated to them,"" Matejka said. ""With respect to the earnings outlook, consensus expectations are for the technology sector to expand its profit margins by as much as 140 basis points next year, the largest increase of all sectors, and which would put it at new all-time highs. We see risks to this, especially if the economy weakens into a downturn.""Bank of America's Michael Hartnett said on Friday in a note the tech trade could ""crack"" in large part due to a more hawkish Fed.So there is all of that.And the component here is that tech looks done with the profit-boosting expenses cuts.So investors banking on epic profits from tech in the second half of the year due to new expense savings may be let down.Bottom line: respect the tech trade, but realize nothing good lasts forever.Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance","May 15, 2023 at 8:00 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-the-red-hot-tech-trade-may-crumble-morning-brief-130045266.html,Yahoo Finance,0.0,0.3333333333333333,0.11669964955679239,0.364663986806844,2023-05-15 08:00:00,2023-05-15 08:00:00,236.9199981689453,238.8600006103516,-1.9400024414062784
META,Brokers Suggest Investing in Meta Platforms (META): Read This Before Placing a Bet,"Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?Meta Platforms currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.39, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 37 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.39 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 37 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 29 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 78.4% and 8.1% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for METADo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.Zacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABRAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Is META a Good Investment?Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for Meta Platforms, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 15% over the past month to $11.76.Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for Meta Platforms.

META,DEA administrator: Technology has 'transformed drug trafficking',"One reason for this is that social media has solved a ""last mile problem"" for cartels, Milgram explained.""They've got to get that drug into someone's hands,"" she said. ""It's that last mile, which is how a drug cartel that's making fentanyl pills in Mexico gets to a teenager... and social media has made it so much more anonymous.""""A young person will walk into their room, and open up their phone or computer… but that same young person would be really hesitant to walk into an open air drug market and buy heroin like they would have had to 20 years ago,"" Milgram added. ""It's a totally different world.”When someone dies from a drug poisoning, investigating agents will often, very early on, access their phones and social media accounts.""Our agents will go out and they'll access the victim's phone, and we'll find the deal on Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat, or TikTok,"" Milgram said.It's also a cross-platform endeavor, as one transaction can move through many different apps.""Drug traffickers are often on multiple social media sites and payment apps,"" Milgram said. ""Social media makes people feel connected for life.""However, as much as tech has been successfully leveraged by cartels, it can also be a way to spread awareness, according to Milgram.""I think tech could play a huge role in awareness, and I think it has to be part of that conversation,"" she said. ""Anything that tech can do to spread the word is vital. A young person thinks they're buying oxycontin or Xanax, but they don't know that they're buying fentanyl. Six out of ten times, that can be potentially deadly.""The DEA is also evolving to keep up with the pace of change, Milgram said.""We think about globalization and how it's changed the entire world — the cartels have just evolved their entire business model to harness encrypted applications, social media, and cryptocurrency,"" she said. ""They've taken everything they do and adapted it, whether it's recruiting couriers on social media or selling the pills on social media apps... So a big part of what we're doing is transforming the DEA to have the data and technology, so we are as prepared as possible to meet this threat.""Recently, Milgram and Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco held a meeting with senior leadership at several tech companies. Though conversations have been ongoing for some time between Big Tech and the DEA, the meeting was in-person and, in many ways, the first of its kind.""Our message was that this is an emergency and we need them to do more, like make zero tolerance part of their policy,"" she said.","May 14, 2023 at 10:34 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dea-administrator-technology-has-transformed-drug-trafficking-153410271.html,Yahoo Finance,0.0,0.0,0.11837301587301588,0.3360714285714286,2023-05-14 10:34:00,2023-05-14 10:34:00,,,
META,"Meta Platforms, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:META) Intrinsic Value Is Potentially 40% Above Its Share Price","The projected fair value for Meta Platforms is US$328 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to EquityMeta Platforms is estimated to be 29% undervalued based on current share price of US$234 See our latest analysis for Meta Platforms We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$24.4bUS$30.8bUS$34.1bUS$42.9bUS$51.7bUS$58.1bUS$63.6bUS$68.2bUS$72.1bUS$75.4bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x15Analyst x14Analyst x10Analyst x3Analyst x2Est @ 12.53%Est @ 9.41%Est @ 7.22%Est @ 5.69%Est @ 4.61% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.6% US$22.4kUS$26.1kUS$26.7kUS$30.9kUS$34.3kUS$35.5kUS$35.8kUS$35.4kUS$34.4kUS$33.2kThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 8.6%.The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$840b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$234, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 29% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.We would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Meta Platforms as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.6%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.086. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.StrengthDebt is not viewed as a risk.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.OpportunityAnnual revenue is forecast to grow faster than the American market.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?

META,Meta is banking on AI to power the future of its ads business,"""AI is definitely having its moment,"" said Meta's Head of Global Business Group Nicola Mendelsohn at the event. ""It's very much the belle of the ball, but it's actually had a place at our table right back to the early days of Feed back in 2006 ... Mark Zuckerberg just said it himself recently, that he sees that we're very much focused on two waves of tech, AI and the metaverse, and that they can actually build on each other as we use AI to power our ad system.""""These products ... help businesses really simply be able to connect the right creative, with the right audience, at the right time,"" she told the audience.""I'll give you an example,"" Mendelsohn continued. ""For Advantage+ Shopping, for an advertiser, instead of just sitting there and manually setting up loads of different campaigns, they can just set up that interval and then we can automatically then test hundreds of different combinations that saves them time. That also optimizes for the highest-performing ones and then, ultimately, what it does is to drive better outcomes.""The central product announcement of the day was called AI Sandbox, which Meta plans to start rolling out slowly in July. AI Sandbox, which specifically focuses on generative AI and how it can be applied to advertising, will include a number of features, such as the ability to create multiple versions of the same text and background, as well as ""image outcropping,"" which could help advertisers repurpose images for different formats.John Hegeman, Meta's Head of Monetization, said: ""We recognize that there are a number of tools that businesses are already using out there and will continue to use over time, as well, but what we see our unique opportunity is to tightly integrate these features over time into our products, which will allow advertisers to do a number of powerful things such as test kinds of different types of backgrounds or text variations, which could allow them to further personalize their messages or different parts of their audience.""The metaverse connection between AI and ads, while still fuzzy, is becoming clearer.""There's been a thing out there that we're not interested in the metaverse anymore,"" said Mendelsohn. ""We are really interested in the metaverse, but we're really clear that this is going to be five, 10 years before it realizes the vision of what we're talking about... In the future, say you're a company, and you want to build a world in there. At the moment, it's quite clunky to be able to do that, but in the future, utilizing things like generative AI and machine learning, you'll be able to say 'I want to build a room' and there will be lots of things that happen as a result of that tool. That's just one tiny example. I think it will have so many different applications once we're in there.""""AI will help us develop the metaverse more effectively,"" Hegeman added. ""Then the metaverse will be another great opportunity to create value for folks.""""What I'm hearing every day when I'm talking to CEOs, when I'm talking to CMOs, is that the thing that's most important to them is growth, and I hope that today shows how committed we are to helping them grow,"" Mendelsohn said at the event.","May 12, 2023 at 4:21 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meta-is-banking-on-ai-to-power-the-future-of-its-ads-business-212132613.html,Yahoo Finance,0.0,0.125,0.16618571428571427,0.47713809523809525,2023-05-12 16:21:00,2023-05-12 16:21:00,236.7400054931641,233.80999755859372,2.9300079345703693

META,3 Top Ranked Stocks for Momentum Traders to Buy,"To the surprise of nearly everyone, markets have been very strong so far this year. While many analysts had forecasts for a recession and another challenging year for the stock market, the S&P 500 is up 8% and Nasdaq 18% YTD.One way to take advantage of a market that stubbornly continues to grind higher is to focus on momentum stocks. Momentum trading is the simple concept of buying the leaders, because there is a good chance that they will continue to be the leaders. It isn’t just an aphorism either, the momentum anomaly is one of the most researched and implemented trading concepts in markets, utilized by some of the biggest funds in the world.One way to further improve your momentum trading outcomes is to focus on momentum stocks that also have high Zacks Ranks. Trading only stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), further improves your odds of buying a winner, because analysts have been upgrading earnings expectations.To improve trading odds even further, investors can buy stocks that also have high probability chart patterns. Utilizing technical chart patterns helps traders rigorously define the entry and exit signals, keeping them out of trades that don’t look right, and getting them in trades with high risk-reward setups.SkechersSkechers, founded in 1992, is an international designer, developer, marketer, and distributor of footwear. Skechers products are available in more than 170 countries with 4,549 stores, including 548 domestic stores, 927 international locations and 3,074 distributors, licensees, and franchise stores.SKX stock has had a very strong start to this year, rallying 25% in the last four months. SKX has also been a high performing stock over the last decade. Over that period, it has returned 22% annually, more than 6’xing investors’ money, and handily outperforming the broad market.However, if you look closely at the performance chart below, you will see most of those gains came in the early years of the last decade, trading mostly sideways since 2015. But, based on the current setup, SKX looks like it may be at the start of another major bull run.In the price action chart below we see SKX had built out a solid base through the first few months of the year. When a stock bases like this, it means large investors are slowly building a position. Then at the end of April the stock broke out above $50 with a convincing gap higher, that has yet to be filled.Now through May, SKX has built out a tight consolidation, bull flag from which we can measure a trade from. If SKX stock can trade above $53.50, it should break out higher, and make new all-time highs. Alternatively, if the stock trades below the bottom of the range, $51.70, the setup is invalidated.D.R. HortonD.R. Horton is one of the leading national homebuilders, primarily engaged in the construction and sale of single-family houses both in the entry-level and move-up markets. D.R. Horton’s operations are spread across 110 markets in 33 states.DHI has been a steady performing stock over the last 10 years. In that time, it has put up an annualized return of 16%, beating the index’s 12.4% annualized return.Additionally, DHI is part of the Building Products – Home Builders industry in Zacks Industry Rank. Home builders have been one of the strongest industries in the market this year, surprising most, who thought housing would get crushed as the economy slows.Nonetheless, it charges higher. Home Builders are in the top 3% of industries in the Zacks Industry Rank, considerably outperforming the market and demonstrating the momentum of the industry.D.R. Horton has a convincing technical chart pattern as well. After building and breaking out of a bull flag in the first few months of the year, DHI is coiling again for another momentum breakout. Like SKX, the stock gapped up, and is holding right near its high of the year. This is very bullish price action.If the price can break out above the $110 level, more buyers should step in and send the stock to new all-time highs. But, if the stock trades below the $106 level, the setup is invalid.Meta PlatformsMeta Platforms META is the strongest performing stock in S&P 500 this year. The stock is up a very impressive 96% YTD. Even after collapsing a brutal -75% in 2022, META stock has returned 800% over the last ten years, which is 24% annualized.Like the other stocks, META has been gapping up and holding key levels. On this chart I have marked the $220 level, which was the pre-Covid highs, an important level for many stocks.After trading through that level, META has built out a clear bull flag. If META can trade above the $240 level, it should make another push higher. Alternatively, below the $230 level and the setup is invalid.But, if the price trades below $230, and then holds the pre-Covid level of $220 it may build out a secondary base to trade from. Because META is up nearly 100% this year, it is possible the stock will take some time to rest, although the momentum is clearly strong in this one.Bottom LineWhen trading momentum stocks it is critical to set a trading plan and stick with it. Even more important is to be very mindful of risk management. Picking a stop loss and knowing exactly how much you may lose on the trade is the most important decision in the setup.Skechers U.S.A., Inc. (SKX) : Free Stock Analysis ReportD.R. Horton, Inc.

There is no in between.Talking about AI at ""Sundar Pichai I/O presentation"" levels, it seems, is good by investors.But, of course, Iger's charming retort was followed by a serious answer.Because no serious executive at this point doesn't have a response to questions about what a company's AI strategy might be.""It's pretty clear that AI developments represent some pretty interesting opportunities for us and some substantial benefits,"" Iger added. ""In fact, we're already starting to use AI to create some efficiencies and ultimately to better serve consumers. Getting closer to the customer is something that is a real goal of ours. And we think that AI will provide some great opportunities to do that.""For companies like Disney with huge libraries of intellectual property that could potentially be spoofed by new technologies, Iger added, ""our legal team is working overtime already to try to come to grips with what could be some of the challenges here.""Overall, Iger said he's ""bullish"" on the prospects for bringing AI into Disney's business.Which, of course. The technical marvel of ""Fantasia"" has already been rendered routine by technological advances; AI might make a film like this from something you could sketch out by lunch.Neils Bohr once said that predictions are hard to make, especially those about the future.But if we're indeed on the cusp of an electricity-level shift in our relationship with a certain technology then no one in business, the media, education, government, or any other institution should feel self-conscious about continually evangelizing on the power of AI. One day, that evangelism will merely be table stakes.Should AI appear more like the recent hype about ""blockchain technology"" that fizzled with the 2018-19 crypto winter, however, then today's AI discourse will be remembered largely for what it's been so far — a little annoying, a little insistent, and a bit too pat to seem like the real thing.Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance","May 12, 2023 at 8:00 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/everyone-is-getting-the-ai-revolution-wrong-morning-brief-130037420.html,Yahoo Finance,-0.25,0.6166666666666667,0.1086727666273121,0.5402548209366391,2023-05-12 08:00:00,2023-05-12 08:00:00,236.7400054931641,233.80999755859372,2.9300079345703693
META,"Investors Heavily Search Meta Platforms, Inc. (META): Here is What You Need to Know","Over the past month, shares of this social media company have returned +7%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +0.6% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Software industry, which Meta Platforms falls in, has gained 1.8%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Meta Platforms is expected to post earnings of $2.79 per share, indicating a change of +13.4% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +18% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $11.76 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +19.6%. This estimate has changed +15% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $14.62 indicates a change of +24.3% from what Meta Platforms is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +13.2%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Meta Platforms is rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Meta Platforms, the consensus sales estimate of $30.65 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +6.3%. The $126.66 billion and $140.33 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +8.6% and +10.8%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryMeta Platforms reported revenues of $28.65 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +2.6%. EPS of $2.64 for the same period compares with $2.72 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $27.49 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +4.21%. The EPS surprise was +34.69%.Over the last four quarters, Meta Platforms surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Meta Platforms is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Meta Platforms. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Meta Platforms, Inc.

META,How Much Is Mark Zuckerberg Worth?,"What started off as a campus site, Facebook had 2.96 billion monthly active users as of the end of 2022, according to the quarterly report issued in February 2023 by parent company Meta Platforms. And it's still growing, even if revenues haven't. That figure represented a year-over-year increase of 2%.The success of Facebook has landed Zuckerberg in a stratosphere he probably never envisioned reaching when he was a student at Harvard. He is among the 20 richest people in the world, with a net worth of $84 billion, according to Forbes as of May 11. At 38, he remains the youngest person in the top 20 and the only one under 45.Read on to see how he became one of the world's richest billionaires.Forbes named Mark Zuckerberg the richest U.S. entrepreneur under age 40 in 2017. At that time, Zuckerberg's net worth was $71 billion -- $57.4 billion more than the runner-up, Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz.Zuckerberg holds the titles of founder, chairman and CEO of Meta. Facebook boasts one of the largest initial public offerings in U.S. history. At the time of the 2012 IPO, the company's shares were priced at $38 each, valuing Facebook at $104 billion. Zuckerberg owned more than 503 million shares and options when the company went public, which boosted his share of the company to $16.9 billion, Forbes reported.In 2016, Zuckerberg began to sell some of his Facebook stock.The company has seen its stock drop, and rebound, a few times. In March 2018, the stock fell by almost 20% over how it handled the private data of users but recovered within two months after Zuckerberg testified before Congress and the company posted a good quarterly earnings report, according to Forbes. It fell again on disappointing earnings the following July and rebounded again in the next year. Under its umbrella, Meta Platforms includes Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, WhatsApp and Oculus. Meta's workforce grew vigorously during the pandemic, but the company announced it will shed 10,000 jobs this year. That's on top of about 11,000 cutbacks in late 2022, Reuters reported. The cuts some amid a drop in market capitalization, which dropped almost by half in 2022 from $603.49 billion in March to $315.56 billion at the end of the year but has rebounded in the first quarter of 2023.The company's headquarters are in Menlo Park, California, about 30 miles south of San Francisco, and at the edge of Silicon Valley.In 2012, Mark Zuckerberg reportedly earned about $770,000 from his Facebook salary and bonuses, according to Forbes. The following year, he slashed his annual salary to $1.Although the billionaire entrepreneur isn't earning a big salary for his day job, the company pays for some significant expenses.The Guardian reported that financial allocation for his security this year is rising from $10 million to $14 million to ""address safety concerns due to specific threats"" directly related to his job.Mark Zuckerberg possesses more wealth than most people will ever see. Rather than keep his money to himself, however, he plans to give much of it away.In 2015, Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, signed The Giving Pledge. The brainchild of Bill Gates, Melinda French Gates and Warren Buffett, The Giving Pledge calls for wealthy people to give most of their money to charitable causes.In November 2015, the Zuckerbergs had their first child, daughter Maxima. He reiterated his philanthropic intentions in a letter to his daughter that outlined her parents' hopes for her future and that of her generation. In the letter, the couple introduced the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, which focuses on the causes of personalized learning, curing disease and connecting people.In the letter, which was shared on Facebook, Chan and Zuckerberg vowed to give 99% of their Facebook shares, then valued at about $45 billion, to the mission.In August 2017, the couple announced that they had welcomed their second daughter, August.They apparently inherited their dad's early interest in computers. In summer 2021, he shared a photo on Facebook of August learning to use the computer.In a February 2022 article, Architectural Digest detailed the vast real estate holdings of Zuckerberg and Chan. They can choose to sleep in one of several homes they own in California, including in Lake Tahoe, or from properties on the Hawaiian island of Kauai. Zuckerberg has been known to buy a primary home and then snap up neighboring properties to guarantee his family's privacy.In 2011, Zuckerberg bought a 5,617-square-foot home near the Facebook offices for a reported $7 million, Architectural Digest reported. CNBC said he retrofitted it with Jarvis, a ""custom-made artificially intelligent assistant"" that started teaching Mandarin to the Zuckerbergs' oldest daughter when she was a baby.Three years later, he bought 707 acres on Kauai for about $116 million then in 2021 spent $53 million for an additional 600 acres. Zuckerberg wants to ""promote conservation, produce sustainable agriculture, and protect native wildlife at our ranch and in the surrounding areas,"" he said of the Hawaii holdings, per Architectural Digest.More From GOBankingRates5 Expensive Renovations Homeowners Always RegretFinancial Insight in Your Inbox: Sign Up for GBR's Daily Newsletter3 Ways to Recession Proof Your Retirement7 Things You Must Do To Create a Plan for Your Money","May 12, 2023 at 6:00 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/much-mark-zuckerberg-worth-110001893.html,GOBankingRates,0.25,0.15000000000000002,0.14545454545454545,0.3498484848484849,2023-05-12 06:00:00,2023-05-12 06:00:00,236.7400054931641,233.80999755859372,2.9300079345703693

META, NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, Booking Holdings Inc. BKNG and Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. CMG.Here are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:Wall Street has remained range-bound since April barring 2-3 days of rally or decline. Market participants are clueless about the health of the U.S. economy. Although several economic indicators have fallen substantially in 2023, the labor market stays resilient. Moreover, inflation is well above the Fed's 2% target rate despite a massive 5% hike in interest rate from March 2022 to May 2023.A large section of economists and financial experts have warned about a recession later this year. However, first-quarter 2023 earnings of corporate America are better-than-expected so far. In its May FOMC meeting, the Fed refrained from giving any clearcut signal regarding the end of the current rate hike regime.Investors remain directionless about the future trajectory of the U.S. stock movement. In such a situation, a good investment strategy can provide strong returns in the long term.First, select U.S. corporate behemoth (market capital > $50 billion) with a favorable Zacks Rank. These companies have an excellent business model, globally acclaimed brand value and a sound financial position. Second, select those corporate bigwigs that have flourished year to date with robust potential for the rest of 2023 and the long term (next 3 to 5 years).However, as developed regions mature, Meta Platforms has taken measures to drive penetration in the emerging markets of South East Asia, Latin America and Africa. Of all places, India deserves a-special mention in terms of user growth. The world's second-largest populated country offers tremendous potential for META. With China off the radar, India can prove to be a terrific growth engine for Meta.Zacks Rank #1 Meta Platform has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 8.6% and 19.6%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 12.6% over the last 30 days. Meta Platform has a long-term earnings growth potential of 19.5%.

The stock price of NVDA has soared 97.6% year to date.Robust Alexa skills and an expanding smart home products portfolio are positives. AMZN's strong global presence and solid momentum across small and medium businesses remain tailwinds.

Further, strengthening alternative accommodation business and flight capabilities are major positives. We expect 2023 total revenues to be up 9.5% from 2022.Zacks Rank #1 Booking Holdings has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 19.9% and 36.5%, respectively, for the current year.

META,Facebook owner Meta announces tests of generative AI ads tool,"By Katie Paul and Sheila DangNEW YORK (Reuters) - Social media giant Meta Platforms Inc joined the generative AI product race on Thursday, saying it would begin testing artificial intelligence-powered ad tools that can create content like image backgrounds and variations of written text.A select group of advertisers will be invited to experiment with the tools in a ""testing playground"" that the company is calling the AI Sandbox, Meta executives said at a press event in New York.The executives declined to specify how many advertisers would have access to the space at the outset, saying only that the group was small.Meta planned to grant access to more advertisers in July and integrate some of the features into general-purpose ad products later in the year, they said.The announcement marks the Facebook and Instagram owner's first foray into rolling out products that use generative AI technology, which mines vast stores of past data to generate new content like prose, art and software code.A frenzy of interest and investment has swirled around the technology since Microsoft-backed startup OpenAI launched chatbot ChatGPT in the fall.Meta's announcement came a day after its top digital ads rival, Alphabet's Google, said it would start offering integrations of the technology in its search, email and photo products.(Reporting by Katie Paul and Sheila Dang in New York; Editing by Marguerita Choy)","May 11, 2023 at 4:02 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/facebook-owner-meta-announces-tests-210233990.html,Reuters,0.0,0.0,0.08949494949494949,0.5009090909090909,2023-05-11 16:02:00,2023-05-11 16:02:00,233.0500030517578,235.7899932861328,-2.739990234375
META,Meta Introduces AI Tools to Create Ads and Predict Performance,"(Bloomberg) -- Meta Platforms Inc. is giving marketers artificial intelligence tools to create ads and make them more effective.Most Read from BloombergA 32-Year-Old Nears Billionaire Status by Using AI to Broker Japan MergersBiden, McCarthy Voice Cautious Optimism on Debt Deal After TalksGoogle Billionaire Sergey Brin Gifts $600 Million in Surging SharesGoldman Banker Wins Promotion, Then Leaves for Rival Two Weeks LaterDebt Deadlock Spurs Late-Day Slide in US Stocks: Markets WrapThe company Thursday introduced the “AI Sandbox” for advertisers to test early versions of features that use artificial intelligence technology. Initially, the tools will generate different text for ads that cater to various audiences, create alternate background images based on the words provided and automatically resize ad images to adjust for changes in platforms, the company said in a blog post. Meta is working with a small group of advertisers to test the tools and said it intends to gradually expand access beginning in July.Meta, which runs Facebook and Instagram, also introduced a new AI-based model that can help businesses predict the performance of ads using a bigger data set than previously. In early tests on Instagram, the technology, called Meta Lattice, increased performance for advertisers, the company said.Meta has been under pressure to rediscover growth in its core digital advertising business. Last month, the company reported that revenue increased after falling for the previous three consecutive quarters — its first ever sales declines. That first-quarter report suggests the possible end of a difficult stretch in which a choppy economy depressed marketer spending and iOS privacy changes from Apple Inc. made ads on smartphones less effective.At the same time, the tech industry writ large has been trying to feed a newly insatiable appetite for AI-based technology from clients, investors and analysts. Digital advertisers, in particular performance-focused growth marketers, have been hungry for tools that can help create ads more efficiently and make them more successful.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekEric Adams Is Starving New York City’s Universal Pre-K ProgramThe Green Energy Transition Has a Chilean Copper ProblemAI Lets Microsoft Target Google and Google Target AmazonChina’s $220 Billion Biotech Initiative Is Struggling to Take OffThe Plot to Steal the Other Secret Inside a Can of Coca-Cola©2023 Bloomberg L.P.","May 11, 2023 at 4:00 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meta-introduces-ai-tools-create-210000431.html,Bloomberg,0.0,0.0,-0.005099698281516464,0.3866325593598321,2023-05-11 16:00:00,2023-05-11 16:00:00,233.0500030517578,235.7899932861328,-2.739990234375
META,Pinterest Aspires To Do Something No Social Media Platform Ever Has done,"According to Yahoo Finance, Ready has an even bigger picture in mind as he aspires to prove that a different business model can make social media work, as opposed to the current one which at its core prays upon the darkest aspect of human nature. Needless to say, Ready is showing the kind of accountability that is greatly missed in today’s world and not just when it comes to social media. Since its inception, Pinterest has differentiated itself in many good ways, but it now has the chance of becoming the white knight of the social media universe. If Ready succeeds in creating not only an algorithm that fuels users to make their lives better outside the screen but also shows that such a morally-grounded business model can work, he can certainly be proud of having made the world a far better place than it is today.DISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

META,"The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights Meta Platforms, Fortinet, Manhattan Associates, NVIDIA and CrowdStrike Holdings","Chicago, IL – May 11, 2023 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Meta Platforms Inc. META, Fortinet Inc. FTNT, Manhattan Associates Inc. MANH, NVIDIA Corp. NVDA and CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. CRWD.Here are highlights from Wednesday’s Analyst Blog:Wall Street was range-bound in the past month as market participants remained indecisive regarding U.S. economic growth and interest rate trajectory. In its recently concluded May FOMC meeting, the Fed raised the benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to the range of 5-5.25%, marking the highest Fed Fund rate since August 2007.In first-quarter 2023, U.S. GDP growth rate came in at a moderate 1.1% compared with the consensus estimate of 2% and the fourth-quarter 2022 growth rate of 2.6%. Moreover, the Conference Board's Leading Economic Index, a gauge of future economic activity, dropped to 108.4 in March from February's revised reading of 109.7, its 12th successive monthly drop and the lowest reading since November 2020.Precipitous contraction in ISM manufacturing and services activities, a decline in orders of durable goods, a reduction in construction activities, and a freight recession are all signaling a recession later this year. Fed Chair also acknowledged that the current banking turmoil in the United States has led to tighter credit conditions, and may impact economic activities.Despite the above-mentioned headwinds, the tech-heavy has maintained its northbound journey since the beginning of 2023. Year to date, the Nasdaq Composite has rallied 16.4%. The Dow and the S&P 500 have gained 1.3% and 7.3%, respectively, in the same period.Nasdaq Composite's performance is primarily linked to the movement of interest rate. The performance of growth stocks like technology is inversely related to the interest rate trajectory. The Nasdaq Composite was the best performer in the pandemic-ridden 2020 and 2021 as the Fed kept the benchmark interest rate to almost zero.Just the opposite happened in 2022 as the central bank hiked the lending rate by a massive 4.5% to combat record-high inflation. The valuation of most of the technology behemoths plunged last year.The situation once again turned in favor of the Nasdaq Composite as Fed Chairman Jerome Powell indicated that the ongoing rate hike cycle is perhaps reaching its end, although it will depend on the outcome of economic data.However, as developed regions mature, Meta Platforms has taken measures to drive penetration in emerging markets of South East Asia, Latin America and Africa.

META,Delaware judge refuses to dismiss Facebook shareholder suit over user data privacy breaches,"DOVER, Del. (AP) — A Delaware judge on Wednesday refused to dismiss a shareholder lawsuit alleging that Facebook officers and directors violated both the law and their fiduciary duties in failing for years to protect the privacy of user data.Vice Chancellor J. Travis Laster rejected arguments that the complaint should be dismissed because the plaintiffs did not first demand that Facebook's board take legal action before filing litigation themselves. Under Delaware law, shareholders must make such a demand or demonstrate that doing so would be futile because a majority of directors were self-interested, lacked independence or faced a substantial likelihood of liability.Meta has said in filings with securities regulators that it believes the lawsuit is without merit.In refusing to dismiss the lawsuit, the judge noted that he was required to accept the allegations in the complaint, which he described as “encyclopedic and specific” as true for purposes of ruling on the motion.""It tells a story of directors who were on notice of the law breaking, and who either affirmatively went along with it or consciously disregarded it,” Laster said. “What we don’t have is a little lawbreaking, what we don’t have is isolated lawbreaking, what we don’t have are immaterial violations. ... This is a case involving alleged wrongdoing on a truly colossal scale.”The complaint alleges that Facebook officials repeatedly and continually violated a 2012 consent order with the Federal Trade Commission under which the company agreed to stop collecting personal data on platform users and friends without their consent, and sharing it with the third-party applications.While allowing the plaintiffs to pursue their claims that Zuckerberg and several others breached their fiduciary duties to the company, Laster dismissed insider trading claims against several defendants, with the exception of Zuckerberg. The plaintiffs are seeking damages awarded to the company, disgorgement of profits allegedly made through insider trading and corporate governance reforms.","May 10, 2023 at 6:47 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/delaware-judge-refuses-dismiss-facebook-234749091.html,AP Finance,0.0,0.0,0.012499999999999997,0.30043859649122806,2023-05-10 18:47:00,2023-05-10 18:47:00,236.1699981689453,233.0800018310547,3.089996337890625
META,Facebook Must Face Privacy Suit Over Cambridge Analytica,"(Bloomberg) -- A judge ruled Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and former directors of the social-media company must face claims they turned a blind eye to rampant privacy violations, including allowing a firm hired by Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign to collect data on millions of users.Most Read from BloombergTurkey Latest: Erdogan Says Unclear If Vote Will Go to RunoffTurkey Set for Runoff as Erdogan Falls Just Short of VictoryS&P ETF Barely Budges on Yellen’s Late-Day Notice: Markets WrapChicago’s Empty Office Towers Threaten Its Future as a Major Financial HubMicrosoft’s $69 Billion Activision Deal Wins EU ApprovalDelaware Chancery Court Judge Travis Laster concluded Wednesday that alleged conflicts-of-interest meant Facebook’s board couldn’t be trusted to properly investigate claims the company repeatedly violated promises to protect users’ personal information.Facebook directors either “affirmatively went along with” improper behavior or ignored it, the judge said in an oral ruling. “There were a string of red flags that were readily apparent” and weren’t acted upon, Laster said.The privacy suits by investors were tied to a record $5 billion fine officials of Facebook — now a unit of Meta Platforms Inc. — paid the US government to resolve a privacy probe tied to a 2018 revelation about its business with Cambridge Analytica, a consulting firm hired by Trump.The government investigation stemmed from evidence Cambridge improperly obtained data on tens of millions of Facebook users from a researcher who collected personal data through a third-party quiz app. The app not only collected its users’ data, but also information on their friends, affecting millions of consumers.Accounts HarvestedAn internal review by Facebook later determined at least 50 million user accounts were improperly harvested by Cambridge, according to investors’ court filings.In December, Meta agreed to pay $725 million to settle investor claims in California tied to the Cambridge scandal.Dave Arnold, a Facebook spokesman, declined to comment on Laster’s ruling.The Cambridge scandal dealt a blow to Facebook’s reputation at a time when the company was already under fire for allowing Russian agents to exploit its platform to try to influence the 2016 election. But Facebook investors contend the privacy violations stretched back four years before the Cambridge news became public.They noted the US Federal Trade Commission found alleged violations going back to 2012 — the same year that Facebook finalized an earlier agreement over privacy lapses. Four months after that accord, the FTC said, Facebook removed a disclosure that information users shared with friends could get sucked up by apps those friends used — while allowing the practice to continue.Making BillionsFacebook shareholders alleged in their suits company directors acquiesced to the violations to help the company make billions in advertising and data sales instead of insuring the firm protected users.“This complete and utter failure of leadership and governance left Facebook subject to public scrutiny, billions of dollars in lost market value, millions of dollars in foreseeable fines and costs, and inquiries by governments worldwide,” investors said in court filings.In his ruling, Laster noted investors allege Facebook officials agreed to pay more in the FTC settlement to protect Zuckerberg from facing personal liability in the cases. Some company shareholders allege the social-media giant may have paid as much as $2 billion extra to protect the founder. The judge said if that allegation is true, it would support “a claim for waste” of corporate assets.Laster also noted that Facebook directors, including venture-capital titans Mark Andreessen and Peter Thiel, were warned by the company’s internal security experts that users’ personal data was being handled improperly. Instead of acting to ensure controls were tightened, they stood by as the head of computer security was removed.The case is IN RE Facebook Derivative Litigation, 2018-0307, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington)--With assistance from Alex Barinka.(Updates with excerpts from judge’s ruling starting in 12th paragraph)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekEric Adams Is Starving New York City’s Universal Pre-K ProgramAI Lets Microsoft Target Google and Google Target AmazonThe Plot to Steal the Other Secret Inside a Can of Coca-ColaChina’s $220 Billion Biotech Initiative Is Struggling to Take OffHow Normalizing Menopause Can Help Employers Retain Senior Women©2023 Bloomberg L.P.","May 10, 2023 at 4:23 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/facebook-must-face-privacy-suit-212301567.html,Bloomberg,0.0,0.0,0.003767217630853996,0.2917493112947659,2023-05-10 16:23:00,2023-05-10 16:23:00,236.1699981689453,233.0800018310547,3.089996337890625
META,Why Meta's digital ad numbers are trouncing competitors right now: Nicola Mendelsohn,"Meta's ad revenue numbers were a notable beat, coming in at $28.1 billion versus the $26.7 billion that Wall Street was expecting. That suggests that, at least for Meta, digital advertisers are finding their way forward.Though Alphabet clocked a small beat on its YouTube ad revenue and expressed some optimism about a stabilizing ad market, that optimism didn't exist across the board. For example, in the company's earnings call, the Google parent's chief business officer Philipp Schindler noted that ""in network, there was an incremental pullback in advertiser spend.""At Roku, it was a similar story of choppy waters in digital advertising; ad spending in some areas improved, but other areas remained pressured.Why was Meta's story more positive? In part, it was tied to the increasing success of new products such as Reels and investments in AI, Mendelsohn said.""[Reels is] one of our fastest growing products, and what we saw just in the last handful of months was a doubling of the amount of Reels being shared every day to 2 billion Reels being shared,"" she said. ""That's people commenting and sharing and discussing and debating and really enjoying the content that they're seeing. A lot of that has been powered by the investments that we've been making in artificial intelligence and machine learning.""Mendelsohn also identified messaging as a key ad opportunity, especially for WhatsApp, Instagram Direct, and Messenger.""We're seeing that one of the products that have that we call [Click to Message] actually enables advertisers to start a conversation in one of the individual threads,"" she said. ""That now has a runway of $10 billion.""Meta's goal is, in large part, to make it easy for advertisers to use its platforms, according to Mendelsohn.To that end, Mendelsohn also delineated how AI, a key theme that CEO Mark Zuckerberg spoke about in the company's latest earnings call, fits into Meta's advertising strategy.Meta's automated Advantage+ ad products are AI-powered, and they're ""helping advertisers that want a reduction in the cost to actually reach the people that matter to them,"" Mendelsohn said. She explained that Meta, which has been using AI in one form or another since 2006, uses the technology in three ways.""We use it to surface and bubble up the best content for you, that you, the individual among those 3.8 billion people, see the things that matter most to you,"" Mendelsohn said.""We also use it to take content off the platform, any type of harmful content, misinformation. We're doing that through machine learning and AI,"" she added. ""Then, finally, from the advertising side and monetization of our products, then it's really about making sure we put the right products in front of the right people at the right time.""Between Meta's AI-infused ad products and its focus on efficiency this year, some on Wall Street have taken notice.Click here for the latest technology business news, reviews, and useful articles on tech and gadgetsRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance","May 10, 2023 at 10:59 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-metas-digital-ad-numbers-are-trouncing-competitors-right-now-nicola-mendelsohn-155924039.html,Yahoo Finance,0.14285714285714285,0.26785714285714285,0.16136918636918635,0.48204110704110703,2023-05-10 10:59:00,2023-05-10 10:59:00,236.1699981689453,233.0800018310547,3.089996337890625
META,How Meta's using AI on Facebook and Instagram,"Key video moments:00:00:25 Facebook’s growing reach00:01:15 who’s winning ad wars00:04:30 how Meta is using AIAnd if I break down just some of those numbers a bit further and I think about something like Facebook in the US, you're now seeing 200 million people coming on every single day. That's the largest it's ever been. So I think it starts with the growth of the community. And then I think that's backed up, in turn, by how we're seeing the advertising revenues, which it's been our highest Q1 ever.And they want to know from us, what are the new products? And we've got a lot of new products that I'm really excited about that, I think, have in part contributed to that growth.And a lot of that's been powered by the investments that we've been making in artificial intelligence and machine learning. So that's one. That's a really exciting one.The second one is around messaging. Messaging, and we have with WhatsApp and Instagram Direct and also Messenger as well, 3 really exciting messaging platforms for advertisers to be able to reach people in new and different and varied ways. And we're seeing that one of the products that we have that we call Click To actually enables advertisers to start a conversation in one of the individual threads. That now has a run rate of $10 billion.Yeah, and I travel a lot with my role. It's a global role. And I've been in Brazil. I've been in Singapore. I've been in India. I've been in Korea. And it's been really interesting to see some of the use cases that we're seeing there with some of the large businesses and advertisers, one of which was JioMart, where they've basically built a whole supermarket with 20,000 SKUs right in WhatsApp where a person can go in, can pick the groceries, can arrange the delivery and the payment all within the individual thread and then, of course, do the same thing again next week.So it's really exciting to see the growth of some of those products. And then finally, we are here at Milken. Everybody's talking about AI here, right? So we launched last August a whole suite of AI-powered products called our Advantage Plus products. And this is really helping advertisers to get the performance that they want with a reduction in the cost to actually reach the people that matter to them.And these are different products that we've got across the way in which to reach people, the way in which to measure, and the types of creative the advertisers can put out there. And they do a number of different things. But ultimately, it's about giving that strong ROI and reducing the amount of manual steps that it takes for a person to put a campaign on our platform. So this is the beginning of a really exciting journey for us in this area.We also use it to take away off the platform any type of harmful content, misinformation. We're doing that through machine learning and AI. And then finally from the advertising side and the monetization of our products, then it really is about making sure that we put the right products in front of the right people at the right time. So those are the different ways that we're using it today.I think there's very few CEOs that are bold enough and brave enough to put a bet on something that could be five and 10 years out. And so I feel very excited of how that community will move through the different phases that we've seen of digital to be where we are today to ultimately where we're all be in some type of virtual reality experience as well in the future also. So yeah, I feel very excited.And it's been wonderful to see younger members of my family put on their-- and travel to places that they've never been to, having a deep sea dive experience, climbing Machu Picchu from the living room at home, right? I mean, I think that's amazing. And that's what we can do today.I think about how it's going to change the way in which we collaborate and ideate in the world of work and then also in the way that people will be able to socialize. I think about things like pop concerts or football matches, always the preserve of the very few now being able to be opened up to so many more people to have those sorts of experience.And of course, the whole environment, the new jobs that are going to be created for individuals, for creators, for people with followers, types of jobs that we cannot even imagine yet. And one of my favorite new jobs that I'm hearing about is--And I think what I've learned through all of this is to not be afraid to be vulnerable. If you're vulnerable, people will be vulnerable back. But I think it's also important to give people hope. I'm absolutely determined to find a cure for this cancer. And if there is anybody out there that wants to go on a journey with me on this, I've found people at Milken to be unbelievably helpful here.And I am all in. And I want to hear from you. But I think it's about, yes, acknowledge the difficulties that you're in. But also make sure to paint the north star and the horizon of where you are going to get to. My horizon, I'm going to find a cure for this disease.","May 10, 2023 at 10:41 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/metas-using-ai-facebook-instagram-154143669.html,Yahoo Finance Video,0.0,0.0,0.13939112378136767,0.541593944673213,2023-05-10 10:41:00,2023-05-10 10:41:00,236.1699981689453,233.0800018310547,3.089996337890625

META,"Warren Buffett Says, 'There's Nothing Better' Than This Strategy If You 'Do It At The Right Price.' Here Are 3 Companies Leading The Pack In This Area","Companies can allocate their funds in various ways to create shareholder value. But in the eyes of legendary investor Warren Buffett, one method stands out above all others.“If you do it at the right price, there’s nothing better than buying in your own business,” the Berkshire Hathaway CEO said during his company’s annual shareholders meeting in 2022.Buffett was referring to stock buybacks. Basically, a company can repurchase its own shares from the open market, effectively reducing the number of shares outstanding. Consequently, the remaining shareholders get to own a larger portion of the company as their relative ownership stake increases.He used American Express as an example to illustrate the power of buybacks.Buffett mentioned that Berkshire purchased its last share of American Express around 1998, owning 11.2% of the payments company at the time.“And now we own 20% of American Express. That’s what’s happened because they repurchased shares,” he explained.“It’s a wonderful thing if you’ve got an asset you like and they take your ownership interest up.”These days, companies flush with cash are spending billions of dollars on buybacks. Here's a look at three that are particularly generous.Don't miss:'People-First' Real Estate Fund Shares Rent With Tenants While Generating Strong Returns For InvestorsTechies Will Soon Flood Austin Even Harder. Here's How To Invest In Its Real Estate Before That HappensAccording to S&P Global, Apple spent $94.1 billion on buybacks in 2022, up from the $88.3 billion it spent in 2021.But it shouldn’t come as a surprise. Commanding a market capitalization of $2.75 trillion, Apple reigns as the largest company in the U.S.It’s known for having a huge cash pile. According to the latest earnings report, Apple’s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $166.3 billion as of April 1.Apple also happens to be a Buffett favorite — it is the largest publicly traded holding in Berkshire’s portfolio.“We knew that we would own an even greater interest if they kept buying in their shares, which — we didn’t have any insider information or anything — but certainly, it would seem the way to bet,” Buffett said about Apple at Berkshire’s shareholders' meeting last year.As the parent company of Google, Alphabet was created in 2015 to give Google’s wild ideas some room to play. The company boasts a vast array of ventures, from dominating the search engine market to dabbling in self-driving cars and life sciences.S&P Global reports that Alphabet’s buybacks totaled $59.3 billion in 2022, marking an increase from the 2021 figure of $50.3 billion.Despite being a tech behemoth, Alphabet stock has been volatile: Shares have climbed 20% in 2023 but are still down about 4% compared to a year ago.Some consider the increasing popularity of OpenAI's chatbot ChatGPT a threat to Alphabet's business. But Alphabet is not standing still, as the company is also advancing its own artificial intelligence (AI) products.“In March, we introduced our experimental conversational AI service called Bard,” Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said in the latest earnings conference call. “We've since added our PaLM model to make it even more powerful, and Bard can now help people with programming and software development tasks, including code generation.”Shares of Facebook parent Meta Platforms had a rough ride in 2022, and the company took advantage of the lower prices through buybacks. According to S&P Global, Meta repurchased $31.6 billion worth of its shares last year.And now, the stock is making a comeback. Year to date, Meta shares have surged more than 80%.A solid first-quarter report helped boost the stock’s appeal. For the quarter, the company earned a profit of $2.20 per share on $28.65 billion of revenue. Both numbers beat Wall Street’s expectations.Meta also continued to expand its user base. In the first quarter, Facebook’s monthly active users grew by 2% year over year, reaching 2.99 billion. Across its family of apps, Meta’s family monthly active people rose 5% year over year to 3.81 billion.Remember, Buffett mentioned that buybacks should be done “at the right price.” So the fact that a company is spending big dollars on buybacks doesn’t automatically make it a good investment.Read next: While REITs Are Struggling, Private Market Real Estate Pulls In Huge ReturnsHow These Accredited Investors Pulled In Better Returns Than Warren Buffett.© 2023 Benzinga.com.

META,5 Must-Buy Nasdaq Listed Technology Stocks to Tap the Rally,"Wall Street was rangebound in the past month as market participants remained indecisive regarding U.S. economic growth and interest rate trajectory. In its recently concluded May FOMC meeting, the Fed raised the benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to the range of 5-5.25%, marking the highest Fed Fund rate since August 2007.In first-quarter 2023, U.S. GDP growth rate came in at a moderate 1.1% compared with the consensus estimate of 2% and the fourth-quarter 2022 growth rate of 2.6%. Moreover, the Conference Board’s Leading Economic Index, a gauge of future economic activity, dropped to 108.4 in March from February’s revised reading of 109.7, its 12th successive monthly drop and the lowest reading since November 2020.Precipitous contraction in ISM manufacturing and services activities, a decline in orders of durable goods, a reduction in construction activities, and a freight recession are all signaling a recession later this year. Fed Chair also acknowledged that the current banking turmoil in the United States has led to tighter credit conditions, and may impact economic activities.Despite the above-mentioned headwinds, the tech-heavy has maintained its northbound journey since the beginning of 2023. Year to date, the Nasdaq Composite has rallied 16.4%. The Dow and the S&P 500 have gained 1.3% and 7.3%, respectively, in the same period.Nasdaq Composite’s performance is primarily linked to the movement of interest rate. The performance of growth stocks like technology is inversely related to the interest rate trajectory. The Nasdaq Composite was the best performer in the pandemic-ridden 2020 and 2021 as the Fed kept the benchmark interest rate to almost zero.Just the opposite happened in 2022 as the central bank hiked the lending rate by a massive 4.5% to combat record-high inflation. The valuation of most of the technology behemoths plunged last year.The situation once again turned in favor of the Nasdaq Composite as Fed Chairman Jerome Powell indicated that the ongoing rate hike cycle is perhaps reaching its end, although it will depend on the outcome of economic data.The chart below shows thw price performance of our five picks year to date.However, as developed regions mature, Meta Platforms has taken measures to drive penetration in emerging markets of South East Asia, Latin America and Africa.

TSLA,Tesla (TSLA) Up 8.5% Since Last Earnings Report: Can It Continue?,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Tesla (TSLA). Shares have added about 8.5% in that time frame, outperforming the S&P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Tesla due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Tesla reported first-quarter 2023 earnings of 85 cents per share, down from the year-ago figure of 1.07 cents but outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 83 cents. This marked an earnings beat for the EV behemoth for the ninth time in a row. Higher-than-expected revenues from its Energy Generation/Storage and Services/Other segments resulted in this outperformance.Total revenues came in at $23,329 million, witnessing year-over-year growth of 24%. However, the top line missed the consensus mark of $23,472 million. Tesla reported an overall gross margin of 19.3% for the reported quarter. The operating margin came in at 11.4%.Management sticks to its target of around 50% growth in deliveries in the foreseeable future. For 2023, it expects deliveries to reach 1.8 million units.Tesla’s production and delivery totaled 440,808 and 422,875 vehicles, reflecting a year-over-year jump of 44% and 36%, respectively. The Model 3/Y registered production and deliveries of 421,371 and 412,180 vehicles, respectively, marking year-over-year growth of 45% and 40%, respectively. Production and delivery of the Model S/X totaled 19,437 and 10,695 units, respectively, in the quarter under review.Total automotive revenues of $19,963 million, jumping 18% year over year. The reported figure also included $521 million from the sale of regulatory credits for electric vehicles, which dipped 23% year over year. Automotive sales, excluding revenues from leasing and regulatory credits, totaled $18,878 million, missing the consensus mark of $20,818 million.Automotive gross profit came in at $4,208 million, which missed the consensus mark of $4,792 million. Automotive gross margin came in at 21.1%, down from 32.9% reported in first-quarter 2022.Energy Generation and Storage revenues came in at $1,529 million in first-quarter 2023 compared with the year-ago quarter’s figure of $616 million. The figure beat the consensus mark of $1,071 million. Services and Other revenues were $1,837 million, significantly increasing from $1,279 million a year ago. The figure also topped the consensus mark of $1,595 million.Operating expenses totaled $1,847 million in the reported quarter, down from $1,857 million incurred in the corresponding period of 2022.Tesla had cash and cash equivalents of $22,402 million as of Mar 31, 2023 compared with $22,185 million on Dec 31, 2022. Net cash provided by operating activities amounted to $2,513 million in first-quarter 2023, declining 37% year over year. Its capital expenditure totaled $2,072 million compared with $1,767 million recorded in first-quarter 2022.Tesla generated a free cash flow of $441 million during the reported quarter, falling 80% year over year. Long-term debt and finance leases, net of the current portion, totaled $1,272 million, down from $1,597 million on Dec 31, 2022.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in estimates review.The consensus estimate has shifted -13.39% due to these changes.VGM ScoresAt this time, Tesla has a nice Growth Score of B, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with an F. However, the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of D. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, Tesla has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.Tesla, Inc.

TSLA,"Is Trending Stock Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) a Buy Now?","Shares of this electric car maker have returned +8.5% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.2% change. The Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry, to which Tesla belongs, has lost 4.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Tesla is expected to post earnings of $0.83 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +9.2%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -13.4%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.58 points to a change of -12% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -11%.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.74 indicates a change of +32.4% from what Tesla is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -6.9%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Tesla is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Tesla, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $24.4 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +44.1%. For the current and next fiscal years, $99.41 billion and $124.89 billion estimates indicate +22% and +25.6% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryTesla reported revenues of $23.33 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +24.4%. EPS of $0.85 for the same period compares with $1.07 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $23.59 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -1.11%. The EPS surprise was +2.41%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Tesla is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Tesla. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Tesla, Inc.

TSLA,"Tesla 'serious' on establishing India production, innovation base, minister says","By Munsif Vengattil and Aditya KalraNEW DELHI (Reuters) - Tesla Inc is ""serious"" about its plans to establish a manufacturing base in India, the country's deputy minister for technology told Reuters in an interview on Friday, a day after meeting senior executives of the electric vehicle maker.The Elon Musk led U.S. automaker held talks with Indian officials this week on various topics including incentives for car and battery manufacturing, Reuters reported on Thursday, as Tesla looks anew at entering the Indian market.""They are very seriously looking at India as a production and innovation base,"" Rajeev Chandrasekhar said in the first public comment by an Indian government official on the talks.""We have signalled to them that the government of India is working together (and) will certainly make whatever ambitions they have or investment objective they have in India a success,"" said Chandrasekhar, who is one of the highest-ranking officials in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's administration.Tesla proposed setting up a factory in India to build electric vehicles (EVs) and is also looking at manufacturing EV batteries, Reuters reported.Asked if talks with Tesla included more than just making vehicles, Chandrasekhar said ""you don't talk about cars alone"" when such discussions take place.""You talk about cars, you talk about energy, you talk about manufacturing technology.

TSLA,Britain should not join the gigafactory stampede: technology is already vaulting far ahead,"Solid state batteries for electric vehicles will start to enter our consciousness within two or three years. Hi-tech pioneers will be rolling out the first commercial products by the late 2020s.Progress will be jerky but this leap-frog technology promises a radical improvement in the range, weight, and cost of EV batteries, disrupting the global car industry and its existing supply chains.Europe is in the same trouble. Its car manufacturers cannot meet the 45pc rule either and would therefore face the same 10pc tariff trying to sell into the UK’s market. The European car lobby ACEA has called for a three-year delay.This scare has, however, shone light on Britain’s failure to deliver on chest-beating plans to turn the country into a global hub for EV batteries by the early 2020s, always a big ask given the voracious energy needs of lithium-ion manufacturing colliding with the UK’s nose-bleed electricity prices.“We lost that window of opportunity. We already are behind East Asia. We're already behind continental Europe. The UK, unfortunately, has lost out, or is losing out, on the gigafactory economy,” he told Sky News.Professor David Bailey from Birmingham Business School said policy has been a sorry saga. “You would have thought they’d seen this coming. You can’t build a gigafactory without the government playing a role but they scrapped the UK’s industrial policy,” he said.Prof Bailey said the state needs to mobilise billions, not hundreds of millions, offering cheap long-term credit from the UK Infrastructure Bank, and taking a direct equity stake if need be. It should copy Germany’s energy compensation scheme to hold down power costs for industry. “If we don’t make batteries in the UK at scale, we won’t have a car industry,” he said.I share his frustration but I do not think the UK should join the subsidy auction and spend billions trying to play catch up at this late stage. Nor do I think that the picture is as dire as it looks.Furthermore, Europe is scarcely in better shape. The European Federation for Transport and Environment says 70pc of Europe’s gigafactories risk being cancelled, scaled down, or delayed because of bureaucracy, or because companies are pulling out to chase better pickings in America. The Inflation Reduction Act offers subsidies and unlimited tax credits that can amount to $10 billion per gigafactory.Volkswagen and Freyr Battery have both switched to the US. Tesla has scaled back plans in Germany to concentrate on its expansion in Nevada.French taxpayers will have to pay for that (if allowed under state aid rules) since the EU does not have serious money. Its Net Zero Industry Act has proved a damp squib. The Brussels think tank Bruegel said it was rich on pieties but short on delivery. “Those who oppose the proposal will possibly be relieved when they understand that it will cost nothing and achieve nothing,” it said acidly.Either the EU’s strategy will prove a white elephant, in which case Britain should avoid the same mistake. Or it will succeed and there will be plenty of locally-made batteries for sale in Europe, in which case we can buy them.The UK is undoubtedly in an awkward position as the US, the EU, and China retreat into fortress blocs. But the post-war trading system is not yet dead – and may not die – and we should not lose sight of Ricardo’s comparative advantage. Industrial sovereignty is bad economics.There is a happy medium between Gallic dirigisme and free market fundamentalism. The UK should pursue a surgical industrial strategy targeting only what it is very good at and where there is a chance of world class clusters: compound semiconductors and chip design; artificial intelligence; nuclear fusion and small modular reactors; and futuristic batteries beyond lithium-ion.We should leave low-margin status quo stuff to those infatuated with gigafactories: we should back new precious stuff to the hilt.

Is this bad news for ...,"Elon Musk is not often one to shy away from expressing himself, even if his statements drum up controversy, which at times has been costly.Tweeting is Musk’s preferred medium of communication, and he had already established a track record of questionable behavior on Twitter long before he purchased the social media platform last year.In 2018, his tweet about “funding secured” for a potential acquisition of Tesla attracted a lawsuit from the Securities and Exchange Commission. He also called British caver Vernon Unsworth a “pedo guy” that same year, which resulted in another lawsuit.Since then, the tech billionaire has authored tweets that mocked Bill Gates’s personal appearance, compared Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to Adolf Hitler and taunted a disabled ex-Twitter employee. Most recently, he compared billionaire George Soros, who recently divested his stake in Tesla, to comic book supervillain Magneto.Musk’s comments have attracted criticism from journalists, business peers and some world leaders. However, his recent remark about “losing money” could be a nod to the fact that the comments are making a dent in his various businesses.Musk’s brazen communication style hasn’t traditionally impacted any of his various businesses. Tesla’s valuation has been strong over the past five years, while SpaceX has retained most of its government and commercial contracts. But there are some signs that this could be changing.Tesla stock has lost more than 25% of its value over the past twelve months. The stock is also trading about 57% lower than its all-time high.“This is going to be a challenging 12 months, I want to be sort of realistic about it,” he said during Tesla’s annual shareholders meeting May 16.Perhaps in an attempt to salvage the situation, Musk recently announced new upcoming models, a new CEO for Twitter and a reversal of his stance against TV advertising.With renewed focus, Tesla could sail through rough waters as it has several times in the past.

TSLA,Billionaire David Teppers 2023 Portfolio: Top 15 Stock Picks,"After a tumultuous 2022 and a start to 2023 that saw markets focus on whether the Federal Reserve would finally end its interest rate hiking cycle and if this would cause a recession, over the past couple of months a new complication has made its way into the financial markets. This is the U.S. debt ceiling, and it sits right at the heart of the American economy and by extension, the global economy. The debt ceiling is decided by Congress, and it serves as a check for the executive branch - or the Treasury Department under the President - to limit the amount of money that it can borrow to meet debt repayments.The back and forth between the president and Congress for this ceiling has often created turmoil in the financial market. In fact, this tussle also caused S&P Global Ratings to downgrade U.S. government debt to AA+ from AAA in 2011 - the first and only time in history that America received a downgrade which is often reserved for developing countries with fiscal mismanagement. The impact of this downgrade on the stock markets was immediate, with all major indexes declining by as much as seven percent in the aftermath.Our Methodology Appaloosa Management's Q1 2023 Investment: $31 million Tesla, Inc.

TSLA,10 Stocks to Sell in 2023 According to Billionaire Steve Cohen,"Cohen expressed his belief that the emerging field of artificial intelligence will likely generate new employment opportunities. Although he expressed concerns about the potential displacement of certain jobs, he anticipates that overall profit margins will improve. This improvement would alleviate the need for the Federal Reserve to implement further interest rate hikes as a measure to control inflation. As a result, Cohen expects that such a scenario would positively impact the markets and contribute to their growth. Steve Cohen said he is “actually pretty bullish”. Our Methodology For this list, we selected the most popular stocks removed from billionaire Steve Cohen’s 13F portfolio during the first quarter of 2023. Cohen's fund sold its entire stakes in these companies in the March quarter. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders in each firm as of Q4 2022. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 46Albemarle Corporation (NYSE:ALB) specializes in the development, production, and distribution of specialized chemicals for various industries. The company is divided into three main segments - Lithium, Bromine, and Catalysts. In Q4 2022, Steve Cohen owned 64,962 shares of Albemarle Corporation (NYSE:ALB), worth $14 million. In Q1 2023, the billionaire disposed of his entire stake in the company. He also discarded his stakes in Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL).On May 11, KeyBanc last night upgraded Albemarle Corporation (NYSE:ALB) to Overweight from Sector Weight with a $270 price target. The analyst believes that the risk/reward ratio for lithium has improved following the company's recent earnings report. They anticipate an upturn in demand for lithium in China, which has been experiencing a downturn since November 2022. According to channel checks conducted within the Chinese lithium industry, inventories at the battery cell and electric vehicle levels are declining and expected to reach a low point in the next few months. The analyst suggests that this could lead to a resumption of purchase orders from major buyers in the near future.Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 54Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) operates a platform that allows hosts worldwide to offer accommodations and experiences to guests. Using a marketplace model, the company's platform enables hosts and guests to connect and book spaces and experiences online or through mobile devices. In Q4 2022, Cohen owned 314,926 shares of Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) worth nearly $27 million, which he sold in the first quarter of 2023. On May 9, Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) reported a Q1 GAAP EPS of $0.18 and a revenue of $1.82 billion, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.08 and $30 million, respectively. During the first quarter, the total number of active listings increased by 18% compared to the same period in the previous year. This growth rate was higher than the 16% recorded in the fourth quarter of 2022.RBC Capital analyst Brad Erickson lowered the firm's price target on Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB) on May 10 to $105 from $135 and kept a Sector Perform rating on the shares. Although the company's Q1 earnings exceeded expectations, the management's guidance for Q2 Nights fell well below the consensus. Erickson anticipates that there will be greater pressure on the marginal Average Daily Rate in the future. Due to the company's high valuation and a clearer understanding of the structural limits on room night growth, RBC prefers to wait for a more significant pullback before recommending a more positive stance on Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB)’s stock.“Top contributors to performance for the quarter included online travel marketplace Airbnb, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB). Airbnb outperformed on the resilience of the travel category including for long-term stays, and on operating leverage as cost optimization is met with revenue increases. Notably, our top four holdings entering the quarter (Sea, Meli, Nvidia, Airbnb) which represented 24.37% of capital on December 31, 2022, increased an average of 64.42% during the quarter.”Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 70PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) has been distributing cash dividends every quarter since 1965, and the year 2023 signifies the 51st consecutive year in which the company has raised its annual dividend, making it a dividend king. On May 2, PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) declared a $1.265 per share quarterly dividend, a 10% increase from its prior dividend of $1.150. The dividend is payable on June 30, to shareholders of record as of June 2. Although PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) has a strong history of paying dividends, Steve Cohen sold all of his shares in the company during the first quarter of 2023, worth approximately $80 million as of Q4 2022. On April 27, Barclays raised the firm's price target on PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) to $206 from $201 and maintained an Overweight rating on the shares. According to the analyst, the company increased its organic sales and core profit growth projections after its Q1 earnings report.“PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) announced that it will commit $3.3 million in funds toward water replenishment projects across North America. These projects aim to reduce absolute water use and replenish back into the local watershed more than 100% of the water used at company-owned and third-party sites in high water-risk areas.”Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 70Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) develops solutions that empower merchants to receive payments via card and also offer reporting and analysis features, as well as prompt settlement on the following day. The company increased its projections for 2023 and reported Q1 earnings that surpassed expectations. In the fourth quarter of 2022, Cohen held 587,303 shares of the company worth $37 million. However, during the first quarter of 2023, the billionaire sold all of his shares in Block, Inc. (NYSE: SQ). On May 11, CLSA analyst John Marrin downgraded Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) to Underperform from Buy with a price target of $63, down from $93, and expressed concerns about the macro environment that outweigh the firm's optimism about the company's long-term growth potential. The analyst believes that there is a growing likelihood of a ""hard landing"" in the U.S. during the latter half of 2023, as regional banks' withdrawal puts more pressure on consumers and small businesses, who are already struggling with high interest rates. Despite posting decent earnings last week, Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ)’s stock performance has trailed the market, and investors may already be anticipating lower earnings in 2024, the analyst wrote in the research note.“Block, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) provides point-of-sale technology to small businesses and operates the Cash App ecosystem of financial services for individuals. Shares fell due to mixed quarterly results with more modest growth in the Seller business offsetting strength in Cash App. While integration of recently acquired Afterpay is progressing well and credit metrics remain healthy, the buy-now-pay-later business slowed due to greater competitive intensity. We continue to own the stock due to Block’s long runway for growth, sustainable competitive advantages, and unique corporate culture.”Given this cash-generation power, we are naturally drawn to what we believe are strong and profitable financial institutions when the price is right. Presently, we believe the valuations of our financial holdings are not only reasonable, but extremely compelling, and our portfolio composition reflects this view. Representative financial holdings in the Fund include Wells Fargo.”Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 83Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) offers online reservation services for travel and restaurants worldwide. These services include accommodation reservations through Booking.com, rental car reservations through Rentalcars.com, travel reservation services, hotel distribution services, and vacation packages and cruises through Priceline, as well as flight, ground transportation, and activities reservation services through Agoda. The company also operates KAYAK, an online meta-search service, and OpenTable for booking online restaurant reservations. In Q4 2022, Cohen owned 66,448 shares of Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG), worth $134 million. In the first quarter of 2023, he dumped his stake entirely. On May 4, Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) reported a Q1 non-GAAP EPS of $11.60 and a revenue of $3.78 billion, outperforming Wall Street consensus by $0.86 and $30 million, respectively. Revenue for the period climbed 40% on a year-over-year basis. Deutsche Bank raised the firm's price target on Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) on May 8 to $3,000 from $2,910 and maintained a Buy rating on the shares following the Q1 results.“We did have several strong performing stocks this quarter. Our top contributors to return included NVR, Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft and Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG), all of which posted double-digit gains.Online travel services provider Booking Holdings reported strong results in the quarter with gross bookings well above pre-pandemic levels. In addition, the outlook for consumer travel continued to be relatively strong. We exited our position in Booking as its share price approached our estimate of intrinsic value, reallocating funds to more deeply discounted opportunities.”  Suggested articles:10 Best Diversified Bank Stocks to Buy NowWarren Buffett’s $5.7 Billion Dividend Portfolio: Top 15 PicksMilitary Spending by Country in 2023: 20 Largest Defense Budgets ","May 18, 2023 at 2:34 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-stocks-sell-2023-according-193432788.html,Insider Monkey,0.0,0.0,0.11870580808080808,0.39626198622166364,2023-05-18 14:34:00,2023-05-18 14:34:00,174.22000122070312,176.88999938964844,-2.6699981689453125

TSLA,US lawmakers want to make sure AM radio lives on in electric vehicles,"US lawmakers have introduced legislation that would force carmakers to maintain AM radio compatibility in all new cars at no additional charge to listeners.Read moreA look back at BTS as it became the world's top-selling actYour anxiety brings 4 distinct superpowersAmericans may have seen the last of big rent hikesAccording to Markey, the loss of AM access infringes on consumer rights and makes it more difficult for the government to reach citizens in the event of a national emergency.Most of the car models that no longer include AM radio are electric vehicles (EV), a decision automakers have blamed on electromagnetic interference caused by the electric drivetrains in battery-powered engines.EV batteries produce the same frequencies as AM radios, leading to the two signals canceling each other out. This can cause poor audio quality and lots of static.However, putting effective AM radios in electric vehicles is certainly possible. For example, companies like Hyundai and Jeep have kept AM radios by using shielded cables and connectors that cut down on frequency interference.Markey acknowledged this limitation while expressing his support for the transition to EVs.In addition to the technical limitations of EVs, most car companies simply point to the proliferation of internet and satellite-connected radios in cars as an innovative, high-tech replacement for AM radio. But is internet radio really better?

TSLA,"Tesla would be 'lucky' to keep Cybertruck price at $75,000, MotorTrend CEO says","New data from MotorTrend finds that electric vehicles are hot on their users’ buying lists. And one upcoming EV pickup truck could be the most polarizing.The motor magazine, TV network, and car-shopping site found that in the past year, 78% of active car shoppers are “very interested” in EVs at the moment, and that over the next five years nearly 50% of car shoppers say they will definitely or probably buy an electric or hybrid vehicle.“All of us, even the people who are watching right now are saying to themselves, ‘I know I'm going to get an EV, is it the right time?,” said Alex Wellen, president and CEO of the MotorTrend group in an interview with Yahoo Finance. “‘I don't know about the range anxiety, I don't know about how I'm going to charge it, is it affordable?,’ but everyone knows that they're going to be inside of an EV soon.”The inevitability of EVs in the car buyer’s mind seems to be growing by the day. And with the passage of the federal tax credit for EVs, and new models introduced every day, the pull to buy EVs is becoming more powerful. However, pricing may be an issue as the average cost for one soars to $55,000 on average.That being said, when drilling down over the data the most popular EV models on MotorTrend’s Buyer’s guide starts with, not surprisingly, the Tesla Model 3, followed by the Ford Mustang Mach-E, Chevy Bolt EV, Tesla Model Y, and Lucid Air.But what’s more surprising is that the most popular EV (and and vehicle overall) brand searched on MotorTrend.com over the past year is Rivian, which had 22% more search volume than Tesla, and 67% more than Lucid.While the Rivian R1T pickup was named MotorTrend’s 2022 Truck of the Year, its relatively low sales volume, long waitlist, and high price make it a surprising top search term. But its capabilities, such as having four electric motors, 900 hp, and all-terrain abilities may have drawn curious EV shoppers in.Speaking of electric pickups — the one that’s getting the most heat recently is the Tesla Cybertruck, due for production later this year. MotorTrend users are definitely interested in it, but not without caveats.“From a design point of view it's very polarizing, and I think a lot of people just won't simply want it,” Wellen said, though he believes CEO Elon Musk has done a nice job of surprising doubters in the past, and should be close to as capable as the Rivian R1T.But pricing will be key — and it’s here where the Cybertruck will have to thread the needle in a competitive space that also counts the Ford F-150 Lightning and soon the Chevrolet Silverado EV and Ram 1500 REV EV.“Musk said in 2019, three and a half years ago that [the Cybertruck] would be $39,000 - I think eventually, like they did with the Model 3, they'll have a $39,000 truck,” Wellen said, but not right away. “But if they want to do three or four motors, I would say they would be lucky at $75,000.”With the dual-motor Rivian R1T starting around that price, it will be an interesting landscape if Tesla is able to make the Cybertruck and its tri-motor setup at $75,000.One thing is likely for sure, when the Cybertruck is finally out and available for sale, it just might become the most popular search term on the MotorTrend.com website — because of its fans as well as its haters.—Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance","May 18, 2023 at 12:58 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-would-be-lucky-to-keep-cybertruck-price-at-75000-motortrend-ceo-says-175857935.html,Yahoo Finance,0.3333333333333333,0.8333333333333334,0.21621436850945047,0.5219861377238426,2023-05-18 12:58:00,2023-05-18 12:58:00,174.22000122070312,176.88999938964844,-2.6699981689453125

TSLA,"EVs: Tesla Cybertruck 'would be lucky' to keep price at $75,000, MotorTrend CEO says","MotorTrend Group CEO and President Alex Wellen joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss why people are interested in EVs, the most popular EVs, the Tesla Cybertruck, and EV price points.And then within the next five years, we predict that about 50% will definitely or very likely be inside an EV. All of us, all the people who are watching right now are saying to themselves, all right, I know I'm going to get an EV. Is it the right time? I don't know about the range anxiety. I don't know about how I'm going to charge it. Is it affordable? But everyone knows that they're going to be inside of an EV soon.Many of these trucks are one or two motors to be able to do what they need to do that workload and how much battery you need. But four motors, you feel it immediately. I think they've done a great job with the regenerative brake. So that's that feeling of being able to really one pedal a car. I'm so used to three pedals in a manual. I don't know if any of you have driven manual. But now you're down to one pedal.So I don't think they're going to lose that market share. But I think the Cybertruck, you know, Musk has done a nice job of surprising us. He said it would have three motors. And Rivian comes along with four motors. I'm sure they'll have four motors. And that truck is a lightning rod. But I think they will do well with it. They're doing extremely well with the semi trucks. So I would never count Musk out in that way. But I agree, maybe it doesn't suit you. Are you more of a Ford F-150 or--I think eventually, like they did with the Model 3, they'll have a $39,000 truck. But initially, if they want to do three or four motors, I would say they would be lucky at $75,000. I think you'll probably be in that range. And the way they'll say it is, hey, I know we talked about that $39,000 truck. It's coming. But if you want the fully-loaded four motors, it's going to cost you $80,000. That's my guess.But then on the other side, in addition to live events that we do and social, we have all these tools, these research tools and these buyers guide tools and this research that we're doing to help put people inside of cars. As far as the landscape is concerned, I think it's always a question of business about why do you go and how deep do you go?I think for someone like us, I think there will be this moment coming where going deep is really important for fans, right? So all you can eat is really critical if you have great brands like Warner Brothers Discovery, like these extraordinary brands like DC and Harry Potter. But for someone like us like MotorTrend, and we own Hot Rod and Super Street and all these other brands, we want to go deeper.Like if I were to ask the three of you, what are the two or three cars that define you, like that your parents had that, you had first of all, that you saw in a film? Like I would know so much about you. You would have an instant connection. I feel like that's what we need to do with our fans. Understand the cars that matter most to them. And so yeah, I think the more we can do to help get them in the car and be generous, the more we can do to celebrate car culture.

TSLA,"Tesla held talks with India on auto incentives, battery making: source","By Aditi Shah, Aditya Kalra and Munsif VengattilNEW DELHI (Reuters) -Tesla Inc has held discussions with officials about incentives being offered by India for car and battery manufacturing, said a person with direct knowledge of the talks, as the automaker looks anew at entering the Indian market.The U.S. electric car maker has proposed setting up a factory in India to build electric vehicles (EVs), Reuters reported on Wednesday. Plans to locally manufacture EV batteries are also being discussed, said the person with direct knowledge.Tesla is ""still testing the waters and trying to understand the local policies,"" said the person, who declined to be named as the talks were private.During the visit, details of which have not been publicly disclosed by the company or any Indian ministry, Tesla on Thursday met India's deputy IT minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar, one of the highest-ranking officials the company held talks with, said a source in the Indian government.Tesla and India's IT ministry did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.Tesla's delegation included Karn Budhiraj, a senior supply chain executive based in the United States, the two sources said.The discussions in India represent a shift in stance for the U.S. electric car maker.Late last year it was focused on seeking lower import taxes on cars, which can be as much as 100%, and talks with the Indian government became deadlocked. India is keen for Tesla to build vehicles locally but the company argued it wanted to export first so that it could test the strength of demand.Recent talks have touched on India's taxes on imported cars but have mainly centred on how Tesla could make use of a government scheme, the first source said.India has set aside around $6 billion under two programs to boost EV sales and manufacturing. Under the schemes, automakers and battery manufacturers can get certain cashback incentives for selling and exporting locally made vehicles and parts.""It appears Tesla has come with a different heart and head this time to take advantage of the auto boom (in India) ... Tesla can negotiate on things like taxes better if it first sets up a plant,"" said Mohan Shukla of New Delhi-based public policy advisory White Dolphin Media.Tesla has described a goal of selling 20 million EVs a year in 2030, a level that would require massive new investment in assembly plants and battery production.Outside the United States, Tesla has a plant in Shanghai - its largest factory worldwide - and one in Brandenburg, Germany.In addition to India, Tesla has been in talks over the past year with officials in Indonesia and South Korea about potential investments.India is the world's third-largest automobile market. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's administration has set an ambitious target of having EVs account for 30% of India's total car sales by 2030 from around 1% today.Tesla's talks with India come at a crucial time for Modi, who is looking to attract investments in the run-up to national elections next year where he will be seeking a rare third term.(Reporting by Aditi Shah and Aditya KalraEditing by Edwina Gibbs, Jason Neely and Mark Potter)","May 18, 2023 at 1:25 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-discussed-incentive-scheme-auto-062535683.html,Reuters,0.0,0.0,0.08978205702343632,0.3711673384087177,2023-05-18 01:25:00,2023-05-18 01:25:00,174.22000122070312,176.88999938964844,-2.6699981689453125

TSLA,Analysis-Elon Musk's embrace of advertising at Tesla grabs marketers' attention,"By Akash Sriram and Hyunjoo Jin(Reuters) - With Elon Musk outlining plans for Tesla Inc to use traditional advertising for the first time, viewers might see the electric-vehicle maker's Model Y crossover or upcoming Cybertruck pickup - maybe even the billionaire CEO himself - on TV or online.Musk revealed those plans on Tuesday at the company's annual meeting, an about-face for the celebrity executive who recently acquired social media platform Twitter. He has for years eschewed advertising in favor of seeking to capitalize on his star power and customer enthusiasm for Tesla's vehicles.""We'll try out a little advertising and see how it goes,"" he told investors in Austin, Texas.Tesla shares closed 4.4% higher on Wednesday.Musk said Tesla is not immune to macroeconomic pressures he foresees over the next year. The EV maker's tweaking of prices in its major markets is a symptom of a company that no longer can take ever-higher levels of demand for granted in the face of growing competition.Whatever advertising path Musk chooses, ad agency executives and investors expect a unique and irreverent take that will clearly communicate Tesla's advantages, including its technology.""Tesla has not been like every other car company, and he's not going to start now, so expect breakthrough creative that speaks to Tesla's disruptive technology and personality,"" said Tal Jacobson, incoming CEO at advertising technology company Perion Network.""His ability to use the media to amplify his brand and his company's brands is an art form,"" Jacobson said of Musk.Musk, who could not be reached for comment, told CNBC on Tuesday that he envisioned advertising that emphasized the features, safety and affordability of Tesla vehicles. A Tesla spokesperson declined to add anything beyond Musk's comments.Musk told CNBC he did not yet have a ""fully formed strategy"" for Tesla advertising. He said it should be ""informative about a product"" and ""aesthetically pleasing."" He added: ""It should have some artistic element to it. And it should be something that you don't regret watching after it's done.""While Tesla disseminates information about its vehicles via its Twitter account, Musk told CNBC that approach is ""preaching to the converted and not reaching people that are not already convinced.""Last year, Musk touted the company's ""$1 (trillion) valuation with $0 advertising spend"" on Twitter.FUTURISTIC ADS?Some industry officials mused on whether Musk might attempt a memorable TV ad, perhaps akin to the famous ""1984"" commercial for Apple Inc's Macintosh computer which was directed by Ridley Scott and aired only during the Super Bowl. Many say that commercial, inspired by George Orwell's dystopian novel of the same name, paved the way for big-budget TV commercials.""I don't think Musk would spend elaborately on a brand mosaic like Apple did, but ... minimalistic while futuristic is the approach I'd see him taking,"" said Bob Gruters, chief revenue officer at streaming platform Loop Media.Some wonder whether Musk may feature himself in the ads, although that may carry risk as the executive can be polarizing.""Is he an effective ambassador? My guess is that there is a less polarizing, more motivating and compelling way to communicate the brand's benefits than using Musk as a spokesperson,"" said Kimberly Whitler, a professor at the University of Virginia's business school.While Musk did not outline a marketing budget, Tesla would likely be perceived as a high-profile account for top advertising companies, said Vivek Astvansh, assistant professor of advertising at Indiana University's business school.Officials with four of the world's top ad-buying firms - WPP, Omnicom Group, Publicis Groupe and Dentsu Group - could not immediately be reached for comment.Tesla spent $151,947 on advertising in the U.S. in 2022, according to advertising intelligence firm Vivvix, which measured ads across places including TV, social media, Web banners and billboards. By comparison, Ford and Toyota Motor Corp spent $370 million and $1.1 billion, respectively, while the brands of General Motors Co collectively spent a total of $1.35 billion on U.S. ads last year, Vivvix data showed.GM last year spent $4 billion globally on advertising and promotions, while Ford Motor Co spent $2.2 billion on advertising, according to U.S. regulatory filings.TWITTER CONNECTIONMusk's ""newfound passion for advertising,"" in the words of author and venture capitalist Claire Diaz-Ortiz, was not surprising given his takeover of Twitter last fall, she said. Diaz-Ortiz is a former Twitter manager who has written books about the social media company.Last week, Musk named former NBCUniversal ad chief Linda Yaccarino as Twitter's new CEO.""It is hard for Musk to own a social media company that requires advertising dollars to survive and then to dismiss, as head of a manufacturing company, the value of advertising,"" University of Virginia's Whitler said.Thomas Martin, senior portfolio manager at Tesla shareholder Globalt Investments, sees Musk's embrace of advertising as a positive. He expects the company to show how its products differ from its competitors'. ""Obviously they're going to have to focus on what's good for the environment and also that it is a car of the future as opposed to your father's Oldsmobile,"" he said.(Reporting Hyunjoo Jin in San Francisco and Akash Sriram in Bengaluru, Additional reporting by Yuvraj Malik and Aditya Soni in Bengaluru, Sheila Dang in Dallas and Victoria Waldersee in Berlin; Writing by by Ben Klayman; Editing by Matthew Lewis)","May 17, 2023 at 4:38 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysis-elon-musks-embrace-advertising-213802343.html,Reuters,0.0,0.0,0.11431556948798328,0.4086206896551725,2023-05-17 16:38:00,2023-05-17 16:38:00,168.41000366210938,173.86000061035156,-5.4499969482421875

TSLA,Chipotle 'pivoted just the right way' into digital during the pandemic: Analyst,"Laffer Tengler Investments CEO and CIO Nancy Tengler joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss stocks to buy, including Starbucks, Chipotle, and Tesla, and stocks to avoid, including Disney and CVS.Nancy, it's great to have you here. So you have some stocks for us to buy, some stocks that you're advising to hold-- to avoid at this point. Let's start with one of your buys, Starbucks. What do you like about it?And we just felt like it was something we'd owned for a very long time. So we got out and pretty much went straight up from there. And so we waited until Laxman, who's the new CEO, reported earnings and gave muted guidance and so the stock sold off.And I just think he did that because that would be a smart thing to do as the new CEO-- not raise guidance precipitously, just wait and then surprise to the upside. So they've got a lot of levers to pull. The labor thing seems to be OK. China's reopened, strong dividend growth. So we stepped back in and we'll continue to add on volatility.They are in three disparate businesses. One seems to be working at all times. But they're not getting credit for that. So great company, but not a great stock.And then the last thing I'll say is you're not even getting paid to wait, because the dividend was suspended and there's no talk of even adding it back in. So we're on the sidelines.So it has a pretty, I'd say, a full valuation. We were buying it during the pandemic, so our acquisition cost was about $500. But it's just-- it's a growth stock that's always had a lofty valuation. They've got pricing power and excellent management.Consumers still coming along, they are still coming through the stores even at a higher price point.And you could make the same argument about Starbucks. How much are you going to pay-- how much are you going to be willing to pay for that iced latte? I mean, mine the other day was $7.25. And I bought it.So I think that's some of it. Now, that doesn't mean growth isn't going to slow if the consumer gets softer. But eating out, and at that price point, I mean, I'd actually rather pay that much for a burrito than I would for a cup of coffee. So I think they just have a lot of the right elements. And it's clean food, people perceive. And it's good.And we started buying the stock in 2012 because we liked the services ecosystem story. I think Tesla has the same thing going on and people are overlooking that. I mean, for example, they have a $300 million insurance premium business that no one talks about. So the ecosystem-- they're cutting pricing to draw people into the ecosystem, and that has sustainable earnings growth power in the future.I also think it's kind of interesting that people are bemoaning the decline in their margins. It's still four times or five times Ford's, and they forced Ford to cut EV prices twice this year. So I think him sort of experimenting with advertising-- I don't think that's a sign of weakness. I just think it's smart business.So we felt like at that point, it was kind of gambling for our clients, because there was no management succession. Now, he's got one of the best CFOs in the country, I think. And he has hired, like, as everyone requested, he has hired a woman to take over the company, Twitter, that is.And so for us, it just feels like he's marching at his own pace, as he always does. But I don't think the distraction factor is the same with him as it might be with other CEOs. And so we were beneficiaries of people selling the stock, and he selling the stock at the end of last year, because we picked it up in early January in the low 100s. So we're pretty happy with our investments so far.","May 17, 2023 at 3:50 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/chipotle-pivoted-just-way-digital-205049689.html,Yahoo Finance Video,0.14285714285714285,0.26785714285714285,0.1799687812187812,0.5296574259074258,2023-05-17 15:50:00,2023-05-17 15:50:00,168.41000366210938,173.86000061035156,-5.4499969482421875
TSLA,"Tesla will be 'the best AI play of the next decade', analyst explains","Kevin Paffrath, Financial Analyst and ""Meet Kevin"" YouTube Host, joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss Tesla's shareholder meeting, Tesla advertising, how Tesla's AI integration will impact the company's profitability, and the Tesla Cybertruck.Kevin, good to talk to you today. You know, it's interesting the way that Elon musk kind of framed this, saying look, I wasn't into advertising until I bought a company that was highly reliant on ads. But the fact that Tesla is now giving this a second look, does that point to some of the challenges they're seeing in the market as it gets more and more crowded, and we start to see more price cuts?Tesla is the largest position in my ETF, so when I was at the shareholder meeting yesterday I'm like, ""Come on, Elon!"" I'm trying to grab him by the shoulders and shake him. You can't just keep cutting prices, because if you cut prices of the vehicles, the reality is mainstream folks don't necessarily know about these new prices, and so, you have to advertise. And this analogy that I made at the shareholder meeting was that if-- they dropped the price of a vehicle $7,000-- if instead they dropped the price maybe $6,500, took $500 and threw it into advertising for every vehicle they produced, that'd be nearly half of Netflix's annual advertising budget of about $1 billion. If they just took $1,000 instead of doing price cuts and did ads, now they can talk about the features with the amount of money that Netflix spends on advertising.So simply put, they can spend billions of dollars in advertising with a very little portion of pricing remaining in the vehicles. And now we can talk about how Elon will take a five-year-old car and provide it software updates to make the airbags safer, the restraint system safer, to make the braking system safer. These cars are becoming more valuable over time rather than less like most cars, but nobody knows. Nobody knows the pricing of them, these updates, these features these cars get. And people think it's a luxury or very expensive vehicle, when people don't realize you could buy a Model 3 right now for 36,000 bucks after a tax credit and get all of these features.So taking a small bit of money in advertising would be a huge game-changer for Tesla.So I don't know that we're ready to make a new bottom, but I also don't know that we're ready to break any kind of new highs anytime soon. So Elon's probably right with his warning, wait the next 12 months.The beautiful thing though about Tesla is, in my opinion, now you have an extended opportunity to increase your exposure to it. And I think it's actually the best and most overlooked AI play that exists. Everybody's looking for AI stocks and they're looking at companies like Google. And Google, by creating AI or integrating AI, is putting at risk 69% of all of their advertising revenue. So while they might gain some revenue in integrating AI, they're losing elsewhere. Where when you look at Tesla, the more they integrate AI the more profitable they become.This is a company that could actually make a substantial amount of pure profit from artificial intelligence. Elon himself suggests that their margins could be zero on the car and 100% from artificial intelligence. We don't even have to consider robotaxis or the Optimus robot in the future. Just the full self-driving features itself, with people sitting in the vehicle, those margins could make this an extremely profitable company, more so than it already is. Yet now people are scrambling thinking, ""I'm going to invest in Microsoft or Google or Facebook because they mention AI."" It's ludicrous. Tesla is the best AI play of the next decade, followed by the chip companies. The danger of course is the chip companies become commodities, where Tesla maintains true pricing power.I'm curious to hear your take on the Cybertruck. Elon Musk has said look, we want to start production by the end of the year. The numbers he put out, though, 250000 to 500000 units a year, that he thinks Tesla can deliver on, it appears to be a little more of a conservative estimate. Is that realistic, do you think?And I think the ramp for this vehicle is going to be very extended. That's because we're building the vehicle completely differently. We're building it from the outside in rather than the inside out. In other words, there isn't a traditional steel frame inside the car. The outside of the car is the frame. It's a totally different way of manufacturing.So I think a lot of patients should be kept sort of in mind for the Cybertruck, and I really wouldn't start trying to model out the Cybertruck as being even that ambitious of a target probably until 2025. I wouldn't be expecting a Roadster until 2030 or beyond.So I think patience will be very important for Tesla, but as an AI play, I think people who realize that AI potential and eventually these new products are going to be very well rewarded.I do think that Elon can walk away and let the auto division run. But what Ellen's useful for is actually the next level, that AI, integrating the Optimus and getting to the next level of AI in full self-driving. That's where he is key. I think he can tie this vision together and guide the engineers in the right places to make sure we get what's practical and functional, in his words, quote-unquote, ""for humanity.""And so I think he is mission-critical for that. For just the car company, he could walk away from that and I think Tesla would be just fine. But hearing that he's staying, absolute win, again, for the AI play.Now, they just need to advertise it. And I think they should hire Ryan Reynolds. His ads for Mint Mobile, that's the person we need pitching this.

TSLA,Competing the the Tesla Semi: Kodiak Robotics To Roll Out Sleek New Autonomous Big Rig,"The company’s Class 8 Peterbilt truck implementation will conquer new roads in 2024. It comes as California — a key market for Kodiak Robotics — recently banned diesel heavy-duty trucks by 2036, a move driving innovation and electrification. This shift toward electrified vehicles creates an opportunity for first-movers like Kodiak Robotics, especially because the firm offers a vehicle-agnostic autonomous system that’s easily paired with any manufacturer.Kodiak’s vehicle are ideal for short-haul trips because of the range limitations for heavy electrified trucks that make them currently unsuitable for long-haul distances. Providers like Kodiak Robotics predict considerable improvements in range, similar to the strides seen with consumer electric vehicles' range and performance features. Kodiak Robotics notes there is a significant demand for electrified autonomous vehicles for shorter-range jobs, and demand will grow hand-in-hand with expanded range.Trucking firms stand to gain immensely from autonomous truck adoption, as wages and benefits are a considerable cost they can scale down or eliminate. Human drivers possess skill and intuition but also face restrictions on their operating hours and too often drive on limited rest, putting themselves and others at risk.The Kodiak Robotics truck boasts several core capabilities that are essential for any autonomous trucking firm that hopes to get its vehicles out on the road:Powerful light detection and ranging (Lidar) and radar along with short and long-range cameras can sense objects and provide the vehicle’s computer with distance and proximity information about the various objects.Precise driving controls manage the throttle and brakes in response to real-time driving conditions.Intelligent machine learning helps the truck plan a route for optimum efficiency and safety.Multiple redundancies keep the truck working in the event of a failure and the usage of aerospace-grade materials ensures high reliability.In California, state legislators are debating a bill that would require a human controller to remain in any autonomous vehicle weighing more than 10,000 pounds. Industry firms will need to establish safety standards and demonstrate the benefits of autonomous drivers to overcome restrictions and ease the public’s hesitation. It is currently illegal to test or deploy autonomous vehicles in California.Another roadblock for trucking companies is city driving. Compared to long-haul highway trips, navigating a semitruck in a city is challenging. An autonomous vehicle winding through a city to a delivery destination needs to sense and navigate through pedestrians, spot and use caution around construction workers and maneuver through tight spaces filled with cyclists and other vehicles. There is also limited charging infrastructure for long-distance electrified freight vehicles. 4 Technologies That Aren't That Big Today but Will Likely Be Massive in 20 YearsBlockchain Revolutionizing Video Game Transactions, Marc Andreessen Among Billionaires Funding Leading Gaming Startups .© 2023 Benzinga.com.

We got earnings out from Target as well as TJX, the parent company of TJ Maxx as well as HomeGoods. Now, the results out from Target were not quite a bull's eye, but this does come at a time as consumers are being careful about where they spend their hard earned dollars. We saw that Target's profit decline by 5.8% in the latest quarter. And total sales did rise by about half a percent and digital sales declined as shoppers cut back on their discretionary spending. Now, in terms of share prices this morning we are seeing both target and TJX higher.Now in terms of the details out from TJX earnings results it did raise its annual profit forecast. And it is setting a lower cost as well as demand from price conscious consumers. TJX is seeing expenses come down and the company is now expecting its 2024 adjusted profit to come in above its previous range. It has also maintained its full year sales forecast. Looking ahead, we will be getting retail earnings out from big names, including Walmart as well as Lowe's.And last but not least, very quickly taking a look at Tesla shares, they are higher this morning. Now, Elon Musk did forecast a challenging year ahead for the carmaker due to higher interest rates affecting purchases by consumers. The CEO of Tesla did say that two new Tesla models were coming. And also, most interestingly, Musk told companies shareholders that the company will advertise for the first time in history.","May 17, 2023 at 10:50 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/markets-rise-amid-debt-ceiling-155041642.html,Yahoo Finance Video,0.25,0.5,0.13656565656565656,0.44973737373737377,2023-05-17 10:50:00,2023-05-17 10:50:00,168.41000366210938,173.86000061035156,-5.4499969482421875

TSLA,Tesla Reverses Course While Traditional Automakers Continue Accelerating Their EV Efforts,"During its annual meeting in Austin Texas, Musk revealed that Tesla will be trying a little advertising after all. This decision is quite a turnaround as its CEO Elon Musk was saying for years that there is no need for advertising as demand exceeded supply, adding that those funds are being used to make Tesla’s product great.After receiving a positive reaction, Musk also warned of tough economic times that he expects to be around for at least the following 12 months, saying Tesla is not immune to a worsening economy. Musk also stated that Tesla Roadster which was due for production in deliveries back in 2020 is expected to get on the production line in 2024, while its competition Rivian R1T, Ford F-150 Lightning and Ford Mustang Mach-E have already hit the road. Putting aside the fact that Ford is known for producing America’s most beloved pickup, Tesla has no time to waste. Ford also stated that it will be doubling the production of Lightning’s older all-electric sibling, the Mustang Mach-E, this year.Worksport will soon be providing an update regarding the production launch of its improved COR advanced hot-swap battery system. After testing and completion, Worksport will be able to produce its eagerly anticipated SOLIS solar-powered tonneau covers.Considering that even Tesla decided to change its strategy that seemed to be ‘written in stone’, it’s safe to say that anything can happen as automakers accelerate their progress towards realizing an all-electric future..© 2023 Benzinga.com.

Everybody criticized this guy for a million different reasons. But at the end of the day, when you ask somebody if you want to buy an EV, what do they want? They want a Tesla. So GM hasn't come with anything anybody wants. Porsche hasn't done it yet. I'm not saying they won't. But it hasn't happened yet.Meanwhile, they gained share. They reduced price. They're getting more aggressive. They're bringing the truck. I don't see a bad story here. And it's reflected in the stock, although it's a volatile stock. But if he's saying there's headwinds economically globally, that's the same environment for every company, whether they're in the EV market or not.What they've got that no one else has is a 100% focus on EV. They're not dealing with legacy engines of any kind. And so you have a much more efficient use and a much more productive company.Now, this issue around four wheel versus two wheel, if it comes with a two wheel first, there will still be demand for it because the truth is most people don't drive these trucks off road. But if you wanted to drive that thing off road, you could. I like it. And I think-- you know, I'm on the list to get one.The electric vehicle of that version has not yet enticed me to switch over yet because of battery concerns, about concerns in cold weather, all kinds of other things. The one thing I really like about the story that I learned yesterday on the whole Elon thing, the margins on this truck could be really high. I mean, this is going to be-- because they've had so much efficiency in manufacturing costs since they announced the truck. They're probably picking up, you know, 10% to 12% more margin on that thing.Look, he gets himself in a lot of trouble. That must be a big time distraction. All the litigation and all the stuff that he has to deal with by just a nonstop barrage of communications that are sometimes off side. But on the other hand, he is who he is.So he goes on. But at the end of the day, it comes back to this broader discussion about who is still able to work from home. And he called some of them the laptop elites or the laptop class, if you will. We've continued to have this debate about where work from home still has a larger place in the workforce or employment situation society here. Do you agree with what Elon said? Do you believe that there's another way that this can have a balance in the employment future?And what we've learned-- and I invest in all 11 sectors. Here's what I've learned postpandemic. Let me give you financial services, for example. I have investments in many financial services companies. A 40% of the staff approximately are never coming back to the office. And if you think you can force them back, they'll just go work for somebody else.And so people in compliance, in logistics, in accounting that used to live in cubicles, in the basement, don't want to do that anymore. They found different lifestyles, sometimes hundreds or thousands of miles away from HQ. And when you now know that 40% don't have to be there, because they've got lots of successful companies that have 40% of people working remotely, you can move your headquarters.You can move it out of San Francisco, move it out of New York, move it out of Massachusetts. These are uninvestable states. They have terrible tax and regulatory environments. Move them to North Dakota. Move them to South Dakota, Montana, Oklahoma. Tax is way more competitive, regulatory environment better. And we have done that.And I'll give you the challenge that Elon Musk has in his own universe. You can't apply forcing everybody back to work in San Francisco, where Twitter is headquartered. San Francisco is a war zone. It is perhaps the most mismanaged city in the United States in the most mismanaged state in the United States. You walk out at night, you risk your life there. You get executed. Why would you force somebody to work in a war zone when they could work, particularly on a product like Twitter, anywhere?He will have a very hard time keeping the best and brightest in Twitter saying you've got to come and go through the war zone every day. If you get shot at, that's not my problem. Do you have a military vest on? Do you have a helmet? Do you have a tank? How are you going to get to work? You leave after sunset, you die. Who would want that?San Francisco is uninvestable and unlivable now. And it's not just me saying that. Look at all the retailers pulling out. The shrinkage is like 10% downtown. People steal stuff. And they know there's nobody going to stop them from doing it. And if you do try and stop them, they shoot you. Well, they've got a lot of work to fix that up on. And that's why working for remote for cities where they're war zones, San Francisco is not the only one. Look at Los Angeles. It's a mess.Poorly managed changes people's perception. There are thousands of people moving out of New York for tax reasons and safety. 3,000 license plates a month to Florida and Miami region alone.And it's never going to get full again. They're going to have to recapitalize or reconstitute or repurpose those buildings. And that's going to require a lot of capital. The problem is, why put that capital in a city that is so uncompetitive in the business regulatory and tax environment? Move it out of New York. That's the whole idea.And I think-- I'm not the only person saying this. I would never invest a dime in New York City. It's got the worst tax policy and regulatory environment. AOC wants to sue you if you try and create jobs here. Look, don't shoot the messenger. These are facts.But what I'm more worried about is that there is no capital available for businesses from 5 to 500 employees anymore. People talk about slowdown on lending. Let me assure you there is no lending. And that's because of the Silicon Valley Bank collapse and the other two banks. The smaller banks have stopped lending money.","May 17, 2023 at 9:56 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/kevin-oleary-talks-tesla-cybertruck-145633790.html,Yahoo Finance Video,0.1,0.15000000000000002,0.11179063360881547,0.4301744719926537,2023-05-17 09:56:00,2023-05-17 09:56:00,168.41000366210938,173.86000061035156,-5.4499969482421875

TSLA,Tesla Cybertruck is 'one of the most misunderstood' releases from EV maker: Analyst,"Tasha Keeney, ARK Invest Director of Investment Analysis & Institutional Strategies, joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss the performance of Tesla shares, Tesla's delivery of Cybertrucks, and key takeaways from Tesla CEO Elon Musk's speech at Tesla's 2023 shareholders meeting.I do think there's something to this strategy, where the research that we've done at ARK Invest suggests that thanks to rights law, battery costs have declined at such a rate that already the total cost of ownership of an electric vehicle is cheaper than its gas-powered equivalent. Now sticker prices are also becoming cheaper. Tesla's actually cheaper than the average car in the US.So this kind of suggests that the incremental person that is not buying an electric vehicle maybe just hasn't been reached by messaging and, you know, needs to sort of be informed of all the benefits. So I don't think that advertising is a bad idea.I do think that what didn't get enough focus after the event is this focus on autonomy. I feel like there's a lot of doubt that Tesla can create a fully autonomous car. But, you know, the research that we've done suggests that, as Elon Musk said, this will be the greatest asset unlock in history. We think this will be over 2/3 of the enterprise value of the company in the next five years, because this is so, so valuable. And really, it's becoming possible in the next year or so.But if you're paying close attention and you've watched the updates that they've made to the full self-driving beta program-- and actually, anecdotally, the user videos that have been generated online show people in San Francisco using a Tesla for a ride-hail ride, an actual Uber ride on their phone. And they essentially don't touch the wheel at all during the drive. At the very beginning and the very end, they do.But, you know, so I think that we have evidence already that it's basically possible now in select areas, right? It's not perfect. Other-- other items that give us increased confidence are, one, just, you know, the plethora of AI progress that we've seen over the past year or so, from large language models like ChatGPT to diffusion models. So we already know that Tesla has incorporated, for instance, transformers, which were popularized by large language models. So I think that this overall progress in AI gives us confidence for the autonomous driving industry as a whole.Now, what makes Tesla so special? Well, Tesla has a different approach to full autonomy than the rest of the players, than Cruise and Waymo. They're going after, you know, this nationwide, possible everywhere approach, as opposed to using high-definition maps and doing a geofenced rollout in select cities.The reason that they can do this is because they have an unmatched data advantage. So Tesla vehicles travel over 100 million miles a day. We know that in FSD Beta alone, they have cumulative miles of about 200 million so far driven. You know, if you compare that to Cruise and Waymo, which isn't quite apples to apples, I'll note, but what we have from them is that Cruise and Waymo have both passed roughly a million miles driven fully autonomously.So, you know, they have orders of magnitude more information about how to solve this problem. And that's what really gives us confidence in their strategy.So I would say overall, you know, the comparison is, what are the traditional automakers doing? And Tesla has much more scale than traditional autos.So, you know, we think that this vehicle will sell much more than people expect.So I actually disagree that this will be a car that won't sell that many units. I think that this could-- you know, that this could be rivaling any other truck out there, certainly in terms of performance, right, because again, a Tesla on a dollar-per-performance basis for batteries has, you know, a better metric than any other automaker that's out there. And we know that because of ARK's research.So I think if you look at this versus, for instance, the Ford F-150 electric version, this is a much more attractive car. And I think consumers will realize that. You know, and by the way, I also think they'll use this design on the robotaxi because it is so cost effective. And again, I think it'll be much more popular than people expect.And again, I just don't think the vehicle is getting enough attention for the genius cost dynamics here, especially when people are commenting that they're worried about demand, price action for electric vehicles. You know, this is a car that allows Tesla to get great margins and to be able to charge attractive prices compared to the competition.And with dealers, you actually have to educate them on electric vehicles. And we've seen issues with this in the past, particularly for companies like GM, where the dealers themselves are actually misunderstanding how electric vehicles work. And they're actually including that in the advertising. So I think that's actually a huge advantage for Tesla.In terms of what time frame you should look at this is a success, this is an innovation story. At ARK Invest, we have a five-year investment time horizon. So I think it should be looked at over a long year-- over a five-year time period. But I'll say with that, again, I think there's far too much focus on this vehicle, the demand for the vehicle. There's not enough focus on autonomy, because when you're talking about five years, you know, the midpoint of our estimates is that by 2024, Tesla could release a fully autonomous taxi network.It'll compete with Uber. It'll be able to undercut today's ride hail price-- today's ride hail rides on price. And I think it'll be wildly successful. It'll bring recurring revenue streams and very attractive margins to Tesla, unlike what we've seen in the traditional vehicle business. So I would say that is what to watch-- you should watch out for over that time period.","May 17, 2023 at 9:43 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/tesla-cybertruck-one-most-misunderstood-144308106.html,Yahoo Finance Video,0.5,0.5,0.1953057359307359,0.5315178571428574,2023-05-17 09:43:00,2023-05-17 09:43:00,168.41000366210938,173.86000061035156,-5.4499969482421875

TSLA,Elon Musk promises Cybertruck deliveries by the end of 2023 at Tesla shareholders meeting,"Yahoo Finance Live's Julie Hyman discusses the top takeaways from Tesla's 2023 shareholder meeting including Tesla CEO Elon Musk's promise to deliver Cybertrucks this year.One, Elon Musk is renewing his vows to Tesla, dispelling rumors that he's going to leave the company, saying he is indeed staying on as CEO. And this comes, remember, after Musk welcomed a new Twitter CEO, NBCU's former advertising chief Linda Yaccarino.

TSLA,"Target earnings, debt ceiling debate, Tesla's ads: Three things to know this morning","The Yahoo Finance Live team breaks down three top trending headlines; Target's Q1 earnings, the debt ceiling dilemma, and Elon Musk addressing investors at the Tesla annual shareholders meeting.Thing number one, Target numbers last quarter hit the mark, but earnings this quarter will miss the bullseye. Comparable sales almost flatlined in Q1, while digital sales slumped by 3.4% from a year ago. A growing issue for Target and other retailers, in-store theft, which Target CEO Brian Cornell said could trim profit this year by $500 million. Still, the company did leave its full-year earnings forecast unchanged.And there is a pattern emerging from some of these early retailers that consumers are being more selective in their purchases, avoiding bigger-ticket items. It follows on what we saw with Home Depot's report yesterday.Thing number two, debt-ceiling negotiations are inching forward even as the threat of default continues to hang over the market, particularly and increasingly the bond market. The debt-ceiling impasse continues to act as a sword of Damocles hanging over the market. President Joe Biden and Kevin McCarthy have appointed high-level representatives to try to push talks forward and wrangle over details. The president nixed a visit to Australia and Papua New Guinea that was to follow his trip to Japan to the Group of Seven meeting in order to return to Washington to continue negotiating.Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, of course, has been warning over the issue on what seems like a daily basis. She says a default could trigger recession.And thing number three, the world's richest man making a series of headlines overnight. We're talking about Elon Musk, of course, addressing shareholders, first at Tesla's annual shareholder meeting in Austin, Texas. Among the highlights, he announced the delivery of the much anticipated Cybertruck. He says that will begin this year, adding he'll be driving one himself.His tone on the economy was downbeat, but he said Tesla was well positioned, and he said the Model Y will become the best-selling car on the planet. Musk also hinting that Tesla might rethink its stance on advertising. That would be a big shift.In a separate interview with CNBC, Musk touched on monetary policy, defended his tweeting, and slammed work-from-home culture.","May 17, 2023 at 8:23 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/target-earnings-debt-ceiling-debate-132304804.html,Yahoo Finance Video,0.0,0.0,0.12205988455988455,0.2822691197691198,2023-05-17 08:23:00,2023-05-17 08:23:00,168.41000366210938,173.86000061035156,-5.4499969482421875

He added: “I work seven days per week, but I am not expecting others to do that.”Earlier this week Musk joked that he had slept “in the car” before a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron, hours after the billionaire was seen partying in Mexico and Los Angeles.The Tesla chief, who usually dresses in jeans and t-shirt, donned a suit for the 45-minute meeting with the French President but was unshaven.During the interview, Mr Musk was challenged over his recent remarks which cast doubt on claims that a mass shooter in Allen, Texas, was a white supremacist.The billionaire described claims that killer Mauricio Martinez Garcia had white supremecist beliefs as “bullshit” and alleged the investigative website that uncovered the links was ""a company that does pysops"".Psychological operations, or “pysops”, are military operations which use information or propaganda to sway public opinion, often via newspapers or other media, without the need for combat.Police in Texas have confirmed the mass shooter had Swastika tattoos and “neo-Nazi ideation”.Eliot Higgins, founder of the website Bellingcat, which first revealed the claims, said: “If Elon Musk thinks Bellingcat is a psyop then that is a reflection of the absolute garbage he consumes.”Bellingcat has been credited with uncovering Russian war crimes in Ukraine and first reporting the identities of two Kremlin agents who poisoned the exiled Sergei Skripal in Salisbury.The Tesla chief said he was willing to risk advertisers walking away from Twitter following his inflammatory remarks.Mr Musk compared Mr Soros, who is Jewish, to a supervillain who “hates humanity”.Jonathan Greenblatt, chief executive of the Anti-Defamation League, said: “Soros is often held up by the far-right, using anti-semitic tropes, as the source of the world's problems.”Mr Musk said: “I'll say what I want, and if the consequence of that is losing money, so be it.”Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

TSLA,"Futures edge higher as debt ceiling talks grind on, Target results eyed","By Chuck MikolajczakNEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose sharply on Wednesday, fueled by optimism over a potential deal on the $31.4 trillion federal debt ceiling and as a rebound in regional bank shares eased concerns about an escalation in the sector's troubles.President Joe Biden and top U.S. congressional Republican Kevin McCarthy on Wednesday reiterated their determination to strike a deal soon to raise the debt ceiling and avoid an economically catastrophic default.If an agreement is not reached by June 1, the U.S. Treasury has said it could begin to run out of funds to pay the government's bills, potentially igniting a recession.A jump in regional bank shares lifted sentiment, led by a 10.19% surge in Western Alliance Bancorp a day after the bank said deposits grew by more than $2 billion in the quarter ended May 12.The KBW regional bank shot up 7.28% to notch its biggest one-day percentage gain since Jan. 6, 2021 to close at its highest level since May 1. The S&P 500 banks index also surged 4.46% for its biggest daily percentage gain since Nov. 10.""It is optimism over the debt ceiling. It is continued optimism the banking crisis is in the rear-view mirror. Every day we go without a new problem, the closer we get to maybe putting it behind us,"" said Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments in New Vernon, New Jersey.""Definitely the catalyst is when you get both Biden and McCarthy to say that we are close the assumption is they probably will go with some kind of agreement.""The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 408.63 points, or 1.24%, to 33,420.77; the S&P 500 gained 48.87 points, or 1.19%, to 4,158.77; and the Nasdaq Composite added 157.51 points, or 1.28%, at 12,500.57.The gains marked the biggest one-day percentage climb for each of the three major indexes since May 5.Also providing support was a 4.41% advance in Tesla shares after its annual shareholder meeting on Tuesday.Top boss Elon Musk downplayed market speculation he may step down as CEO of Tesla, touched upon two new mass-market models the company is developing, and reaffirmed that deliveries of its long-delayed Cybertruck pickup would start this year.In addition, a source with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters the electric vehicle maker has proposed setting up a factory in India for domestic sale and export.With the rally the S&P is once again near the top of a recent trading range, at about 4,160, which has acted as a resistance point. Analysts said a major catalyst such as a debt ceiling agreement or clarity on the path of interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve would be needed to push stocks much higher.Recent data has indicated slowing in the U.S. economy following a string of Fed rate hikes to fight high inflation. That, along with recent negotiations over the U.S. debt ceiling, has focused attention on when the central bank will pause hiking, or cut interest rates.While the market is pricing in a rate cut by the year-end, recent comments from Fed officials suggested they are not ready to cut rates soon.Retailers Target Corp and TJX Companies Inc forecast current-quarter profit below expectations despite beating estimates for the first quarter.Shares of Target rose 2.58%, while TJX Companies closed 0.93% higher after a choppy session. The gains, along with Tesla's rally, helped lift the consumer discretionary sector about 2%.Volume on U.S. exchanges was 10.35 billion shares, compared with the 10.59 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a 2.95-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.45-to-1 ratio favored advancers.The S&P 500 posted 20 new 52-week highs and 14 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 69 new highs and 123 new lows.(Reporting by Chuck Mikolajczak; Editing by Richard Chang)","May 17, 2023 at 5:14 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/futures-edge-higher-debt-ceiling-101427168.html,Reuters,0.25,0.5,0.13219486531986532,0.47531776094276074,2023-05-17 05:14:00,2023-05-17 05:14:00,168.41000366210938,173.86000061035156,-5.4499969482421875

BABA,Alibaba Makes Another Step Towards Unlocking Value,"Revenue for the quarter ended on March 31st amounted to $29.6 billion, missing estimates but rising 2% YoY. Although non-GAAP diluted earnings per share missed expectations as they amounted to 1.34 yuan, they were up 35% YoY. The adjusted net profit rose 38% YoY as it rose up to $4.0 billion.Like Amazon, Walmart and Home Depot, Alibaba observed a slow start of the year with total sales of physical goods. But China, where Alibaba operates generates almost half of the world’s global online transactions, saw its retail sales in April rise 18.4% and Alibaba said it already observed a positive momentum in March after the initial slowdown. However, results didn’t show the improvement for March as analysts had hoped.While Microsoft topped cloud expectations with its latest reported quarter, this unit was a weak spot during the reported quarter as sales dropped 3% YoY, mostly due to January’s delivery delays due to COVID-19 restrictions as well as a loss of top overseas customer. Even Amazon warned of a cloud growth slowdown in its latest reported quarter.What is also interesting is that Alibaba’s quarterly report also came with a mission statement of the Chinese titan working to make cloud computing more affordable and accessible.Alibaba’s cloud comes hand in hand with AI. Like Microsoft, Alibaba developed its own ChatGPT-style generative AI tool earlier this year which is expected to help accelerate customer adoption of its cloud computing service. CEO Daniel Zhang is expecting this technology to bring an exponential increase in computing power.Alibaba’s story continues to be written as the company has taken steps towards unlocking the value of its business. While its tech peers in the U.S. are cautiously turning around, Alibaba’s results have significantly improved, with the latest results being significantly stronger from last year’s comparable quarter. Considering that the latest quarter had the strongest growth rate in the fiscal year that was just closed, momentum is on Alibaba’s side. Meanwhile, both Microsoft and Amazon gave cautious and lackluster guidance. If other things remain equal and this trend continues, Alibaba could bring in significantly higher profits in the undergoing fiscal year.DISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

BABA,China Tech Megacaps in a Funk Despite Upbeat Sales: Tech Watch,"(Bloomberg) -- Slowdown fears are weighing on Chinese tech stocks and even upbeat sales figures from the industry’s bellwethers can’t revive them.Most Read from BloombergMcCarthy Puts Debt-Limit Talks on ‘Pause’ as Clock Ticks DownDisney Closes Florida Star Wars Hotel, Scraps Plan to Move 2,000 EmployeesMorgan Stanley CEO Gorman to Step Down Within 12 MonthsWall Street Fears $1 Trillion Aftershock From Debt DealNYC Skyscrapers Sit Vacant, Exposing Risk City Never PredictedShares of Tencent Holdings Ltd. have fallen more than 2.5% in Hong Kong since China’s most valuable company announced its fastest revenue growth in more than a year on Wednesday. Similarly, the nation’s Internet search leader Baidu Inc. has declined over 2% following a stronger-than-expected sales report on Tuesday.The Hang Seng Tech Index has dropped more than 7% this year, trailing the Nasdaq 100 gauge’s gain of more than 26% in a reflection of the broader malaise afflicting Chinese equities. A slowing economic recovery with few signs of policy support and Beijing’s rift with Washington are undermining sentiment toward China’s assets.“I don’t really see much upside in the short term,” said Dickie Wong, executive director of research at Kingston Securities Ltd. “On the earnings front, JD.com and Baidu actually beat my expectation while Tencent and Alibaba are in line. But with a weaker yuan, geopolitical risks from the upcoming G-7 meeting and unresolved auditing issues, the market is more likely to remain in range-bound trading.”Chinese tech stocks have succumbed to the pull of gravity after investors’ hopes for a swift rebound in growth failed to materialize. Official data released this week showed China’s industrial output, retail sales and fixed investment grew at a much slower pace than expected in April. As a result, traders have been focusing more on bad news of late.Case in point: Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. slumped as much as 5.9% in Hong Kong on Friday as traders zeroed in on the firm’s weak sales growth even after the company laid out IPO plans for its logistics and grocery arms to unlock the group’s long-term value.During this earnings season, all the industry bellwethers seemed to have gotten a lid on costs — the new fixation for markets as once-phenomenal growth evaporated at the tail-end of the pandemic years. Investors are expecting more of the same when Kuaishou Technology and Xiaomi Corp. report next week.But that may not be enough to reverse the negative sentiment. Investors have pulled $256 million from the KraneShares CSI China Internet ETF this month, putting the vehicle on track for a fourth month of outflows, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Given all the uncertainties, tech shares are likely to remain in the doldrums for now.“The results of Baidu, JD and Tencent have lifted the bar for people’s expectation on the net profit side,” said Willer Chen, a senior research analyst at Forsyth Barr Asia Ltd. For tech companies reporting next week, investors are expecting topline growth to be “pretty tepid” while they wait for the guidance, he added.Tech Chart of the DayThe buzz around artificial intelligence and broad tech optimism are driving large bullish bets on the Nasdaq 100, with call-option volume hitting the highest level since 2014.

BABA,Alibaba to Exit Cloud Business After Beijing Undercuts Potential,"(Bloomberg) -- Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.’s surprise move to fully spin out a potentially transformative $12 billion cloud business is stirring speculation about whether the Chinese e-commerce leader bowed to market or political realities.Most Read from BloombergDisney Drops Plan to Move Workers to Florida, Closes HotelWall Street Fears $1 Trillion Aftershock From Debt DealNYC Skyscrapers Sit Vacant, Exposing Risk City Never PredictedUkraine Leader Zelenskiy to Visit Hiroshima in Bid to Rally AidMorgan Stanley CEO Gorman to Step Down Within 12 MonthsChief Executive Officer Daniel Zhang dropped a bombshell Thursday when he unveiled the contours of Alibaba’s historic six-way shakeup for the first time. Included among the listing and financing of a plethora of businesses was a plan to fully relinquish control of the business known as Alibaba Cloud, a once-thriving operation that harbored the potential to supercharge the company the way Amazon Web Services grew to signify Amazon.com Inc.At the heart of the issue is why Alibaba chose to sever a business some analysts value at upwards of $30 billion, a prime beneficiary of a post-ChatGPT upswell that depends on cloud resources to train next-generation AI models. In doing so, it’s hiving off a unit that comes with historical baggage and its own share of business uncertainty. Alibaba dived as much as 5.9% in Hong Kong Friday, after also reporting disappointing Chinese commerce figures.China’s most valuable online commerce firm invested tens of billions over more than a decade in the business of hosting computing for corporations over the internet. For years, it was among Alibaba’s proudest and most often-touted accomplishments, a business that outstripped rival offerings from Tencent Holdings Ltd. and Baidu Inc., grew more global in flavor than any other division, and spearheaded important inhouse initiatives.But government scrutiny of cloud services operated by private firms intensified around 2020, when Beijing grew suspicious of privately owned repositories of sensitive and valuable data, triggering a now-infamous sweeping crackdown on the internet sphere. AliCloud itself drew regulatory ire in 2021 for discovering then sharing a major software flaw before informing authorities, and was then investigated in 2022 for its role in China’s largest known cybersecurity data leak. The cloud division in recent years began to bleed market share to rivals including Huawei Technologies Co. and state-run China Mobile Ltd.“It’s positive for shareholders as it represents a significant capital return, but once fully distributed the cloud business will no longer add to Alibaba Holdco’s valuation,” said Vey Sern Ling, managing director at Union Bancaire Privee. “The company says cloud business is relatively independent and unrelated to its core e-commerce businesses. But investors may wonder if the government told them to break up.”Read more: Alibaba Breakup Begins With Spinoff of $12 Billion Cloud ArmKey Points of the Breakup BlueprintAlibaba plans to spin off its cloud services division as an independent entity by distributing stock to shareholders over the next yearThat means Alibaba could eventually end up not owning shares in China’s biggest cloud services platformIt will aim to float its Cainiao logistics arm within 12 to 18 monthsMost immediately, the firm aims to complete an IPO for the Freshippo grocery chain within the coming yearAnd it plans to secure external financing for its international commerce division, which encompasses overseas operations such as Singapore-based LazadaLike Amazon’s, Alibaba’s cloud service emerged from the computational power needed to handle millions of simultaneous online shopping transactions. But unlike its US counterpart, it enjoyed home-field advantage in a vast Chinese market where web-based computing was (and still is) novel to many enterprises. Its push into the cloud, where software and services are provided to customers via server farms the size of football fields, was once envisioned as helping cushion Alibaba against domestic shocks to its core operation.Zhang said Thursday the cloud arm pretty much runs itself as an independent operation. But it’s also inextricably intertwined with some of the company’s most pivotal undertakings.Cloud drives its signature Singles’ Day gala, an annual event that showcases the company’s enormous global reach in online shopping. It helped power hundreds of thousands of transactions per second — a phenomenal endeavor Alibaba has unfailingly credited the cloud division with enabling. The unit contributed to profit for the first time around late 2020, helping prop up the bottom line just as Covid-era shocks hammered shopping. And it houses the DAMO academy that works on potentially groundbreaking, moonshot projects from chip design to quantum computing.Read more: Scrutiny of Alibaba in Record Breach May Ensnare All China TechIn fiscal 2022, it generated nearly $12 billion of revenue for the company — 8% of turnover. It was so important that in March, when Alibaba first unveiled its six-way breakup, Zhang personally took the helm of what he called the Cloud Intelligence division — seemingly signaling it was destined for greater things.“This full spinoff plan involving AliCloud is both bold and puzzling,” Nomura Holdings Inc analysts Jialong Shi and Thomas Shen wrote in a note. Their current valuation for the unit stands at about $31 billion. “AliCloud is BABA’s organic business and is still deemed as one of the long-term drivers for the group even though its growth temporarily slowed down in recent quarters due to macro headwinds. That is why we find it puzzling that BABA has decided to fully spin off this business instead of retaining a minority stake at least.”The tide had turned against the business several years before. Beijing’s relentless and widespread crackdown on its formerly high-flying tech giants since late 2020 had nudged risk-averse institutions toward state-owned providers.Large-scale businesses like the China Construction Bank and local municipalities in cities such as Nantong were already moving closer to state-backed cloud platforms, Bloomberg News has reported.Ultimately, Alibaba may have acceded to business considerations. Zhang said the cloud spinoff was intended to simplify the structure and respond to market needs. A standalone platform could grow to someday even surpass Alibaba in size if it attracted the right external financing, he told analysts Thursday without elaborating.“The planned spin-out comes at a challenging time for the Cloud business, which seems to have lost the growth initiative,” said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Robert Lea.Read more: Alibaba’s $32 Billion Day Signals Breakups for China Tech--With assistance from Vlad Savov.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekApple’s New Headset Meets RealityThe True Cost of an Extended US Debt-Ceiling StandoffJapan’s New Military Might Is Rising in a Factory in HiroshimaESG Investing Goes Quiet After Blistering Republican AttacksSweetgreen Tests Robots to Make Faster, More Efficient Sad Desk Salads©2023 Bloomberg L.P.","May 19, 2023 at 12:48 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alibaba-exit-cloud-business-beijing-054846289.html,Bloomberg,0.0,1.0,0.12283658443296998,0.4327474399763556,2023-05-19 00:48:00,2023-05-19 00:48:00,83.8499984741211,83.9800033569336,-0.1300048828125
BABA,"Alibaba shares sink on quarterly revenue miss, weak China outlook","Investing.com -- Hong Kong-listed shares of e-commerce giant Alibaba Group (HK:9988) sank on Friday as a slowing economic rebound and growing competition in China, its biggest market, spurred disappointing quarterly earnings.Alibaba’s Hong Kong shares sank more than 5%, tracking a similar overnight decline in the firm’s American Depository Receipts (NYSE:BABA). The stock took little support from Alibaba saying that it will spin off and list its cloud unit within the year.While the stock had received some support in recent sessions, especially as the “Big Short’s” Michael Burry doubled his stake in the firm, Friday’s losses saw it unwind most recent gains, with the stock now trading just above a two-month low.Alibaba’s Chinese direct sales, which make up the biggest portion of its revenue, fell 1% in the quarter, as consumer spending in China continued to struggle despite the lifting of anti-COVID measures.Revenue from other China-focused businesses also declined, as the firm faces increased competition from other e-commerce entrants, including JD.com (HK:9618) (NASDAQ:JD) and PDD Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:PDD).While Chinese consumer spending rose somewhat this year, it still remained well below pre-COVID levels. But it still helped Alibaba log a net profit of RMB23.52B for the year, compared to a loss of RMB16.24B last year.The firm also faces a brewing price war in its cloud business with rival Tencent Holdings Ltd (HK:0700), amid weak corporate demand and excess capacity in the space.Alibaba is also attempting to break into the generative artificial intelligence space with its Tongyi Qianwen model, which it had revealed last month. The firm has now opened up registration to test the technology for Alibaba Cloud’s enterprise customers.The broader Hong Kong Hang Seng index fell 1.1% on Friday, as losses in Alibaba spilled over into other heavyweight technology stocks.Related ArticlesAlibaba shares sink on quarterly revenue miss, weak China outlookEuropean stocks rise; Smiths Group earnings, G7 meeting eyedNikkei powers to Japan's 1990 'bubble' era peak","May 18, 2023 at 8:36 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alibaba-shares-sink-quarterly-revenue-013631051.html,Investing.com-5.41%,-0.375,0.625,-0.048863636363636366,0.38358585858585853,2023-05-18 20:36:00,2023-05-19 10:30:00,83.8499984741211,83.9800033569336,-0.1300048828125

BABA,Alibaba Breakup Begins With Spinoff of $12 Billion Cloud Arm,"(Bloomberg) -- Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. will explore initial public offerings for its logistics and grocery arms while hiving off its $12 billion cloud business, kicking off the first phase of a much-anticipated breakup to try and revive anemic revenue growth.Most Read from BloombergMcCarthy Puts Debt-Limit Talks on ‘Pause’ as Clock Ticks DownDisney Closes Florida Star Wars Hotel, Scraps Plan to Move 2,000 EmployeesMorgan Stanley CEO Gorman to Step Down Within 12 MonthsWall Street Fears $1 Trillion Aftershock From Debt DealNYC Skyscrapers Sit Vacant, Exposing Risk City Never PredictedChief Executive Officer Daniel Zhang outlined the contours of that historic shakeup for the first time, which starts with the listing of its grocery arm Freshippo as early as six months from now, before proceeding to the float of its giant Cainiao logistics arm over the next year to 18 months. Significantly, Alibaba will completely carve out the nation’s biggest cloud services platform as a dividend to shareholders, meaning it could relinquish control of one of its fastest-growing businesses.Zhang said the cloud spinoff was intended to simplify the structure and respond to market needs. A standalone platform could grow to someday even surpass Alibaba in size if it attracted the right external financing, he said without elaborating. Analysts have in the past argued that private clouds could operate at a disadvantage to state-backed rivals given Beijing’s growing insistence on using government-controlled data storage and internet services.Investors harbored hopes that Alibaba’s March decision to split itself into six units might galvanize the market, enable the different operations to move more nimbly and fuel a share rebound. Each unit, except for the core Taobao Tmall Commerce Group, was freed to seek independent fundraising and listings.Still, Zhang unveiled that grand vision after China’s e-commerce leader posted its third consecutive quarter of single-digit revenue growth, reinforcing concerns that a Chinese consumer spending rebound may be farther out than anticipated. Domestic commerce shrank 3% in the March quarter, while the cloud division, the other closely watched business, was down 2% — its first-ever decline on record. Alibaba shares closed 5.4% lower at $85.77 in New York.That lackluster showing underscores how China may be recovering from years of Covid Zero restrictions at a slower pace than projected, hampered by US sanctions and an uncertain global economic environment. Hopes that Beijing would support private enterprise this year after a blistering crackdown on the internet sector haven’t translated into meaningful policy so far.What Bloomberg Intelligence SaysAlibaba’s first-ever cloud-revenue decline heightens the importance of new strategic investors to revive the business’ growth after it’s spun off in the next 12 months. A drop in Alibaba’s fiscal 4Q direct sales, which include Freshippo revenue, also raises doubts about the grocer’s catalysts after its IPO, slated within 6-12 months. Cainiao, set to list in 12-18 months, had the lowest 4Q logistics-revenue growth in four years.- Catherine Lim and Trini Tan, analystsClick here for the research.As part of the overall restructuring, Alibaba plans to dispatch about half of its investment team to the six different business units that will be created after the breakup. That team has historically been at the vanguard of a nationwide investment spree that helped extend Alibaba’s influence and fend off competition from JD.com Inc. and Tencent Holdings Ltd.“This transformation will empower all our businesses to become more agile, enhance decision-making, enable faster responses to market change,” Zhang told analysts on a conference call.Key Points of the Breakup BlueprintAlibaba plans to spin off its cloud services division as an independent entity by distributing stock to shareholders over the next yearThat means Alibaba could eventually end up not owning shares in China’s biggest cloud services platformIt will aim to float its Cainiao logistics arm within 12 to 18 monthsMost immediately, the firm aims to complete an IPO for the Freshippo grocery chain within the coming yearAnd it plans to secure external financing for its international commerce division, which encompasses overseas operations such as Singapore-based LazadaAlibaba reported sales of 208.2 billion yuan for the March quarter, lagging an average analyst estimate for 209.2 billion yuan. Net income was 23.5 billion yuan, reversing losses from a year ago thanks to once-off gains.Investors had bet that consumer spending and the tech sector would rebound after Beijing lifted years of sweeping restrictions that hobbled the world’s No. 2 economy. But economists point to slowing trade and other signs the nascent recovery is losing steam. During the recent Golden Week holiday, an important indicator of broader sentiment, overall spending lagged behind booking volumes.Despite overall malaise, there’re hints online commerce is at least rounding a corner.Gross merchandise value growth in China’s e-commerce industry accelerated to 11% in March after slowing to 5% in the first two months of 2023, according to estimates by Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which cited recovering demand and easing logistics disruptions. Last week, JD said volume growth this quarter was outpacing the previous three months, helping prop up its stock.Tencent grew revenue at its fastest pace since 2021, while Baidu Inc. also posted sales beyond estimates. Both credited a recovery in segments of domestic consumption. Michael Burry, the money manager made famous in The Big Short, boosted his bullish bets on JD and Alibaba even as other hedge funds cooled on the nation’s reopening trades.For now, Alibaba is pushing cost-cuts to shore up margins and offset anemic domestic growth — a sea-change for a tech deal-maker that once spent aggressively to dominate swaths of the economy. The crackdown on online commerce by the Xi Jinping administration has also forced Alibaba to alter a business model that once pursued merchant exclusivity.“In the past few months, we have noticed a gradual recovery in China consumption, but consumer confidence and spending power still need further momentum,” Zhang said. “At the same time, competition among the multiple consumption platforms is still fierce, and everyone is trying to capture the incremental demands with more value-for-money products and services.”That bottom-line focus is taking on urgency because of fierce competition in its home market from JD, PDD Holdings Inc. and up-and-comers such as ByteDance Ltd., which have stepped efforts to lure customers and woo merchants.Overseas, the tech giant is curtailing its global ambitions. Alibaba sold off the last of its shares in Indian fintech giant Paytm this month, accelerating a withdrawal from the world’s fastest-growing mobile and internet arena.--With assistance from Zheping Huang, Debby Wu, Jennifer Ryan and Peter Elstrom.(Adds closing share price in fifth paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekApple’s New Headset Meets RealityJapan’s New Military Might Is Rising in a Factory in HiroshimaESG Investing Goes Quiet After Blistering Republican AttacksThe True Cost of an Extended US Debt-Ceiling StandoffSweetgreen Tests Robots to Make Faster, More Efficient Sad Desk Salads©2023 Bloomberg L.P.","May 18, 2023 at 3:17 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alibaba-plans-unit-ipos-sales-113819808.html,Bloomberg,0.0,0.0,0.04984740674395847,0.3295786269924201,2023-05-18 15:17:00,2023-05-18 15:17:00,90.80999755859376,85.7699966430664,5.040000915527358

It also reversed losses from the same quarter last year, posting a net income of 23.5 billion yuan ($3.3 billion) due to one-off gains from its equity investments.Revenue from its China commerce business — Alibaba’s largest business unit by revenue — declined 3% compared with the same period last year.

He speaks with David Ingles, Yvonne Man and Rishaad Salamat on ""Bloomberg Markets Asia"".","May 17, 2023 at 10:44 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/ubps-vey-sern-ling-alibaba-034449053.html,Bloomberg,0.0,0.0,-0.125,0.375,2023-05-17 22:44:00,2023-05-18 10:30:00,90.80999755859376,85.7699966430664,5.040000915527358
BABA,3 Intriguing Stocks to Watch as Earnings Approach,"As investors continue to digest quarterly results, several notable companies are reporting earnings on Thursday, May 18.Here are three stocks investors will want to watch as they are instrumental to their respective industries and could rise on strong quarterly reports.We'll start with Applied Materials, out of the tech sector and a notable name among semiconductor stocks.Many eyes will be on Applied Material as one of the world’s largest suppliers of equipment for the fabrication of semiconductors, flat panel liquid crystal displays (LCDs), and solar photovoltaic (PV) cells and modules.At the moment Applied Materials stock lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) with its Semiconductor Equipment-Water Fabrication Industry in the top 49% of over 250 Zacks industries.Applied Materials’ fiscal second-quarter results and guidance will provide a broader context on the outlook for many semiconductor companies. Earnings are forecasted to be roughly on par with the prior-year quarter at $1.84 per share with Q2 sales expected to rise 2% to $6.40 billion.Annual earnings are projected to decline -9% this year and dip another -5% in FY24 at $6.67 per share following exceptional years for EPS growth in 2021 and 2022. With that being said, earnings estimate revisions have gone up over the last quarter and strong Q2 results could catapult Applied Materials stock which is still up +129% over the last three years to largely outperform the broader indexes.Quarterly results from big retailers have highlighted this week’s earnings lineup and one company investors will not want to overlook is Ross Stores.Ross Stores has carved a unique niche as an off-price retailer of apparel and home accessories and currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) with its Retail-Discount Stores Industry also in the top 49% of all Zacks industries.Ross Stores’ first-quarter earnings are expected to rise 9% YoY at $1.06 per share with sales projected to be up 4% from the prior-year quarter to $4.49 billion. Even better, Ross Stores’ annual EPS growth is very attractive at the moment.Earnings are anticipated to jump 12% in Ross Stores’ current fiscal 2024 and rise another 10% in FY25 at $5.40 per share. If Ross Stores’ first-quarter report helps reconfirm this growth trajectory shares of ROST could gain some nice momentum.Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba is another company investors will want to watch on Thursday. There could be some nice upside potential for Alibaba stock as logistic and supply chain issues begin to subside with China’s economy back in full flux.Alibaba also lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at the moment and its Internet-Commerce Industry is in the top 36% of all Zacks industries. The business conglomerate’s fiscal fourth-quarter earnings are expected to rise 4% from Q4 2022 at $1.30 per share. This is despite Q4 sales forecasted to dip -6% to $30.35 billion.The earnings potential for Alibaba has always been intriguing with EPS now expected to be down -5% this year but rebound and rise 6% in FY24 at $8.31 per share. After a strong start to 2023 upon China reopening its borders Alibaba stock has since cooled off but a strong quarter and affirmation of a stable operating environment could get the rally going again.TakeawayAlibaba (BABA), Applied Materials (AMAT), and Ross Stores (ROST) are three companies investors will definitely want to watch this week. As unique leaders in their space, strong quarterly results on Thursday could give a nice boost to these stocks and they are viable long-term investments worth holding onto at the moment.Ross Stores, Inc.

BABA,"Walmart reports, Alibaba earnings, Applied Materials: 3 things to watch","Investing.com -- Stocks surged on Wednesday amid hopes that Congress will hammer out a deal on raising the debt ceiling, allowing the U.S. to avoid the possibility of defaulting on its obligations.Lawmakers were still busy on the details after a meeting at the White House on Tuesday, though they could reach an agreement in the next few days.The drama has been unfolding for weeks, since the government officially hit the ceiling of $31.4 trillion in January. The Treasury has been working around the cap since then but could run out of options by early June if an agreement isn't reached.President Joe Biden is heading off to Japan and the G-7 meeting of world leaders this weekend and said earlier today he would have a press conference on Sunday to update on the progress of the talks.Retail earnings continue with Walmart reporting tomorrow morning.

BABA,TikTok's sister app Douyin says GMV for e-commerce business grew 80 per cent last year,"Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok that has been aggressively pushing online shopping as a way to convert eyeballs into revenues, said its gross merchandise volume (GMV) on the platform grew 80 per cent last year.Douyin's owner, Beijing-based ByteDance, set up a dedicated e-commerce unit in 2020 but has never publicly released the total GMV figure. US news media The Information reported in January that the GMV last year was 1.41 trillion yuan (US$202.3 billion), citing two sources.Wei Wenwen, president of Douyin's e-commerce unit, said on Tuesday that the company will invest 10 billion yuan this year to help merchants grow their business on the platform, which she said saw GMV growth of 80 per cent last year. Wei, who spoke at Douyin's Ecosystem Conference held in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou, added that the company has ""confidence in future growth"".That is in spite of slower growth from 2021, when GMV more than tripled from a very low base in 2020, when the e-commerce business started.The emergence of Douyin as a major e-commerce player has changed China's online shopping landscape and challenged the dominant positions of Alibaba Group Holding and JD.com. ByteDance is also using its experience at home to help TikTok generate revenue in overseas markets.Douyin's turnover is still a fraction of established platforms such as Alibaba and JD.com. Alibaba's Chinese retail businesses, including e-commerce and digital media, achieved GMV of nearly 8 trillion yuan for the year ended March 2022, while JD.com reported GMV of roughly 3.48 trillion yuan for 2022. Alibaba owns the South China Morning Post.ByteDance is a latecomer to the industry, as online shopping started to take off in China in the 2000s. However, unlike the bigger platforms where consumers browsed and searched on still web pages, Douyin took advantage of its short videos and live streaming to promote and sell goods.Last year, Douyin launched a ""marketplace"" tab on its home page next to the short video feed. The channel takes the appearance of a traditional online shopping site by placing listings in columns, thus encroaching on the turf of its bigger rivals. At the same time, mainstream online shopping sites like Taobao, JD.com and Pinduoduo have turned to live streaming to promote sales.Wei said GMV generated from the ""marketplace"" channel contributed to more than 30 per cent of the total in 2022. Its video feed and marketplace shopping outlets ""allow users to revisit [a listing] and repurchase [goods], bringing incremental sales"", Wei said at the conference on Tuesday, the third such event held since 2021, which brings Douyin merchants and customers together for business discussions.Chinese women are seen selling rice during a live stream on Douyin in this photo taken August 5, 2022. Photo: Luna Sun alt=Chinese women are seen selling rice during a live stream on Douyin in this photo taken August 5, 2022. Photo: Luna Sun>During Douyin's shopping festival held from September 9-21, there were 397 products and 3,950 live streaming sessions that each achieved GMV of more than 1 million yuan, the company announced, without disclosing the total GMV.ByteDance has been trying to diversify its revenue sources, including expanding into food deliveries and hotel reservations, as income growth slows amid economic headwinds and as its initial public offering plans remain in limbo.The company's revenue grew more than 30 per cent to exceed US$80 billion in 2022, down from growth rates of 70 per cent and 111 per cent in the two previous years, according to reports from Bloomberg and Reuters.Copyright (c) 2023.

BABA,Tencent cuts cloud service prices up to 40% to fend off rivals,"By Josh YeHONG KONG (Reuters) -Chinese internet giant Tencent Holdings is cutting prices for cloud services by up to 40% from June amid similar moves from rivals that have plunged the sector into a price war.The fierce competition comes amid soft corporate demand, with the Chinese economy in the midst of a wobbly recovery since abandoning strict COVID-19 restrictions last year.Alibaba Group Holding Ltd said last month it would slash prices for some cloud products by up to 50%. State-owned China Mobile joined Tencent on Tuesday in announcing cuts, saying prices for some services would be reduced by up to 60% for a limited time.Charlie Chai, an analyst at 86Research, said Chinese cloud service providers had in the past made efforts to avert a price war but ""at the end of the day they still went down this path"". He noted the companies had expanded aggressively and now had too much capacity.Wei Yunfeng, a researcher at data firm IDC, said the price cuts were triggered in part by high sales targets despite slowing growth for the market.Chai said a more challenging cloud market would force companies to focus on product differentiation and that Baidu was well positioned as it had ""unique, AI-centric products"".""For participants that choose to join the war, the near-term margin impact can be significant,"" he said, estimating it could take 4 to 7 percentage points off their cloud operating profit margins.Alibaba's cloud revenue accounts for about 9% of its total revenue. Tencent does not provide separate figures for cloud revenue.Tencent on Wednesday marked a return to revenue growth in the first quarter as it recovered from COVID-related disruptions and a regulatory freeze on gaming licences a year earlier.James Mitchell, Tencent's chief strategy officer, told analysts on a call: ""The impact of price cuts on Tencent as a whole is not notable.""Mitchell said cloud services only represent ""a mid single digit percentage"" of Tencent's total revenue.Moreover, price cuts only apply to its infrastructure-as-a-service business, which represent only a portion of Tencent's cloud services.Alibaba reports on Thursday.(Reporting by Josh Ye; Editing by Edwina Gibbs and Bernadette Baum)","May 17, 2023 at 4:28 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tencent-slashes-cloud-prices-40-092856377.html,Reuters,0.0,0.0,0.03747055811571941,0.46863543266769075,2023-05-17 04:28:00,2023-05-17 04:28:00,88.45999908447266,90.68000030517578,-2.220001220703125

BABA,"China: Economic data misses expectations, tech earnings on tap","U.S. equity markets opened lower and turned mixed on the heels of disappointing retail sales data and weak guidance from home improvement retailer, Home Depot Inc. (NYSE: HD). Retail sales rose by just 0.4% in April –– missing forecasts calling for an increase of 0.8%, following the retreat in March. Ahead of a slew of earnings from U.S. retailers, Home Depot shares slid over 1% in morning trade as it slashed its sales and earnings forecasts for the year.Overseas in China, economic data releases reflected an economy that is still in recovery. Key data including retail sales, industrial production, fixed asset investment, and manufacturing PMI came in below expectations.Earnings from Baidu Inc. (NASDAQ: BIDU) topped earnings estimates with Q1 revenue rising by 10% as businesses boosted ad spending. Baidu shares advanced on Tuesday, extending a higher close ahead of quarterly results. Separately, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. (NYSE: BABA) is scheduled to report an improvement in EPS and revenue when it releases earnings on Thursday.China abandoned strict COVID restrictions at the end of last year. Some investors took bets on the reopening trade in the economy. Q1 2023 GDP for China expanded 4.5% but only time will tell if momentum will remain strong among businesses in the world’s second-largest economy.And we did get some double digit percentage gains. But at the same time, they still came in weaker than estimates. Taking a closer look at the April data coming out from China, we saw retail sales rising 18.4%. Industrial production up 5.6% year over year. And fixed asset investment up by 4.7%. At the same time, we got two readings in terms of manufacturing PMI out from China. But they both came in below the 50 reading.And moving on to company stocks, let's take a look at Baidu. Baidu reported first quarter revenue that did top estimates. Now, keep in mind that revenue rose by 10%. And this did come as businesses upped their advertising spend. Strict COVID restrictions were dropped in the end of 2022. And this was the first reading for the company following those lifting of restrictions. Although we did see gains for the company before the closing bell, we are seeing that stock hover near the flat line this morning.Now, I want to move over to Alibaba. The company will report earnings ahead of the opening bell here in the US on Thursday, May 18. Now, ahead of that, forecasts do call for an increase in EPS as well as improvement in revenue. This does come after the fourth quarter '22 figures did post an EPS miss. Meanwhile, Alibaba announced that it is splitting its business into six separate units. And the company says this new decentralized structure could save the company a whopping $1 billion before the end of 2023.We are seeing shares of the e-commerce giant trade on the-- on near flat today. But following that announcement earlier this year in March, we did see Alibaba shares pop by double digits. And I do want to mention one thing. Money manager Michael Burry of the long short fame made a contrarian bet on Alibaba. And this is according to the latest 13F filings that were released on the SEC website on Monday.Now, keep in mind that China's economy is still recovering, and its latest GDP figures gained by 4 and 1/2% earlier this year. So compared to the US, we are seeing upside in terms of economic data. But at the same time, it might not be enough to improve sentiment over in China.","May 16, 2023 at 1:40 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/china-economic-data-misses-expectations-184029093.html,Yahoo Finance Video,0.2,0.2,0.09154040404040405,0.40883838383838383,2023-05-16 13:40:00,2023-05-16 13:40:00,87.11000061035156,88.76000213623047,-1.6500015258789062

Xixi Campus Park A retains the original ecological environment, including the willows, bamboo, and persimmons.We've built trails along the wetland and constructed semi-open office spaces and meeting areas along the wetland to connect our employees and nature.All future new constructions by Alibaba will meet the LEED Gold standard and the China green building standard.Alibaba launched a number of initiatives and mechanisms to encourage every Alibaba employee to participate in a low-carbon lifestyle.For example, we launched ""Youxin,"" a platform to guide and motivate employees to participate in low-carbon actions.Every Alibaba employee can earn points by taking low-carbon emission actions on the platform. The points can be redeemed for green-themed souvenirs or other employee benefits.As new technologies emerge, Alibaba has been keeping tabs on emerging technologies. While we reduce carbon emissions in our own office parks and constructions, we are also considering additional investment in green energy.View original content hereView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Alibaba Group on 3blmedia.com.","May 16, 2023 at 8:00 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alibaba-deploys-green-technologies-throughout-130000206.html,ACCESSWIRE,-0.2,0.3,0.1704978354978355,0.45943722943722937,2023-05-16 08:00:00,2023-05-16 08:00:00,87.11000061035156,88.76000213623047,-1.6500015258789062

BABA,Michael Burry Doubles Alibaba Stake in Big Bet on China Tech,"(Bloomberg) -- Michael Burry, the money manager made famous in The Big Short, now has a Big Long when it comes to China. He boosted his bullish bets on e-commerce giants JD.com Inc. and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., even as other hedge funds cooled on the nation’s reopening trades.Most Read from BloombergA 32-Year-Old Nears Billionaire Status by Using AI to Broker Japan MergersMichael Burry Doubles Alibaba Stake in Big Bet on China TechTurkey Latest: Erdogan Says Unclear If Vote Will Go to RunoffChicago’s Empty Office Towers Threaten Its Future as a Major Financial HubTurkey Set for Runoff as Erdogan Falls Just Short of VictoryThe two stocks have become the largest holdings of his Scion Asset Management, accounting for 20% of his stock portfolio. His success relies not only on the companies recovering their mojo but also surviving the geopolitical risks that drove many of his peers away.Burry, who rose to fame after predicting the 2008 housing crash, made headlines Monday after revealing in a 13F filing that he scooped up regional lenders during the banking turmoil in the first quarter.READ MORE: Michael Burry Loaded Up on Bank Stocks in Tumultuous Quarter (1)That wasn’t his only contrarian bet. After purchasing Alibaba and JD.com in the final months of 2022 as China ended the Covid Zero policy, Burry boosted the holdings of the two last quarter. His stake in JD.com more than tripled to 250,000 shares, worth $11 million, or 11% of his portfolio. He also doubled holdings of Alibaba to $10 million.The vote of confidence came as many of his peers offloaded the stocks. As a group, hedge funds sold 4 million shares of JD.com, according to 13F filings. The reduction of $451 million, which includes the valuation change of the stock during the quarter, marked one of the largest declines among US-listed companies.Alibaba’s shares rose as much as 1.6% in Hong Kong on Tuesday, while JD.com jumped 4.7%. The moves track a Monday rally in the Nasdaq Golden Dragon China Index as Alibaba’s promise of “huge” investments in its Taobao shopping app and the US securities regulator clearing its fiscal 2022 report also supported sentiment.In general, though, the so-called reopening trades have been disappointing. The MSCI China Index is flat for the year as the economy shows signs of losing momentum. China’s consumer spending and industrial activity grew at a slower pace than expected in April, data showed Tuesday, underscoring the recovery’s weakness.Hedge funds’ net exposure to China has dropped to 10.5% from 13.3% in January, according to data from Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s Prime Services unit.JD and Alibaba haven’t been performing well since their reopening rally faltered at the end of January. JD’s US-listed shares have lost 32% this year, while Alibaba is little changed, even as it carried out an historic overhaul. Last week, JD reported the lowest-ever pace of revenue growth.Earnings estimates for the Hang Seng Tech Index have been slashed to near record lows as fierce competitions in the e-commerce sector pressured margins. Alibaba’s first-quarter results are scheduled on Thursday, with analysts estimating a sub-3% increase in sales. These are a far cry from the go-go days before the pandemic and Beijing’s 2021 clampdown on Big Tech.Burry made his name as a contrarian, and that hasn’t changed.

BABA,Alibaba Vows Historic Investment in Taobao and Content,"(Bloomberg) -- Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.’s e-commerce division will make “huge” investments in its Taobao shopping app, as the newly created arm seeks to ward off competition from social media platforms.Most Read from BloombergSingapore Air Hands Staff Eight Months’ Salary Bonus After Record ResultsWall Street Fears $1 Trillion Aftershock From Debt DealDisney Drops Plan to Move Workers to Florida, Closes HotelHere’s How Much Wealth You Need to Join the Richest 1% GloballySam Zell, Billionaire Real Estate Investor, Dies at 81The subsidiary aims to focus on content creation as a conduit to bring in more users and will also launch artificial intelligence-powered tools for merchants, said Trudy Dai, chief executive officer of the Taobao Tmall Commerce Group.That push is likely a response to a still-anemic online commerce market and growing competition from ByteDance Ltd.’s Douyin and other short-video and livestreaming platforms. As young people buy more goods they see on video, incumbent leaders like Alibaba face pressure to deliver a similar experience. Taobao will make “timely adjustments” to its platform fees and commission rates to benefit merchants, according to Dai. They’ll also be provided with an expanding suite of free smart operation tools.“We will make huge, historic investments to scale up the user base for the benefit of merchants,” she said at a conference last Wednesday, in remarks shared by the company on Monday. “We will drive content creation in all areas, with much larger investment in content than ever before.”Alibaba’s shares gained 3.5% in US trading, in part because its annual report cleared a previously disclosed regulatory review.Alibaba, JD.com Earnings Set to Make Tough Reading: Tech WatchThe announcement comes ahead of Alibaba’s first-quarter results on Thursday, with analysts estimating a sub-3% sales increase as the industry grapples with China’s uneven post-pandemic recovery and the lingering impact of Beijing’s crackdown on Big Tech. Last week, closest rival JD.com Inc. posted a 1.4% gain in revenue for the quarter, its slowest pace of growth on record.As the country’s online commerce leader, Alibaba carried out an historic overhaul in March to create six new companies, paving the way for its cloud, logistics, and ecommerce units to debut on public markets.CEO Daniel Zhang said at the time that the company would consider gradually giving up control of some of the units, and already there have been preparations for initial public offerings in Hong Kong for the logistics arm, Cainiao Network Technology Co., and its grocery chain Freshippo. More recently, the group’s international online shopping unit has also been said to be exploring a US public listing.Taobao Tmall would be the one exception and the plan is for it to remain a wholly-owned Alibaba entity, executives have said.Dai didn’t provide more specifics about AI. Along with China’s other tech leaders, Alibaba has made AI development a priority as a flurry of investments and talent have entered the burgeoning sector following the launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT. The company has said it expects to incorporate its large language model, Tongyi Qianwen, into all of its products and services in the near future, even as Beijing’s regulators have signaled it will mandate a security review of generative AI services before they can be put into operation.Read more: JD’s CEO Exits After a Year at the Helm as Growth Dwindles--With assistance from Jinshan Hong.(Updates with share action and previous comments from the first paragraph)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekApple’s New Headset Meets RealityThe True Cost of an Extended US Debt-Ceiling StandoffSweetgreen Tests Robots to Make Faster, More Efficient Sad Desk SaladsRecession Calls Keep Getting Pushed Back, Giving Soft Landing Believers HopePeyton Manning’s Omaha Productions Becomes a Media Powerhouse©2023 Bloomberg L.P.","May 15, 2023 at 7:52 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alibaba-vows-historic-investment-taobao-005218508.html,Bloomberg,0.0,0.0,0.06936272344435611,0.38285846806254964,2023-05-15 19:52:00,2023-05-15 19:52:00,87.12999725341797,88.33999633789062,-1.2099990844726562

Alibaba owns the South China Morning Post.Alibaba Cloud, which is under the direct management of Alibaba chairman and CEO Daniel Zhang Yong, was the top cloud infrastructure services provider in mainland China last year, but its revenue growth has slowed amid competition from Huawei Technologies Co and China Telecom.During the December quarter of 2022, Alibaba Cloud posted a 3 per cent year-on-year increase in revenue, marking the unit's slowest quarterly growth last year.

BABA,Is Alibaba (BABA) a Buy as Wall Street Analysts Look Optimistic?,"The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?Alibaba currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.04, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 14 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.04 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 14 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 13 are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 92.9% and 7.1% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for BABAAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.ABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.Should You Invest in BABA?Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for Alibaba, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $7.85.Analysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Alibaba.

BABA,JDs CEO Exits After a Year at the Helm as Growth Dwindles,"(Bloomberg) -- JD.com Inc.’s chief executive officer is departing after only about a year at the post, a surprise move that coincides with the Chinese internet retailer’s slowest pace of growth on record.Most Read from BloombergJamie Dimon Says US Needs to 'Finish' the Bank CrisisTurkey Markets Rally as Candidate Withdraws Days Before VoteDimon Jabs at Trump on Debt Ceiling, Says JPMorgan Has War RoomKen Griffin’s Hand-Picked Math Prodigy Runs Market-Making EmpireTraders Embrace Bonds as Recession Angst Builds: Markets WrapXu Lei is departing China’s No. 2 online commerce firm after more than a decade of climbing the ranks, handing the reins to Chief Financial Officer Sandy Xu starting June. While the outgoing CEO only officially took up his role around April 2022, he headed up JD’s core retail division for years and was once regarded as heir apparent to billionaire founder and Chairman Richard Liu.Analysts said the personnel change suggests a shift in focus toward profitability, as the firm struggles with competition from PDD Holdings Inc. and ByteDance Ltd. JD’s shares climbed more than 4% in pre-market trading in New York.The management shuffle was announced after JD on Thursday reported revenue grew 1.4% to of 242.96 billion yuan ($35 billion). That beat projections but was the company’s lowest-ever pace of expansion. It swung from a loss to net income of 6.3 billion yuan in the March quarter, helped by 2.8 billion yuan of investment gains.JD.com Gains as CEO Change Suggests Strategy Shift: Street WrapThe incoming CEO, a two-decade auditing veteran who spent time with PriceWaterhouseCoopers, now takes up the task of reviving one of China’s largest and highest-profile public companies. JD’s results, the first from a major Chinese tech company for the March quarter, suggest the internet sector is making some headway in efforts to eke out top-line growth, but still struggling to regain momentum after years of punishing Covid Zero restrictions.JD’s performance was a far cry from the double-digit percentage expansions of previous years, before Beijing’s 2021 clampdown on internet spheres from online commerce to ride-hailing chilled a once-booming, free-wheeling tech sector.The 48-year-old outgoing CEO Xu, known for devising JD’s signature “6.18” sales bonanza, said in a statement he was quitting to devote more time to family. His successor becomes one of the few women chiefs of a major technology company, and emphasized in the same statement that Xu will remain involved with the company.Xu leaves behind a legacy that includes introducing the rival to Alibaba’s Nov. 11 Singles’ Day gala, pushing back against internal opposition to roll out the weeks-long equivalent event around the company’s June 18 anniversary. He also stepped up during the company’s low points — including an investigation into Liu over alleged rape in 2018 — by trimming the workforce and cutting units that weren’t contributing to growth.Read more: JD.com Shares Soar on Plan to List Two Units in Hong KongWhat Bloomberg Intelligence says:The unexpected retirement of JD.com’s 48-year-old CEO as it reported its first quarterly retail sales drop since 2019 suggests the e-commerce company faces heightened market-share challenges in China this year. This raises uncertainty about JD.com’s retail margin gains, which widened year-over-year in 1Q vs. the prior quarter to beat market expectations of lower profitability, through December.- Catherine Lim and Trini Tan, analystsClick here for the research.JD’s earnings gave investors a sense of what to expect when Tencent Holdings Ltd., Baidu Inc. and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. report results next week.Investors had bet that consumer spending and the tech sector would rebound as Beijing lifted years of sweeping restrictions that hobbled the world’s No. 2 economy. It expanded 4.5% in the first quarter of 2023, the fastest pace in a year, with economists expecting growth this quarter to accelerate. But economists have also pointed to slowing trade and other signs that the nascent recovery may be losing steam.JD is now spending on incentives to ward off intensifying competition from PDD as well as social media platforms such as ByteDance. It launched a 10 billion yuan discount campaign to capture new Chinese users in March even as it pulled away from Southeast Asian e-commerce, closing its Indonesian and Thailand e-commerce sites to try and shave costs elsewhere.Xu Lei stressed on a call with analysts that he would continue to support the company as the chairman of its advisory council, and lauded his successor for working alongside him in 2018 through JD’s “so-called darkest moment.”On the company’s discount programs, his successor said the strategy sought to offer consumers wider price ranges and product categories, in an adjustment to post-pandemic shopping patterns. “We are confident in our ability to control the overall costs of this program,” she said. “It has limited impact on our margins.”JD had avoided the worst of the years-long crackdown that hit Alibaba, which in March made the historic decision to split itself into six business units that could seek independent fundraising and listings.JD.com itself has spun off several units including JD Health International Inc., and is in the process of listing its property and industrials businesses in Hong Kong. It would remain the majority owner of both companies, which haven’t disclosed fundraising plans.--With assistance from Molly Schuetz.(Updates with executive’s comments from the third paragraph)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe Plot to Steal the Other Secret Inside a Can of Coca-ColaAI Drug Discovery Is a $50 Billion Opportunity for Big PharmaUS Airlines Are Sitting Out China’s Reopening‘Nearshoring’ Push Is Fueling Tech Job Demand in Latin AmericaVenezuela Brain Drain Enriches Panama and Other Neighbors©2023 Bloomberg L.P.","May 11, 2023 at 8:20 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jd-ceo-exits-helm-growth-121344261.html,Bloomberg,0.0,0.0,0.002144824872097599,0.3147323888232979,2023-05-11 08:20:00,2023-05-11 08:20:00,85.43000030517578,87.88999938964844,-2.4599990844726562

BABA,How to Boost Your Portfolio with Top Retail-Wholesale Stocks Set to Beat Earnings,"Two factors often determine stock prices in the long run: earnings and interest rates. Investors can't control the latter, but they can focus on a company's earnings results every quarter.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.DKS has an Earnings ESP figure of 4.43%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $3.32 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.18.Alibaba is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on May 18, 2023. BABA's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $1.35 a share seven days from its next earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Alibaba is $1.30, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 4.25%.DKS and BABA's positive ESP metrics may signal that a positive earnings surprise for both stocks is on the horizon.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

BABA,SoftBank Vision Fund Loses Money Again Despite Tech Rebound,"(Bloomberg) -- SoftBank Group Corp. lost money in its Vision Fund investment unit again despite a rebound in tech stocks, as the Japanese conglomerate suffered losses on unlisted startups in its portfolio.Most Read from BloombergJamie Dimon Says US Needs to 'Finish' the Bank CrisisTurkey Markets Rally as Candidate Withdraws Days Before VoteHedge Funds Drive Credit Suisse CDS Higher on Bets of a PayoutSteve Schwarzman Holds Off Giving Money to DeSantis After Meeting HimFamily Builds $900 Million Brazil Farming Empire After 935% GainThe Vision Fund unit lost ¥297.5 billion ($2 billion) in the three months ended March, compared with a ¥2.2 trillion loss a year earlier. The gargantuan investment fund that Masayoshi Son proudly set up in 2017 lost a record ¥4.3 trillion for the full fiscal year, almost doubling the record loss of ¥2.6 trillion the year before.While SoftBank has lost money off and on for years, the latest results are surprising because technology valuations around the world have largely rebounded this year. The Nasdaq 100 index, a benchmark for tech stock performance, rallied 20% during the March quarter, lifting share prices for some of SoftBank’s biggest investments.The South Korean e-commerce company Coupang Inc., for example, gained about 9%, while the Chinese ride-hailing company Didi Global Inc. rose about 20%. SoftBank accounts for such gains in its portfolio companies as profit on its income statement.But SoftBank marked down the value of its private companies far more than the increases in its public holdings. It lost about about $3.9 billion on its private portfolio during the quarter, while it gained about $1.9 billion with public companies.Amir Anvarzadeh, a market strategist at Asymmetric Advisors in Singapore, said that SoftBank may have marked down the value of private holdings to catch up to the overall market decline from earlier periods. “Unlisted names which account for something like 60% of its total investments had not been marked down more than 20%,” he wrote in a research note.Yoshimitsu Goto, SoftBank’s chief financial officer, led a conference call with investors following results, after Son said that he wanted to focus on an initial public offering for chip designer Arm Ltd. Goto acknowledged the past year has been very rough, and the tech investor was forced to mark down the valuations of almost 350 companies.“Total Defense,” he proclaimed in one slide about the fiscal year that just ended.SoftBank’s startup investments came to a screeching halt during the year, with Vision Fund investments falling more than 90% to just $3.14 billion. Goto explained that SoftBank has been careful to keep plenty of cash on hand to cover debt and other obligations, in part by selling off most of its holdings in Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.But Goto suggested that SoftBank may begin to invest more actively again. He said he meets with Son daily and he worries about whether Son has enough time to sleep because he is brimming with excitement about artificial intelligence, especially generative AI like ChatGPT. “My time has come,” Son has been saying, according to Goto.SoftBank won’t dive into investments right away, but it’s more open to possible deals than it has been in the past.“Last year, unless something unusual happened, we would rather have passed on opportunities,” Goto said. “But this year, if we’re comfortable, after checking every aspect, we want to take steps, one by one.”Analysts are skeptical about Son jumping back into deal-making mode too quickly. He may need to raise capital through Arm’s IPO before he starts spending money again.“If the Arm IPO happens at a decent valuation, then I don’t think it’s negative,” said Sharon Chen, credit analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “But if the company ramps up investments prior to the Arm IPO, that’s likely to be negative because this could weaken LTV.”Arm posted mixed results in the most recent quarter. Net sales rose 28% to ¥92.8 billion in the fourth fiscal quarter, compared with a year earlier. It lost ¥6.2 billion, though, after making ¥10.1 billion a year earlier. Currency rates had a significant effect on the results. Net sales in US dollars rose 12% to $696 million.SoftBank Earnings Put Arm IPO Plans, Startup Valuations in FocusBankers have pitched a valuation of between $30 billion to $70 billion for Arm’s listing, a wide range reflecting the challenges of valuing the firm against a backdrop of volatile semiconductor equity prices.“The Arm story is key and valuation is important, but that may be more at the mercy of markets than SoftBank would like,” said Mio Kato, an analyst from LightStream Research who publishes on Smartkarma.SoftBank offloaded an additional $7.3 billion in Alibaba shares this year through prepaid forward contracts, according to a Bloomberg analysis of regulatory filings. This may have reduced SoftBank’s Alibaba stock to around 3.8%. Goto said SoftBank still has the option to buy back the shares or close out the options.Last month, the Japanese conglomerate said it is selling its early-stage venture capital arm SoftBank Ventures Asia Corp. to an entity led by Taizo Son, the younger brother of Son. Terms of the deal weren’t disclosed.The sale of the startup incubator could ease SoftBank’s financing burden, while offloading Alibaba shares in the wake of the e-commerce leader’s plans to split into six parts would help maximize SoftBank’s divestment income, Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Marvin Lo wrote in a note last month.SoftBank is also nearing a deal to sell Fortress Investment Group to Mubadala for as much as $3 billion, the Financial Times reported, citing unidentified people briefed on the matter. Goto declined to comment on the topic.That would help SoftBank’s share price, said Victor Galliano, an independent analyst who publishes on Smartkarma. “The focus for now has to be realizing investments where possible and reducing leverage, and we look forward to perhaps more disclosure on Masa’s debts with the group.”Goto suggested that investors would hear from Son himself if SoftBank shifts back into offensive mode. The billionaire would want to deliver a clearer message if he starts hunting deals again.“It’s not that we’ll only invest in generative AI,” Goto says. “Anything AI-related, we’d like to consider. May not be too speedy, we’ll need to be selective.”--With assistance from Ayai Tomisawa and Vlad Savov.(Updates with CFO comments from seventh paragraph)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe Plot to Steal the Other Secret Inside a Can of Coca-ColaAI Drug Discovery Is a $50 Billion Opportunity for Big PharmaUS Airlines Are Sitting Out China’s Reopening‘Nearshoring’ Push Is Fueling Tech Job Demand in Latin AmericaWebtoons Are South Korea’s Latest Viral Cultural Export©2023 Bloomberg L.P.","May 11, 2023 at 5:12 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/softbank-vision-fund-loses-32-060536893.html,Bloomberg,-0.3,0.1,0.08236540664375716,0.44551382752413693,2023-05-11 05:12:00,2023-05-11 05:12:00,85.43000030517578,87.88999938964844,-2.4599990844726562
BABA,How quickly are China's ChatGPT-style services catching up with Microsoft-backed OpenAI?,"The popularity of artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot ChatGPT, launched by US firm OpenAI last November, has opened the floodgates to similar services in China, with many firms pledging to catch up or even outperform the American company in the world of Chinese language AI.Despite China's lack of access to the most advanced chips - the crucial requirement for training AI models - Chinese tech firms have enthusiastically jumped into generative AI development, but some experts have warned that the industry is anything from 18 months to three years behind ChatGPT.Voice and language recognition developer iFlyTek is the latest to publicly boast about its potential to outperform ChatGPT. Company chairman Liu Qingfeng said at a product launch on Saturday that iFlytek's own large language model (LLM) application, SparkDesk, would be able to surpass ChatGPT in the Chinese language world by October.As ChatGPT is not available in China and the central government is applying its strict censorship rules to generative AI content, the closed market has provided hope for local tech firms to stake their claim domestically.Alibaba owns the South China Morning Post.Meanwhile, the debate over whether China can catch up continues. Some generated images from Ernie Bot, which suggested that the system was simply translating Chinese into English for prompts, fanned discussion that Baidu had borrowed the core of ChatGPT, an allegation the company denied. OpenAI's generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) 3.5 model is the core technology behind the US start-up's chatbot.Alibaba's Damo Academy has a 100-strong team working on iterating and improving its LLM. Photo: Reuters alt=Alibaba's Damo Academy has a 100-strong team working on iterating and improving its LLM. Photo: Reuters>According to a leaked memo dated early April that cited an employee at Alibaba's research unit Damo Academy, Alibaba's Tongyi LLM is about 18 months behind OpenAI's GPT 3.5 model. Alibaba has neither confirmed nor denied the authenticity of the memo, which has circulated online.The memo also stated that the Damo Academy had assembled a 100-strong team to work on iterating and improving its LLM, which was initiated in January 2020 before being launched as Tongyi in September last year. Alibaba did not respond to a request for comment.ChatGPT has the capability to generate human-like responses to questions, and reached 100 million users in the first two months after its launch.Baidu founder and CEO Robin Li Yanhong told local media 36Kr in an interview late March that Ernie Bot was only about two months behind ChatGPT.Wang Xiaochuang, founder and ex-CEO of China's second-largest search engine Sogou, has publicly questioned Li's assessment, saying Ernie Bot lags ChatGPT ""definitely by more than two months"". Wang, who says his AI start-up Baichuan Zhineng will be launching the best Chinese LLM by year-end, has suggested that mainstream Chinese LLMs are about three years behind ChatGPT.Chinese tech companies were caught off guard by ChatGPT. Domestic AI champions SenseTime, Cloudwalk, Megvii and Yitu Technology have in recent years focused on applications such as computer vision and facial recognition, not development of LLMs.As OpenAI's Chinese rivals attempt to catch up to its GPT 3.5 model, the San Francisco-based company in March launched an improved GPT 4 version, which was hailed as the most advanced LLM to date due to its improved accuracy and enhanced ability to understand text, images and video prompts.Copyright (c) 2023.

BABA,SoftBank clocks smaller annual loss as Arm unit logs record sales,"Investing.com -- Japanese investment giant SoftBank Group Corp (TYO:9984) marked a second consecutive annual loss on Thursday amid a sustained decline in the value of its technology holdings, although the loss narrowed as its Arm unit logged record-high sales.SoftBank’s net loss attributable to shareholders was ¥970.14 billion ($1 = ¥134.21) in the year to March 31, 2023, compared to a loss of ¥1.708 trillion in the prior year.The smaller loss comes as the firm saw some improvement in the value of its publicly held equity over the past quarter, especially as bets on a pause in the Federal Reserve’s rate hike cycle and strong earnings spurred some gains in technology stocks.SoftBank’s chip designing unit Arm Ltd saw net sales rise 5.7% to a record high of ¥381.75B, on strong growth in royalty revenues. Arm is among the few bright spots in SoftBank’s holdings, with the unit’s proposed public listing presenting a potential capital injection for the Japanese firm.SoftBank’s flagship Vision Fund segment logged an investment loss of ¥5.322T, compared to a net loss on investments of ¥3.625T last year. The firm logged a small gain on exiting its stake in eight portfolio companies, mainly ride-hailing service Uber Technologies Inc (NYSE:UBER).This saw the carrying amount of investments in its Vision Fund fall by ¥4.419T to ¥10.489T at the end of the year.The firm has been offloading more of its stake in Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holdings Ltd (NYSE:BABA) to offset losses in its other investments. SoftBank saw an annual gain related to the settlement of prepaid forward contracts using Alibaba shares of ¥4.838T.But sales of its stakes in Alibaba saw SoftBank’s overall holdings in the firm fall below 20% over the year.Related ArticlesSoftBank clocks smaller annual loss as Arm unit logs record salesRussia fines Google over 'LGBT propaganda' and 'false information' - agenciesEuropean stocks trade higher ahead of Bank of England meeting","May 10, 2023 at 9:56 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/softbank-clocks-smaller-annual-loss-025604324.html,Investing.com,0.0,0.5,0.016711711711711714,0.37202702702702706,2023-05-10 21:56:00,2023-05-11 10:30:00,85.43000030517578,87.88999938964844,-2.4599990844726562

BABA,"Alibaba, JD.com Earnings Will Likely Give Stocks Little Help","(Bloomberg) -- As China’s post-Covid recovery loses steam, earnings are unlikely to provide the boost that the country’s tech stocks could really use.Most Read from BloombergTurkey Latest: Erdogan Says Unclear If Vote Will Go to RunoffTurkey Set for Runoff as Erdogan Falls Just Short of VictoryRemote Work Comes With Daytime Drug and Drinking HabitsChina Jails 78-Year-Old American for Life on Spying ChargesJD.com Inc. starts the reporting season on Thursday with analysts projecting less than 1% revenue growth for the first quarter, which would be the slowest pace on record, Bloomberg-compiled data show. Next week, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. will likely report a sub-3% sales increase, while Tencent Holdings Ltd. may still trail the double-digit pace of the past, according to estimates.The lackluster expectations are fueling traders to snap up bearish bets in the options market. The put-to-call ratio for Alibaba’s Hong Kong shares rose to the highest level since October, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Earnings consensus for members of the Hang Seng Tech Index has barely moved from record lows reached in March.Tech stocks have languished since hitting January peaks as China’s consumption-led rebound turned out to be more muted than expected. While upside surprise to earnings can help lift sentiment, the sector faces headwinds from amped up US-China tensions and high global interest rates, meaning a sustained rebound would be hard to come by.The market had “potentially gotten ahead of itself earlier in the year,” said Robert Lea, an analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence. “Internet stocks rallied in anticipation of better times to come, with hopes pinned on the potential upside from re-opening and more benign regulatory environment. However, this did not lead to a change in the earnings outlook for most companies.”Part of the issue is that spending after the country’s reopening hasn’t matched expectations. During the recent Golden Week holiday, booking volumes rose while spending remained lackluster. Investors are also worried about an uncertain economic outlook, especially after a surprise contraction in the manufacturing sector.There is some pick up in activity, though. Gross merchandise value growth in China’s e-commerce industry accelerated to 11% in March after slowing to 5% in the first two months this year, according to estimates by Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which cited recovering demand and easing logistics disruptions. Still, the broker says Alibaba and JD.com’s growth are below the industry average.Going forward, a return of risk appetite and material earnings upgrades are needed to spark the next leg of China’s tech rally, BI’s Lea said.Others caution that the market’s momentum has now shifted away from tech into more popular trades, including a recent frenzy on financial shares thanks to their links to the government.“The current earnings momentum is not very good and it will be hard to attract investors back to this sector when the other sectors like SOEs have much more attractive valuation and favorable policy support,” said Kenny Wen, head of investment strategy at KGI Asia Ltd.Tech Chart of the DayThe S&P 500 Information Technology sector is nearing record levels relative to its parent benchmark index.

This move lagged the S&P 500's daily loss of 0.46%. Elsewhere, the Dow lost 0.17%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 6.06%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the online retailer had lost 17.95% over the past month. This has lagged the Retail-Wholesale sector's gain of 0.44% and the S&P 500's gain of 0.85% in that time.Alibaba will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release, which is expected to be May 18, 2023. The company is expected to report EPS of $1.30, up 4% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $30.87 billion, down 4.1% from the year-ago period.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Alibaba. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

Alibaba is holding a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now.In terms of valuation, Alibaba is currently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 10.17. This valuation marks a discount compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 20.36.Also, we should mention that BABA has a PEG ratio of 0.8.

BABA,Alibaba Group Holding Limited (BABA) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,"Over the past month, shares of this online retailer have returned -18%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry, which Alibaba falls in, has lost 0.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Alibaba is expected to post earnings of $1.30 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +4%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -2.6%.The consensus earnings estimate of $7.85 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -5.5%. This estimate has changed -1.7% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.20 indicates a change of +4.4% from what Alibaba is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1.4%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Alibaba.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Alibaba, the consensus sales estimate of $30.87 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -4.1%. The $127.73 billion and $142.64 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -4.2% and +11.7%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryAlibaba reported revenues of $35.92 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -5.6%. EPS of $2.79 for the same period compares with $2.65 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $35.36 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.57%. The EPS surprise was +21.83%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Alibaba is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Alibaba. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Alibaba Group Holding Limited (BABA) : Free Stock Analysis ReportTo read this article on Zacks.com click here.Zacks Investment Research","May 9, 2023 at 8:00 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alibaba-group-holding-limited-baba-130001736.html,Zacks,-0.07142857142857142,0.14285714285714285,0.11095583160800553,0.4611456176673567,2023-05-09 08:00:00,2023-05-09 08:00:00,80.54499816894531,82.22000122070312,-1.6750030517578125
BABA,"Chip Sanctions' Effect on China's AI Advancement: Alibaba, Baidu, Huawei Look to Innovative Techniques","They are also researching ways to combine different types of chips to avoid counting on any one kind of hardware.OpenAI released ChatGPT a month after the chip sanctions came into force, triggering a global rage to develop generative AI.Alibaba and Baidu, which stashed A100s before the sanctions, have earmarked them for the most computationally intensive tasks.Nvidia created downgraded versions of its A800 and H800 chips for the Chinese market, called the A800 and H800, to bypass the sanctions.However, China's move is a costlier one. If a U.S. firm needs 1,000 H100s to train a large language model, a Chinese firm could need 3,000 or more H800s to achieve the same results, Yang You, a National University of Singapore professor. Experts also flagged the technical challenges of getting them to work reliably.Dylan Patel, the chief analyst at SemiAnalysis, told WSJ that Chinese researchers' pain points would only aggravate without access to the new Nvidia H100, which includes an extra performance-boosting feature especially helpful for training ChatGPT-like models.Photo by Body Stock and Dragon Claws via Shutterstock.© 2023 Benzinga.com.

BABA,Alibaba logistics arm eyes up to $2 billion Hong Kong IPO -sources,"By Scott Murdoch and Julie ZhuSYDNEY/HONG KONG (Reuters) -Alibaba's logistics arm aims to raise up to $2 billion via a listing in Hong Kong likely early next year, sources with knowledge of the matter said, bolstering hopes for a capital markets revival in the Asian financial hub.Cainiao Network Technology's initial public offering (IPO) plan comes after Alibaba flagged in late March it would split its business into six units and that most of them would explore capital raisings or market debuts to help fund future growth.Cainiao, which has started work on the IPO, is looking to raise between $1 billion and $2 billion in Hong Kong, according to three sources. They declined to be named because the listing deliberations are private.The planned IPO, the size of which has not been reported before, is likely to be launched in early 2024, two of the sources said.The sources cautioned that the plans are not finalised yet and remain subject to changes.Cainiao said it would not comment on market speculation.Alibaba did not respond to a request for comment.Alibaba, which acts as a massive online marketplace for buyers and sellers, has in past years picked up stakes in top express delivery players to ensure reliable services for the group.It co-founded Cainiao in 2013 with partners including department store owner Intime Group, conglomerate Fosun Group and a handful of logistic firms. Alibaba took control of Cainiao four years later and has lifted its stake to 67% from 47%.Cainiao, which provides software and shares data with warehouses, carriers and logistics firms, reported 42 billion yuan ($6.07 billion) in revenue in the nine months ended December, up 22% year-on-year and accounting for 6% of Alibaba's total revenue.The logistics arm's IPO plan is the first of the expected capital raisings for Alibaba's spun-off units to be reported publicly as it pursues the biggest restructuring in its 24-year history.Analysts have said that the breakup could ease scrutiny over Chinese billionaire Jack Ma's sprawling business empire, which has been a target of local regulators as part of a broader crackdown on private enterprises since late 2020.The other five units include Cloud Intelligence, Taobao Tmall Commerce, Local Services, Global Digital Commerce and Digital Media and Entertainment.IPO PROSPECTSDealmakers hope that Cainiao's potential IPO, expected to be followed by market debuts from some of the other Alibaba units in the near-term, could help revive sluggish fundraising activities in Hong Kong.While Alibaba has not divulged potential listing venues for the other units, bankers say that Hong Kong would be a preferred destination because of its proximity to the group's home market and Sino-U.S. tensions.About $1.5 billion has been raised from IPOs in Hong Kong so far this year, marginally above the $1.2 billion raised in the same period last year, according to Refinitiv data.Craig Coben, the former head of Bank of America's Asia-Pacific capital markets business, said the Alibaba spin-offs would be on the radar of major global investors.""There will be international demand for these assets, although valuation may be a challenge given the losses that global investors have suffered from high-growth Chinese stocks,"" he said.($1 = 6.9149 Chinese yuan renminbi)(Reporting by Scott Murdoch in Sydney and Julie Zhu in Hong Kong; Editing by Sumeet Chatterjee and Jamie Freed)","May 7, 2023 at 10:30 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alibaba-logistics-arm-eyes-2-033018024.html,Reuters,0.0,0.0,0.0004528985507246397,0.3003623188405797,2023-05-07 22:30:00,2023-05-08 10:30:00,83.62999725341797,83.30999755859375,0.31999969482421875

CRM,Billionaire Dan Loebs 2023 Portfolio: 10 Latest Stock Picks,"Since our engagement with Ms. Nash began, we have detected a pronounced aversion to including a shareholder representative on the Board. At the same time as we identified Ms. Brady, we proposed a fellow shareholder with impeccable credentials as a second candidate. This individual has years of public market experience, an exemplary record as a corporate director of a larger company, and a strong relationship with one of the top consumer investment companies in the world. Ms. Nash, who was presumably speaking on behalf of the Board, gave unconvincing explanations for rejecting this candidate.Shortly after rebuffing our candidate, and within a week of accepting Lucy Brady (though, oddly without recognizing our role in proposing her), yesterday, the Company hastily announced the appointment of Steve Voskuil to the Board. While we recognize Mr. Voskuil’s financial experience, this Board’s handpicked new director does not assuage our concerns about substantial corporate governance shortcomings. It is further concerning that the Board added a shareholder-identified candidate without being fully transparent about the process that led to her selection.It seems as if this Board is operating in triage mode rather than via best corporate governance practices. We fear the reason that the Board is reacting this way is because they (and others) have many reasons to close the curtain before shareholders can take a closer look at what transpired on their watch.Our Methodology To compile our list of Dan Loeb's latest stock picks, we look at the fund's latest filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and and picked the ten firms by investment in which Third Point had initiated new stakes in the first quarter.Third Point's Investment: $41.9 million Teck Resources Limited (NYSE:TECK) is a mining company that has operations in different countries all over the world.

CRM,Billionaire David Teppers 2023 Portfolio: Top 15 Stock Picks,"After a tumultuous 2022 and a start to 2023 that saw markets focus on whether the Federal Reserve would finally end its interest rate hiking cycle and if this would cause a recession, over the past couple of months a new complication has made its way into the financial markets. This is the U.S. debt ceiling, and it sits right at the heart of the American economy and by extension, the global economy. The debt ceiling is decided by Congress, and it serves as a check for the executive branch - or the Treasury Department under the President - to limit the amount of money that it can borrow to meet debt repayments.The back and forth between the president and Congress for this ceiling has often created turmoil in the financial market. In fact, this tussle also caused S&P Global Ratings to downgrade U.S. government debt to AA+ from AAA in 2011 - the first and only time in history that America received a downgrade which is often reserved for developing countries with fiscal mismanagement. The impact of this downgrade on the stock markets was immediate, with all major indexes declining by as much as seven percent in the aftermath.Our Methodology Appaloosa Management's Q1 2023 Investment: $31 million Tesla, Inc.

CRM,Roundhill Investments Launches Generative AI & Technology ETF (NYSE Arca: CHAT),"Unlike other technological megatrends, generative AI has already begun to have significant real-world impact. OpenAI's ChatGPT has become the fastest application ever to reach 100 million users*, and its customers are already integrating its technology to improve their everyday lives for everything from creative writing to coding software.Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence technology that uses neural networks to generate new data that is similar in structure and format to existing data. Unlike other AI techniques that use existing data to make predictions or classifications, generative AI can create entirely new data that is original and unique. This is accomplished through the use of complex algorithms that learn to recognize patterns and relationships within large datasets, allowing the AI system to generate new content or ideas that are similar in style or format.The Roundhill Generative AI ETF (CHAT) is an actively-managed ETF that is designed to provide exposure to companies around the globe involved in generative AI and related technologies.CHAT's top holdings at launch include: Nvidia (7.8% weight), Microsoft (7.6% weight), Alphabet (7.2% weight), Baidu (5.4% weight), iFLYTEK (5.0% weight), Adobe (4.9% weight), AMD (4.9% weight), SenseTime Group (4.7% weight), C3.ai (4.5% weight) and Salesforce (NYSE: CRM - 3.6% weight).About Roundhill Investments:The Fund expects to have concentrated (i.e., invest more than 25% of its net assets) investment exposure in one or more of the Technology Industries at any given time, which may vary over time. Further, the Fund expects to obtain such investment exposure by transacting primarily with a limited number of financial intermediaries conducting business in the same industry or group of related industries. As a result, the Fund is more vulnerable to adverse market, economic, regulatory, political or other developments affecting those industries or groups of related industries than a fund that invests its assets in a more diversified manner. The value of stocks of information technology companies and companies that rely heavily on technology is particularly vulnerable to rapid changes in technology product cycles. Please see the summary and full prospectuses for a more complete description of these and other risks of the Fund.CHAT is distributed by Foreside Fund Services, LLC.SOURCE Roundhill Investments","May 18, 2023 at 7:25 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/roundhill-investments-launches-generative-ai-122500708.html,PR Newswire,0.0,0.0,0.08846214760848907,0.46183085207475444,2023-05-18 07:25:00,2023-05-18 07:25:00,209.5,213.32000732421875,-3.82000732421875
CRM,Those who invested in Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) five years ago are up 63%,"Generally speaking the aim of active stock picking is to find companies that provide returns that are superior to the market average. And while active stock picking involves risks (and requires diversification) it can also provide excess returns. To wit, the Salesforce share price has climbed 63% in five years, easily topping the market return of 43% (ignoring dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 25% in the last year.Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business. See our latest analysis for Salesforce To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Salesforce's earnings per share are down 16% per year, despite strong share price performance over five years.Essentially, it doesn't seem likely that investors are focused on EPS. Since the change in EPS doesn't seem to correlate with the change in share price, it's worth taking a look at other metrics.In contrast revenue growth of 22% per year is probably viewed as evidence that Salesforce is growing, a real positive.

(CRM): Here is What You Need to Know,"Over the past month, shares of this customer-management software developer have returned +3.1%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -0.5% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Software industry, which Salesforce.com falls in, has gained 5.6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Salesforce.com is expected to post earnings of $1.61 per share, indicating a change of +64.3% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +1.2% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.11 points to a change of +35.7% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.76 indicates a change of +23.3% from what Salesforce.com is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.4%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Salesforce.com.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Salesforce.com, the consensus sales estimate of $8.17 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +10.2%. The $34.62 billion and $38.48 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +10.4% and +11.1%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistorySalesforce.com reported revenues of $8.38 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +14.4%. EPS of $1.68 for the same period compares with $0.84 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.99 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +4.99%. The EPS surprise was +24.44%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Salesforce.com is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Salesforce.com. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Salesforce Inc.

These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon.

CRM,Billionaire Ken Fishers Top 10 Stock Picks,"Our MethodologyFor this article we picked the top 10 stocks from Ken Fisher's hedge fund portfolio for the first quarter of 2023.Fisher Asset Management’s Holdings: $2,346,771,000 Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is the world's largest chip manufacturer.Like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is one of the top stock picks of billionaire Ken Fisher.“Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) contributed to performance as revenues grew +27% (in USD) from the year ago quarter. Despite this strength, the Company’s customers have seen near-term weakness in demand due to Covid-19 normalization as well as the launch timing of new products. However, the Company is well-positioned to continue a long-term growth trajectory because its leading-edge capacity is being absorbed by high-performance computing applications, particularly at nontraditional integrated circuit (IC) design houses, such as Apple, Alphabet and Amazon, which have become IC-design powerhouses over the past decade. Importantly, the Company’s aggressive investment in leading-edge equipment, tight development with fabless IC designers, and embrace of open development libraries, should continue to foster a superior competitive position and attractive long-term growth.”Fisher Asset Management’s Holdings: $2,478,511,000 The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) is a leading home improvement retailer with over 2,300 stores and a strong omnichannel network.Fisher Asset Management started building its position in The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) in the first quarter of 2012 and, in the first quarter of 2023, holds over 8.40 million shares in the company, valued at $2.49 billion. The company represents 1.5% of the hedge fund’s 13F portfolio.“The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) provided an update on reducing the environmental impact of its stores. Since 2010, the company has reduced U.S. store electricity use by 50% by implementing LED lighting across all of its stores, buying electricity from large-scale commercial solar farms, and installing rooftop solar farms. The company is now applying its experience to other parts of its operations, including reducing electricity use in its supply chain and water use in store irrigation. Home Depot was also recognized by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for being one of the nation’s largest green power users.”Fisher Asset Management’s Holdings: $2,579,321,000 Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is a semiconductor company that makes chips for various applications, including PCs, gaming, cloud services, and automotive.On May 3, Truist analyst William Stein increased Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)'s price target to $84 from $79, but maintained a ‘Hold’ rating on the stock. Despite the company's revenue exceeding expectations due to the upside in Gaming and Embedded segments, the analyst is concerned about AMD's weaker Q2 guidance and increasing investments in AI.Fisher's hedge fund also strengthened its position in Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) by buying 431,867 additional shares in Q1.“Last quarter we added Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) to the portfolio at 18x earnings and quickly made it into a top 5 position. At that time, Mr. Market was worried about earnings revisions for semiconductor stocks. In Q1 2023, it has been one of our best performing positions with the stock up 50%! In just three months, the market realized that Artificial Intelligence (AI) and related technologies require a lot of semiconductors. Mr. Market really is manic depressive but this volatility can give the enterprising investor just enough of a window to pick stocks with attractive risk rewards.”Fisher Asset Management’s Holdings: $2,798,969,000 Percentage of Fisher Asset Management’s Portfolio: 1.69%NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides graphics, compute, and networking solutions globally.Ken Fisher is also bullish on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) as of the end of the first quarter of 2023. His fund increased its holding in NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) by 1% in the first quarter, ending the period with over 10.08 million shares of the company.“NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a semiconductor mega-cap company and global leader in gaming cards and accelerated computing hardware and software. Shares of NVIDIA rose over 90% during the first quarter because of material developments in generative AI evidenced by the release of ChatGPT and other competitive models. On its fourth quarter fiscal 2023 earnings call on February 22, Colette Kress, NVIDIA’s CFO said, “AI adoption is at an inflection point.… The opportunity is significant and driving strong growth in data center that will accelerate through the year.” On the same call, Jensen Huang, NVIDIA’s CEO emphasized: “The accumulation of technology breakthroughs has brought AI to an inflection point. Generative AI’s versatility and capability has triggered a sense of urgency at enterprises around the world to develop and deploy AI strategies.… NVIDIA AI is essentially the operating system of AI systems today.… The activity around AI infrastructures…has just gone through the roof in the last 60 days. And so there’s no question that whatever our views [were] of this year as we enter[ed] this year has fairly dramatically changed as a result over the last 60, 90 days.” Indeed, our research indicates that shortages of NVIDIA GPUs3 are the biggest gating factor for AI adoption and that about 90% of AI-model training runs are performed on their GPUs. During its annual GTC conference4 in March, NVIDIA announced new products and services that expand its addressable market and together form a full AI computing platform. These included: (1) new AI training systems (where it is dominant) and inferencing systems (where the field is more wide open), such as specialized chips in the areas of large language models and recommender systems, simulation and graphics rendering, and video use cases; (2) new fully managed AI services in partnership with the major cloud service providers, called NVIDIA DGX Cloud and NVDIA Omniverse Cloud; (3) new domain-specific generative AI foundational models, branded NVIDIA AI Foundations, which NVIDIA customers can harness to build and train custom language models with their own proprietary data to develop differentiated offerings; and (4) industry-specific accelerator libraries, spanning such diverse verticals as genomics analysis and computational lithography. We continue to believe NVIDIA’s end-to-end AI platform and leading market share in gaming, data centers, and robotics (including automotive), along with the size of these markets, will enable the company to drive durable growth for years to come.”Fisher Asset Management’s Holdings: $2,801,441,000 Percentage of Fisher Asset Management’s Portfolio: 1.69%Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) provides global Customer Relationship Management (CRM) technology.Along with Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) is one of the top stocks on the radar of billionaire Ken Fisher.“Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) was a material contributor during the quarter. The company has taken numerous positive steps to increase profitability more quickly than expected. Salesforce also improved its corporate governance by recommending three new board members. The company is focused on improving margins, deemphasizing acquisitions, and has expanded its stock buyback plan from $10 billion to $20 billion. We believe Salesforce can pursue these opportunities while continuing to increase its competitive position.”  Suggested articles:12 Best Information Technology Services Stocks to Buy16 Most Profitable Value Stocks Now12 Best Household and Personal Care Stocks To Buy","May 14, 2023 at 6:15 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/billionaire-ken-fisher-top-10-231527952.html,Insider Monkey,0.5,0.5,0.193179788961039,0.45081980519480497,2023-05-14 18:15:00,2023-05-14 18:15:00,,,

CRM,3 Tech Titans Set to Break Out,"Tech Stocks Climb the Wall of WorryHowever, despite the fear-mongering from many investors and the underperformance in some regions of the market, tech has marched higher in a stair-stepping fashion thus far in 2023. Currently, it is in the process of breaking out.In early February, GOOGL shares tanked more than 10% after its AI chatbot Bard, made a mistake in its public-facing demo. While it was not a good look for the company or the stock, bargain hunters used the sell-off as an opportunity to accumulate shares. Last week, in a show of conviction, insiders scooped up a cool $20 million worth of the company’s stock. GOOGL is a mega-cap tech name that will essentially track the Q’s but should outperform to the upside over the next 6-12 months.Despite Oracle’s massive size, it is not talked about as much as stocks such as Microsoft or Amazon Oracle is not as “sexy” as these companies; however, it produces a ton of revenue and is a dominant player in its space. Furthermore, though Oracle has a beta of just 1 (the same volatility as the S&P 500 Index), it has outperformed 92% of stocks. Low volatility and high returns are the combination that makes for an excellent addition to any portfolio. Last week, Oracle broke out of a classic bull flag pattern on expanding volume.Beyond a resumption of strong growth, CRM is very attractive from a valuation perspective. CRM’s P/E ratio of ~37 is the lowest in at least ten years.Technically, the stock is consolidating in a bullish manner as it approaches its 50-day moving average for the first time since breaking out earlier this year. The first pullback to the 50-day moving average should offer investors a low-risk entry point and give them a chance to gain a cushion in the stock before it reports earnings at the end of the month.Amazon.com, Inc.

CRM,Here is What to Know Beyond Why Salesforce Inc. (CRM) is a Trending Stock,"Over the past month, shares of this customer-management software developer have returned -0.1%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -0.9% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Software industry, which Salesforce.com falls in, has gained 3.1%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Salesforce.com is expected to post earnings of $1.61 per share, indicating a change of +64.3% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +1.2% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.11 points to a change of +35.7% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.76 indicates a change of +23.3% from what Salesforce.com is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.4%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Salesforce.com is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Salesforce.com, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $8.17 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +10.2%. For the current and next fiscal years, $34.62 billion and $38.48 billion estimates indicate +10.4% and +11.1% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistorySalesforce.com reported revenues of $8.38 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +14.4%. EPS of $1.68 for the same period compares with $0.84 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.99 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +4.99%. The EPS surprise was +24.44%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Salesforce.com is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Salesforce.com. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Salesforce Inc.

The success it achieved during the pandemic establishes it as a fundamental necessity for corporate communication services even after pandemic restrictions are lifted.Zoom is reaping the rewards of shifts in personal communication. While mobile phone service remains indispensable, cloud-based video interactions may challenge conventional telecommunications companies in the future. As internet access broadens, maintaining connections could increasingly lean toward cloud software providers, sidelining traditional phone companies.However, there is one thing worth noting before investing in Zoom stock. Undoubtedly, the company enjoyed exemplary years during the pandemic. As a result, the markets also helped the stock flourish. But, as of press time, shares find themselves down almost 100% from their all-time high.A momentum slowdown may be worrisome, but it’s essential to consider the bigger picture. The pandemic demonstrated that remote work and maintaining productivity are feasible for many organizations. This bodes well for Zoom’s long-term prospects, making a valuation adjustment beneficial for investors.Faizan Farooque is a contributing author for InvestorPlace.com and numerous other financial sites.

(Operator Instructions) Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker, Helen Han, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.Helen HanOwen David ThomasDouglas T. LindeMichael E. LaBelleOperator(Operator Instructions) And I show our first question comes from the line of Steve Sakwa from Evercore ISI.Stephen Thomas SakwaDoug, I appreciate all the comments that you made on leasing. I did notice that there really was no, I guess, incremental leasing on the development pipeline outside of the 2 new projects that got added. So could you maybe just speak to the pipeline that you talked about, how much of that leasing that you're in discussions on is for the development? And I guess, how do you still feel about the projected yields on the development pipeline today?Douglas T. LindeOperatorNext question in the queue comes from the line of John Kim from BMO Capital Markets.John P. KimYou discussed extending some of your maturities on your JV mortgage debt and debt market overall, the mortgage market being inside bond pricing currently, which really goes against the grain of some of the issues we're hearing with the regional banks. I was wondering if you could just elaborate on how healthy that market is and who's willing to put more capital into office assets today.Michael E. LaBelleDouglas T. LindeOperatorAnd I show our next question comes from the line of Camille Bonnel from Bank of America.Jing Xian Tan BonnelFollowing up on the leasing pipeline, can you please comment on how you classify deals in the active proposal pipeline? And how this pipeline compared to last quarter or even a year ago?Douglas T. LindeOperatorAnd I show our next question comes from the line of Anthony Paolone from JPMorgan.Anthony PaoloneYes. So I appreciate all the color on capital markets and how you're trying to triangulate where pricing might be. But just for BXP for you to put capital out the door right now, what would you all want in terms of an IRR, how would you underwrite rents and cash flow growth? Like what would a deal that would prompt you to pull the trigger on look like?Owen David ThomasOperatorAnd I show our next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb from Piper Sandler.Alexander David GoldfarbOwen David ThomasAlex, we have access to capital, as Mike and I pointed out and the key is pricing. We're interested. We're open for business. We're interested in growing our company. We think we will. But that's -- that 9% look through cap rate is a guidepost for us.OperatorAnd I show our next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico from Scotiabank.Nicholas Philip YulicoDouglas T. LindeOperatorAnd I show our next question comes from the line of Blaine Heck from Wells Fargo.Blaine Matthew HeckDoug, your commentary around the most active tenant groups in the market was really helpful. Can you guys just talk about how you're taking advantage of that activity amongst medium and small financial and professional services companies. Are you breaking down any of your vacant spaces into smaller spec suites or doing anything else to accommodate that demand from small tenants?Douglas T. LindeSo the answer is we are, and we are seeing, I would say, very deliberate about the kinds of things we're doing. I'll let Bob talk, for example, about some of the activities we have going on in San Francisco right now, where what was put in front of me was a series of changes to some existing availability that we think will be very additive to the market. Bob, do you want to talk about our approach there?Robert E. PesterSure. We have a program of doing spec suites at Embarcadero Center on the smaller spaces, and we have several that are in the works right now. And some of them are designed, where they can be combined with other suites that we need larger space. And typically, when we do these turnkey, we might have to put a little bit of TI in after the fact when we find a tenant. But we've had great success with these smaller suites so far.Douglas T. LindeAnd Pete, maybe you can -- you or Ray can comment on the program we've had in Reston, Virginia for probably the last 7 years and how successful that's been.Peter V. OtteniOperatorAnd our next question comes from the line of Caitlin Burrows from Goldman Sachs.Caitlin BurrowsMaybe just another one on leasing. In the quarter, you did 660,000 square feet of leasing and have talked about now an expectation for about 750,000 square feet per quarter the rest of the year. So I was just wondering, are you seeing activity that specifically points to an increase in leasing activity in 2Q and beyond? And if so, what and kind of where is that? Or is it more of a general expectation at this point?Douglas T. LindeOperatorOur next question comes from the line of Michael Griffin from Citi.Michael Anderson GriffinMaybe we just shift back to San Francisco, down the Peninsula probably better off submarket, to be curious to get your thoughts about Google announcing the pause on that mega campus in San Jose. Could you see this being a potential benefit for that Platform 16 project? I think it's not expected to be stabilized til 2026. I know you have a relationship with Google. So any comments you can make there would be helpful.Douglas T. LindeSure. Bob, do you want to take that one?Robert E. PesterSure. First off, the CNBC report that came out the other day that they were stopping the project is false news. It's been reported by the mayor on Friday and Google yesterday that they're still planning on proceeding with the project today -- or excuse me, this year. We do have a relationship with Google, whether or not they would have interest in that project remains to be seen. But we will be the first building out of the ground adjacent to their campus. So time will tell. They're several years away from actually starting a building because they've got to put all the infrastructure in place person.OperatorAnd I show our next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra from Mizuho.Vikram L. MalhotraJust 2 quick ones. So one, can you just remind us, are there any risks sort of with your -- I think you have 3 or 4 rework leases in terms of just their performance and potentially being those being given back. And then just separately, broadly, I know you had embarked on -- over time, you've been investing CapEx to kind of keep the buildings fresh. And I'm just wondering sort of in this environment, can you remind us sort of what the sort of CapEx outlay may look like over this, call it, the next 2 years to keep the buildings competitive?Douglas T. LindeOperatorAnd I show our next question comes from the line of Ronald Kamdem from Morgan Stanley.Ronald KamdemDouglas T. LindeOwen David ThomasI would just add, we have -- Bob should comment on this. We have market inquiries relatively frequently for the Salesforce Tower, and it's completely full. And one of the reasons Salesforce is putting floors in the tower on the market is because it's actually the easiest space they have sublease given the attractiveness of the asset.Robert E. PesterYes. I would just add, the building is 100% leased. It's probably the most sought after building in San Francisco for space and we get multiple inquiries every month about people looking for space in the building.OperatorAnd I show our next question comes from the line of Dylan Burzinski from Green Street.Dylan Robert BurzinskiJust curious how you guys are thinking about buybacks or potential buybacks in the current environment. Owen, you mentioned the 9% implied cap rate that the stock now trades at today. And I realize that obviously, office transaction markets are fairly illiquid. But if you guys were able to get dispositions to the finish line, would you guys view buybacks the potential use of that capital?Owen David ThomasWell, we think that our stock represents a very uniquely interesting investment, particularly at this point in time. Most of the inquiries we've been getting recently, and that's the reason why Mike and I spent so much time on it in our remarks is our access to capital and how are we dealing with upcoming debt maturities and things like that. So in this kind of environment, buybacks are not a priority for us. And we also -- we have found interesting uses for the capital. We just put on our development pipeline this quarter. The 290 Binney Street development that's 100% leased to AstraZeneca and also the 300 Binney Street asset conversion.OperatorAnd I show our next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya from Credit Suisse.Omotayo Tejamude OkusanyaJust a quick one on office to resi conversion. Again, a lot of these buildings don't compete with your assets. So just curious how you guys think about that for movement? Is it something that you're excited about? Do you think it helps BXP longer term? Or just because it's not competitive product doesn't really matter to you guys?Owen David ThomasDouglas T. LindeYes. And this is Doug. I would just add that Worldgate is sort of an illustrative example of what we think may happen in certain instances in certain cities where the buildings have no intrinsic value as a repositioned conversion, and therefore, the land is really where the value is, and it probably has a higher and better use as residential. And so there are buildings probably that will be taken down and the sites will be then readapted as residential sites even though they're currently commercial office buildings.Helen HanWhy don't we circle back to Hilary on 360 Park? Hilary?Hilary J. SpannThanks, Helen. Can you guys hear me now?Owen David ThomasYes. Got it.Hilary J. SpannOperatorI'm showing no further questions in the queue. At this time, I would like to turn the call back over to Owen Thomas, CEO, for closing remarks.Owen David ThomasJust want to thank everyone for your time, attention and interest in BXP. That concludes the call.OperatorThank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for attending. You may all disconnect at this time.","April 27, 2023 at 3:53 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/q1-2023-boston-properties-inc-085338432.html,Thomson Reuters StreetEvents,0.0,0.0,0.13228382261995705,0.3875063661828368,2023-04-27 03:53:00,2023-04-27 03:53:00,194.1699981689453,195.94000244140625,-1.7700042724609375

CRM,Is Salesforce (CRM) a Resilient Stock to Invest in?,"Polen Focus Growth Strategy made the following comment about Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:While we have long admired Salesforce’s market leading enterprise software across several cloud offerings, we have also believed that the company’s cost structure was bloated. We applaud management’s decision to become a more streamlined and profitable business without sacrificing product development efforts, especially as we also continue to expect healthy revenue growth over the coming five years. The investment case for companies that have solid revenue growth along with disciplined expense management and strong capital allocation can often be, in our experience, a strong combination. And, if it also happens to include accelerating revenue growth and a highly attractive valuation, it can provide for unusually strong shareholder returns.

CRM,"Why Meta, Microsoft and Amazon stock have out-performed in 2023: Morning Brief","It's show time for big-tech names such as Amazon, Microsoft and Meta this week.But not in the way you think.Nothing to do with the release of ChatGPT28 out of Microsoft. No Reality Lab goggles out of Meta that will also help walk your adorable puppy by saying ""walk adorable puppy."" No new Alexa feature that will allow you to write a will while standing in line for a heart-pounding extra caffeinated coffee (or maybe...).My guy Ives is likely right on the favorable setup simply by looking at the deep cost cuts taken by scores of big tech names in under a year.Meta, for example, said last week it will layoff 10,000 people. That's on top of 11,000 layoffs enacted back in November 2022. Lyft said late Friday it will slash another 1,200 jobs. Last November, Lyft sent 13% of its workforce packing.These companies are among the likes of Microsoft and Salesforce laying off thousands of people as tech finds religion on expense management.More mass layoffs for the space are probably ahead, too.

CRM,Is Trending Stock Salesforce Inc. (CRM) a Buy Now?,"Over the past month, shares of this customer-management software developer have returned +4.7%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.3% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Software industry, which Salesforce.com falls in, has gained 4.6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Salesforce.com is expected to post earnings of $1.61 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +64.3%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.11 points to a change of +35.7% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.76 indicates a change of +23.3% from what Salesforce.com is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.5%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Salesforce.com is rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Salesforce.com, the consensus sales estimate of $8.17 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +10.2%. The $34.62 billion and $38.48 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +10.4% and +11.1%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistorySalesforce.com reported revenues of $8.38 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +14.4%. EPS of $1.68 for the same period compares with $0.84 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.99 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +4.99%. The EPS surprise was +24.44%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Salesforce.com is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Salesforce.com. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Salesforce Inc.

CRM,Top 15 Cloud Computing Companies in the World,"Net sales increased $21.4 billion in Q4, up 20% year-over-year and now representing an annualized sales run rate of more than $85 billion. Starting back in the middle of the third quarter of 2022, we saw our year-over-year growth rates slow as enterprises of all sizes evaluated ways to optimize their cloud spending in response to the tough macroeconomic conditions.As expected, these optimization efforts continued into the fourth quarter. Some of the key benefits of being in the cloud compared to managing your own data center are the ability to handle large demand swings and to optimize costs relatively quickly, especially during times of economic uncertainty. Our customers are looking for ways to save money, and we spend a lot of our time trying to help them do so. This customer focus is in our DNA and informs how we think about our customer relationships and how we will partner with them for the long term. As we look ahead, we expect these optimization efforts will continue to be a headwind to AWS growth in at least the next couple of quarters. So far in the first month of the year, AWS year-over-year revenue growth is in the mid-teens.That said, stepping back, our new customer pipeline remains healthy and robust, and there are many customers continuing to put plans in place to migrate to the cloud and commit to AWS over the long term.AI Generated ImageOur Methodology Latest Market Capitalization: $10.23 billion Samsara Inc.

CRM,Salesforce's New AI-Driven Workflow Tools: Raising Productivity Using AI,"The combination enables users to enter something in the plain text they want to accomplish, and the software will take care of the request for them similarly to ChatGPT, but in a business context.Salesforce is working on tools, including Einstein GPT for Flow, which combines this generative AI textual interaction to create a workflow with little or no code simply by typing an action a user wants the system to take. The other tool, Data Cloud for Flow, uses data-driven event triggers to drive actions in Flow.The underlying model is a blend of available models, including those from OpenAI, Google, and Meta and their models, and combining these with the Einstein intelligence layer the company has been working on since 2016, according to Doyle.The tooling will likely go into early beta release in June, with a final release in 2024.In March, Salesforce launched Einstein GPT to integrate OpenAI with Tableau, MuleSoft, and Slack..© 2023 Benzinga.com.

CRM,Salesforce Stock Looks Ready to Topple Technical Ceiling,"A historically bullish signal now flashing could help CRM topple that aforementioned ceiling and add to its 49.1% year-to-date lead. According to Schaeffer's Quantitative Analyst Rocky White, the equity's recent rally comes amid historically low implied volatility (IV), which has been a bullish combination for the shares in the past.White's data shows four other signals during the last five years when the security was trading within 2% of its 52-week high, while its Schaeffer's Volatility Index (SVI) sat in the 20th percentile of its annual range or lower. This is now the case with Salesforce stock's SVI of 26%, which sits in the 1st percentile of its annual range.One month after these signals, shares were higher 75% of the time, averaging a 4.6% pop. From its current perch, a move of similar magnitude would put CRM at $207.01 -- another one-year high.While the brokerage bunch is already optimistic toward CRM, there's still plenty of room for upgrades, which would generate  additional tailwinds. Of the 37 analysts in question, 13 still rate the security a ""hold"" or worse.","April 18, 2023 at 10:56 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/salesforce-stock-looks-ready-topple-155619997.html,Schaeffer&#39;s Investment Research,0.1,0.3,-0.008846153846153846,0.26397435897435895,2023-04-18 10:56:00,2023-04-18 10:56:00,199.0800018310547,198.5,0.5800018310546875
CRM,Corporate volunteerism: 'Not charity. It's good business.',"“A leader calling up the nonprofit saying, ‘Hey, I have 20 people that can be over there in an hour. What do you want them to do?’ That’s not helpful,” said Kari Niedfeldt-Thomas, managing director of corporate insights and engagement at Chief Executives for Corporate Purpose, which advises companies on sustainability and corporate responsibility issues.“What you want is for those volunteers to be part of an ongoing engagement, so those volunteers become embedded in the community,” she said. “They understand better what those participants needs are and they truly are then approaching their volunteerism work not as ‘I’m helping you,’’ but with a lens of ‘We’re in a partnership about making our community a better place.’ That levels the playing field. It doesn’t make it charity. It makes it a relationship.”It’s the kind of relationship that more and more corporations are trying to cultivate with their philanthropy.Tech giant Salesforce is a high-profile example of that connection, with its wide range of volunteer programs and funding initiatives that focus on education and workforce development, as well as climate and community resilience.Ron C. Smith, Salesforce’s vice president of philanthropy, said giving back has always been in the company’s DNA, along with innovation.“You have to be willing to hear what the community you live in — or the community you want to support — is asking for,” Smith said. “We start with the question ‘What can we do?’ or ‘How can we help?’ Then, we align to their strategic plans.”The company is part of the Pledge 1% movement, where corporations promise to donate 1% of their equity, time, products and profit. Salesforce often supports nonprofits through several of those donation types, often stacking them as its relationship with the group grows.Salesforce’s partnership with The Marcy Lab School, for example, began when some of its employees started volunteering at the New York nonprofit that trains high school graduates to become software engineers in one year at no cost to the students. Then, Salesforce started providing the school access to some of its software and is now looking at hiring some of the school’s graduates.Last year, The Marcy Lab School became one of the first grantees of Salesforce’s Catalyst Fund, which provided $100,000 to emerging nonprofits that were led by a person of color and had operating budgets under $2 million annually.Reuben Ogbonna, co-founder of The Marcy Lab School, said the Catalyst Fund allowed the nonprofit to nearly double its student body from 30 to 50. Students accepted at the school pay no tuition and receive a free laptop for their studies. Most graduates land jobs at top tech companies as software programmers, with starting salaries over $100,000.“What was most interesting about it was that they were making bets on organizations that typically don’t get on the radar of a big funder like Salesforce,” Ogbonna said. “And what I appreciated about Salesforce is that there was this acknowledgment that our organization already had the seeds of competitiveness and impact.”Ogbonna said Salesforce hasn’t exhibited the signs of doubt that other major funders have over whether an emerging nonprofit can handle a substantial donation properly. Instead, he says, Salesforce volunteers are helping make Marcy Lab School’s curriculum even stronger.Marcy Lab School’s other co-founder Maya Bhattacharjee said that its impressive 16,000 square-foot campus in an 11th-floor loft space in Brooklyn, New York’s Industry City neighborhood, with views of the Statue of Liberty across New York Harbor was “beyond our wildest dreams.”But their training program is exactly how they envisioned it. “I always dreamed of building a school that was just filled with a lot of love for students,” Bhattacharjee said. “Teachers are not thinking about students as numbers or test scores or things that needed to be fixed. To have educators around a table working to have programs work for every student is everything I dreamed of.”For Enmanuel de la Nuez Carvajal, getting accepted into Marcy Lab School was a dream come true as well. Like a lot of the recent high school graduates who apply to join Marcy Lab School, he felt like he was languishing at LaGuardia Community College. But not everyone was convinced.“Some of my friends were a little skeptical,” said the native of the Dominican Republic. “They said it sounds like it’s too good to be true. But I thought I don’t see how this could go wrong.”After graduating from Marcy Lab School in 2020, de la Nuez Carvajal was hired by the project management software company Asana, where he is currently a software engineer.Those are the kind of results that excite volunteers and keep them engaged to help their communities.Naomi Morenzoni, Salesforce’s vice president of philanthropy strategy, said the company is an outlier in terms of volunteering, with about 87% of its workforce donating time each year. According to Chief Executives for Corporate Purpose, the average volunteer participation rate through company-sponsored initiatives was 17% in 2022.“There’s a sea change that’s happened,” Morenzoni said. “We see that 50% of job seekers won’t take a job if a company doesn’t align with their values. All of that is driving value both for the company and for the community. The two are completely interconnected now.”Salesforce sees its philanthropy program – which provides employees seven days of paid leave to volunteer and a company match for donations up to a $5,000 total each year – as a tool for recruitment and retention.Morenzoni said Salesforce’s internal surveys show that 91% of its volunteering employees feel more engaged in their regular jobs.“This is good for us,” she said. “This is good for our communities. It’s not charity. It’s good business.”Though Salesforce declined comment on the investors’ complaints, officials said the company’s commitment to volunteerism will continue.“I can’t speak to what the investors are looking for,"" Smith said. ""But I know we’re going to continue doing the good work that Salesforce has committed to. And we’re going to make sure that we bring our employees and partners and everyone else along with us – including our investors – so they can see the good work that’s happening.” ____","April 18, 2023 at 5:20 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/corporate-volunteerism-not-charity-good-222029606.html,AP Finance,0.35,0.30000000000000004,0.21973851417399795,0.4450448655287364,2023-04-18 17:20:00,2023-04-18 17:20:00,199.0800018310547,198.5,0.5800018310546875

CRM,7 Stocks That Hedge Funds Are Dumping Now,"While it’s always important to conduct your own due diligence in the equities arena, there’s great value in understanding which hedge fund stocks to avoid. Put another way, these are the stocks that hedge funds are unloading, which should inspire additional research. Fundamentally, if the enterprises with the greatest access to information don’t believe in the impacted securities, you might not want to either.As well, another reason to carefully monitor stocks that hedge funds are bearish on centers on the folks these investment giants hire. Obviously, they don’t just pick up people randomly off the streets. Rather, we’re talking about some of the brightest, most educated minds on Wall Street. If they don’t like something, you should at least find out why. Again, it’s always important to do your own research first before making a major decision. With that said, the big dogs command a big influence. Therefore, watch out for these potential hedge fund sell-offs.VVisa$233.48MAMastercard$372.76CRMSalesforce$197.08JPMJPMorgan$139.83CICigna$258.67DHRDanaher$255.75ORLYO’Reilly Automotive897.28InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSource: ShutterstockIt’s not entirely clear why the big dogs apparently fell out of favor with Visa. Since the beginning of this year, V stock gained nearly 13% of its equity value. Overall, in the past 365 days, it’s up almost 10%. However, Visa’s viability depends on a robust consumer economy. Therefore, V may be one of the hedge fund stocks to avoid due to recession risks.Source: ShutterstockSource: ShutterstockAgain, it’s tough to discern exactly why CRM stands among the stocks that hedge funds are bearish on. Since the Jan. opener, CRM gained over 44% of equity value. In the trailing year, Salesforce now turns in a positive performance, up 4%. However, it’s possible that the institutional players believe the best is behind the company. Financially, Salesforce benefits from strong operations, particularly its three-year revenue growth rate of 16.1%. However, it does seem overvalued. Currently, the market prices CRM at a trailing multiple of 926.9.Source: ShutterstockLike the other stocks that hedge funds are unloading, JPM actually represents a decent performer. Since the Jan. opener, shares moved up almost 3%. In the past 365 days, they’ve gained 8% of equity value. However, the banking sector fallout didn’t do any favors regarding segment confidence. Therefore, it’s possible that the big dogs wanted to trim their exposure. Still, investors should note that JPM doesn’t necessarily strike as a need-to-dump enterprise. However, the market prices JPM at a forward multiple of 11.64, which rates as overvalued.Source: ShutterstockFrom the charts, it’s not surprising. Since the Jan. opener, CI gave up over 19% of its equity value. And in the trailing one-year period, CI barely pokes its head above water. Therefore, it seems like a future name among hedge fund sell-offs, particularly if mass layoffs continue. With accelerating pink-slip distributions, Cigna’s addressable market may decline. Troubles might be appearing on the financials. The company only features modest stability in the balance sheet. Further, its revenue growth and net margin print unremarkable stats.Source: ShutterstockWhile Danaher tends to be a steady performer, this year, it hasn’t been that impressive. Since the January opener, DHR slipped 4%. Over the past 365 days, the security lost nearly 9%. However, the volatility for DHR might be a case of trimming as opposed to an ominous indicator of hedge fund sell-offs. Financially, Danaher offers plenty of substance.Source: ShutterstockOn paper, ORLY stock doesn’t seem to deserve the title of stocks that hedge funds are bearish on. Since the January opener, ORLY gained more than 6% of its equity value.  In the trailing one-year period, it’s up nearly 24%. However, it’s quite possible that the top dogs don’t believe the underlying recessionary argument will hold up indefinitely.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

CRM,Wall Street Analysts Think Salesforce.com (CRM) Is a Good Investment: Is It?,"Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?Salesforce.com currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.81, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 37 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.81 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 37 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 22 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 59.5% and 5.4% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for CRMAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.ABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Is CRM Worth Investing In?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for Salesforce.com, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.1% over the past month to $7.11.Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for Salesforce.com.

CRM,Jeremy Grantham and Goldman Sachs Have One Thing in Common: They Both Like These 3 Stocks,"Market watchers are waiting for the day the Fed starts cutting rates, but those hoping such an act will signal the beginning of a bull market are in for a rude awakening. At least, that is the opinion of Jeremy Grantham.Across decades of investing, Grantham’s reputation has been built on predicating market meltdowns, and the legendary investor and GMO co-founder thinks the bear will only be halfway through its wrecking job once the Fed changes it inflation-combating strategy.“Most of the decline in these great bear markets only happens after the first interest rate cut,” Grantham recently said. “So you tell me when the first interest rate cut is, and I will tell you when the second half of the pain is going to start.”However, that doesn’t mean that Grantham has lost hope for all stocks. His portfolio still includes big bets on several names and he’s not the only one showing confidence in these equities. Banking giant Goldman Sachs has also been singing the praises of 3 Grantham-owned stocks, believing they are primed to push ahead from here. Let’s take a closer look.We’ll start with SolarEdge Technologies, the biggest supplier of photovoltaic inverters in the world. By creating a device that attaches to the back of the solar panel and increases the amount of power generated, the company essentially became the first to make power optimizers a commercially viable product, helping to reduce the cost of the energy the system creates.Given Europe is looking to become less dependent on Russian natural gas, the company is well setup up to cater to increasing demand in the region, which now accounts for nearly 60% of its total solar inverter volume.Grantham obviously thinks SolarEdge has what it takes to outfox the bear. In Q4, GMO increased its position by 59% and holds a total of 657,660 SEDG shares. These are currently worth $189.6 million.Mirroring Grantham’s confidence, Goldman Sachs analyst Brian Lee believes the future is bright for this smart energy leader. He writes: “SEDG’s gross margin recovery story is still only in the middle innings with more drivers of upside yet to fully play out (e.g. freight, Sella 2 manufacturing, IRA credits), while the specter of potential upside and leverage to any further European policy support (e.g. IRA) would make SEDG well-positioned to see further upside in numbers, in our view. At the same time, the Euro could prove to be a tailwind again in the near-term.”The next name endorsed by Grantham and Goldman is another leader in its field. Salesforce is a software colossus, specializing in customer relationship management (CRM). Its software and apps provide its client base with the means to offer their own clientele a higher level of service.The offerings focus on sales, analytics, and automation to bespoke customer service, community management, and relationship intelligence, amongst others. The company touts itself as the world’s premier CRM platform for businesses, and with a market cap over $192 billion, that’s no idle boast.That must all be very pleasing to Grantham. GMO’s stake in Salesforce stands at 1,385,522 shares, currently worth $265.3 million.For Goldman Sachs analyst Kash Rangan, when considering this tech giant’s future, there’s plenty to be upbeat about.“We reiterate the company’s impressive organic growth rate given the company’s size at +$30bn estimated revenues (GSe) in FY23,” Rangan said. “We remain bullish on the company’s ability to drive continued y/y operating margin expansion beyond FY23. We would point out that companies such as Microsoft, Adobe, Intuit and Autodesk which embarked on a journey towards improving OM all benefited from their valuation multiples getting re-rated significantly higher on an EV/Sales basis. We think CRM could join this list especially as the company grows into a formidable $50 billion business in F26/C25, benefiting from a much lower starting point for OM relative to other companies, which on the flip side also offers plenty of room for improvement.”Last but not least on our Grantham-Goldman backed list, we have Carrier Global, a company formed way back in 1915 as a specialist in the making and distribution of HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) systems.While Carrier is most famous for its residential and commercial air conditioners, its remit has expanded since its early days and now includes the manufacturing of commercial refrigeration and food service equipment, while the company is also an expert in fire and security technologies.For the most part, over the past couple of years, Carrier has managed to beat bottom-line expectations, and while it did not manage to do so in the most recent quarterly update, for 4Q22, at $0.40, adj. EPS still met the analysts’ forecast. Likewise at the top-line; the company might have seen revenue drop by 1% year-over-year to $5.1 billion, but that figure edged ahead of the consensus estimate by $30 million. Looking ahead to the full year 2023, the company guided for sales of $22 billion, also improving on Wall Street’s $20.39 billion forecast, while adj. EPS is expected in the range between $2.50 and $2.60 – at the mid-point, the same as consensus at $2.55.Jeremy Grantham is clearly upbeat about Carrier. His GMO fund currently owns 1,138,546 shares worth $49.55 million.When assessing Carrier’s prospects, Goldman Sachs analyst Joe Ritchie thinks the company is playing it safe with regards to its outlook. He writes, “Improving price/cost, ongoing cost savings, and continued strength in Commercial HVAC suggest EPS guide is likely conservative, and we remain bullish on the company in the long-term given the self-help opportunity coupled with strong growth tailwinds from education stimulus, healthy building orders, and heat pump demand.”Disclaimer: The opinions expressed in this article are solely those of the featured analyst.

CRM,Salesforce Inc. (CRM) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,"Shares of this customer-management software developer have returned +9.1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +6.5% change. The Zacks Computer - Software industry, to which Salesforce.com belongs, has gained 14.3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Salesforce.com is expected to post earnings of $1.61 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +64.3%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.1%.The consensus earnings estimate of $7.11 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +35.7%. This estimate has changed +0.1% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.80 indicates a change of +23.7% from what Salesforce.com is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.5%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for Salesforce.com.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Salesforce.com, the consensus sales estimate of $8.17 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +10.2%. The $34.62 billion and $38.48 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +10.4% and +11.1%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistorySalesforce.com reported revenues of $8.38 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +14.4%. EPS of $1.68 for the same period compares with $0.84 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.99 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +4.99%. The EPS surprise was +24.44%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Salesforce.com is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Salesforce.com.

Nevertheless, it still posted a 20% increase on a year-over-year basis in sales, contributing $21.4 billion to its overall revenue base.Over the long term, research firms such as Redburn believe the division could be a stand-alone entity with a valuation of over $3 trillion.

CRM,3 Super Speculative Tech Stocks That Could Make You Very Rich,"As a result, the time is ripe to look at speculative tech stocks again in the hopes of picking a winner.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOver the past ten years, brief underperformance in the technology sector has consistently presented lucrative buying opportunities in the long run. Currently, tech stocks have again shifted towards outperformance, as observed in 2023.So, with the right research, investors stand to make a lot of money from investing in the best speculative tech stocks out there. Keeping this in mind, here are three speculative tech stocks to buy that are worth considering:Source: Muh.Imron / Shutterstock.comSea, a conglomerate headquartered in Singapore, operates three key businesses: digital entertainment, e-commerce (which includes digital payments), and financial services. The primary reason for Sea’s appeal as a tech stock investment lies in its potential for market expansion opportunities.The focus of the tech conglomerate is Southeast Asia. The company’s three key business lines are doing exceptionally well in the region. Shopee is the largest e-commerce platform in Southeast Asia, SeaMoney is considered Sea’s payments arm, and Garena distributes game titles across Southeast Asian countries and Taiwan.At the same time, it is also delivering on key metrics. Sea reported revenue of $3.45 billion in the quarter that ended December 2022, up 7% year on year, and a net income of $426.8 million, up 169% year on year. The company’s operating income saw a significant boost of 218% to $520.53 million. It was the fourth quarter in a row that the e-commerce company outperformed analyst estimates.All things considered, the growth story is far from over for this one. That makes Sea one of the best speculative tech stocks out there.Source: Tada Images / Shutterstock.comWhile this move comes as the company starts to reduce its recruitment drive initiated during the early stages of the pandemic, it is not the sole reason to invest in the company.A more comprehensive understanding of the organization’s strategy, performance, and long-term prospects should be considered when making investment decisions. Despite the layoffs, there are plenty of fundamental reasons why Salesforce is moving in the right direction.Salesforce is taking steps in the right direction by decreasing costs and positioning itself for future growth. Its strategic plans, including downsizing its office space footprint and implementing more hybrid work policies, show its commitment to increasing efficiency and agility while remaining competitive in the software industry.However, it’s important to note that Salesforce’s high valuation compared to its peers may deter value investors. The current price-to-earnings ratio of 916.9 times is significantly higher than the industry median of 27.20, making it a potentially risky investment. If market sentiment towards the company changes, it could lead to pullbacks in the stock price.Source: Tattoboo / ShutterstockThey are concerned that Adobe’s dominance in the creativity software would gain an unfair advantage. Figma’s breakneck growth suggests it could become a much larger piece of Adobe’s pie and significantly boost its long-term revenue growth, even though it accounts for only about 2% of Adobe’s fiscal 2022 revenue.Despite regulatory concerns about its proposed acquisition of Figma, Adobe’s Digital Media segment, which includes its Creative Cloud services, continues to perform well.Overall, Adobe is in a good position whether the mega-deal goes through or not. If you are researching speculative tech stocks, ADBE is a reasonable pick. The fact that the stock is down over 15% over the last 12 months only adds to its appeal.Faizan Farooque is a contributing author for InvestorPlace.com and numerous other financial sites.

That’s just injecting some fundamental uncertainty into the whole space, and given the valuations and popularity of the AI names, it’s resulting in some wild gyrations!""

CRM,"If You Invested $1000 in Salesforce.com a Decade Ago, This is How Much It'd Be Worth Now","How much a stock's price changes over time is important for most investors, since price performance can both impact your investment portfolio and help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.Another factor that can influence investors is FOMO, or the fear of missing out, especially with tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.What if you'd invested in Salesforce.com (CRM) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to CRM for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?Salesforce.com's Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at Salesforce.com's main business drivers.Headquartered in San Francisco, Salesforce, Inc., founded in 1999, is the leading provider of on-demand Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software, which enables organizations to better manage critical operations, such as sales force automation, customer service and support, marketing automation, document management, analytics and custom application development.Salesforce is currently the largest CRM vendor in the world with a market share of nearly 20% according to reports of Gartner, a global research and advisory firm. Its nearest rival, SAP is way behind at a market share of around 8%.  About 90% of the Fortune 100 companies uses at least one Salesforce software.The company has leveraged its expertise in on-demand software to increase the scale of operations. It also offers a technology platform for customers and developers to build and run business applications.Salesforce helps companies of every size and industry to connect with their customers in new ways through existing and emerging technologies including cloud, mobile, social, IoT and artificial intelligence (AI).Rapid digital transformation and the company’s sustained focus on introducing more aligned products as per customer needs is driving its revenues higher. Over the last eight years, Salesforce’s annual revenues have sextuple from $5.4 billion in fiscal 2015 to $31.4 billion in fiscal 2023.There are two main revenue streams — Subscription and Support and Professional Services & Other.Subscription revenues comprise subscription fees from customers, accessing the company’s enterprise cloud computing services (Cloud Services), software licenses and subscription fees recognized from customers for additional support beyond the standard support lent by the company. This segment accounted for more than 93% of Salesforce’s fiscal 2023 revenues.Professional Services & Other revenues consist of fees that the company derives from consulting and implementation services and training. This segment accounted for the remaining 7% of Salesforce’s fiscal 2023 revenues.Bottom LineAnyone can invest, but building a successful investment portfolio requires research, patience, and a little bit of risk. So, if you had invested in Salesforce.com ten years ago, you're likely feeling pretty good about your investment today.A $1000 investment made in April 2013 would be worth $4,468.55, or a 346.86% gain, as of April 3, 2023, according to our calculations. Investors should note that this return excludes dividends but includes price increases.In comparison, the S&P 500 gained 161.87% and the price of gold went up 21.56% over the same time frame.Analysts are anticipating more upside for CRM.Salesforce is benefiting from a robust demand environment as customers are undergoing a major digital transformation. The rapid adoption of its cloud-based solutions is driving demand for its products. Its sustained focus on introducing more aligned products as per customer needs is driving its top-line. Continued deal wins in the international market is another growth driver. The acquisition of Slack would position the company to be a leader in enterprise team collaboration solution space and better compete with Microsoft’s Teams product. We expect CRM revenues to grow at a CAGR of 11.2% through fiscal 2024-2026. However, stiff competition and unfavorable currency fluctuations are concerns. Besides, challenging macroeconomic environment might hurt its growth prospects In the near-term.The stock has jumped 7.16% over the past four weeks. Additionally, no earnings estimate has gone lower in the past two months, compared to 19 higher, for fiscal 2023; the consensus estimate has moved up as well.Salesforce Inc.

CRM,"HubSpot - Great Service, Bad Price","HubSpot (NYSE:HUBS) is a leading software company that offers a suite of products for inbound marketing, sales and customer service. Founded in 2006 by Brian Halligan and Dharmesh Shah, the company's primary product is the HubSpot Growth Platform, an all-in-one solution that combines these distinct channels and more. The company uses ""freemium"" tactics to drive customer growth, which was 24% year over year in 2022. HubSpot now has over 167,000 customers, with 8,400 customers added in the fourth quarter.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with HUBS. Click here to check it out. HUBS 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of HUBSPeter Lynch Chart of HUBSBusiness model breakdownHubSpot's product offerings can be broken down as follows:Marketing Hub: This includes tools for content management, search engine optimization (SEO), email marketing, social media marketing, analytics and more. It helps businesses create and promote engaging content to attract leads and convert them into customers.Sales Hub: This offers tools for managing contacts, tracking deals, automating sales processes and forecasting revenue. It helps sales teams close deals faster and more efficiently.Service Hub: This provides tools for managing customer support, tracking and resolving issues and building customer loyalty. It helps businesses provide exceptional customer service, turning satisfied customers into advocates for the brand.CMS Hub: This is a content management system that allows businesses to create and manage their websites easily. It offers a range of customizable templates, responsive design and built-in SEO tools.Operations Hub: This tool helps businesses synchronize, clean and maintain their data across different systems, ensuring that all teams are working with accurate and up-to-date information.It operates a Cloud software business model, which is among the best business models for profitability. It is generally able to automate much of the customer touchpoints and onboarding to scale. Costs are relatively fixed and the margins are incredible.Many companies choose to sacrifice short-term profits by maximizing sales and marketing spend. It's a luxury that subscription models can afford better than other models, considering the premium investors are willing to pay for revenue growth and the promise of future profits.The crucial aspect of HubSpot's strategy is targeting the small- and medium-sized business (SMB) segment, where it can customize offerings to cater to businesses of specific sizes. By providing free tiers and scalable pricing options based on feature requirements, HubSpot ensures a smooth onboarding experience and a comprehensive suite of tools that serve as a nearly all-in-one solution.HubSpot has become the go-to option for many SMBs, which have often been overlooked by cloud software providers. The company's ability to consistently develop and deliver high-quality additional features enables a land-and-expand approach, which serves as a key competitive advantage for HubSpot. 98% of HubSpot's revenue comes from subscription services, which are very sticky. Companies are pushing more on soft marketing and utilizing social media to attract customers, rather than relying on direct sales. As a result, HubSpot's share of the overall CRM market could continue to expand.FinancialsFor a company that has been around since 2006, it should be profitable at this point. Yet, despite enjoying gross margins of 82%, HubSpot has decided to spend a large chunk of its profits on research and development. In 2013, the company had $15 million in R&D expenses on $50 million in gross profit. Not much seems to have actually changed in the product since then, but the R&D expense has risen to $422 million. This expense puts the company considerably in the red, taking up nearly 30% of its operating expenses. By comparison, industry leader Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) only spends 21% on R&D.Some metrics are not so great for a technology company. HubSpot, like many of these SaaS operations, needs a lot of people to function properly. It has over 7,000 employees and generates around $235,000 in revenue per employee. In comparison, Salesforce gets over $390,000 in sales per employee.The company also needs to address the issues surrounding stock-based compensation dragging down profitability as well. I think it spends way too much to compensate its top executives considering the company's continued lack of profitability.That being said, 2023 is all about artificial intelligence, and OpenAI's GPT platform may allow HubSpot to drive more revenue per employee. I hope the company decides to tap into AI as a source of growth, as I believe this could help a lot. Only time will tell whether or not the company can utilize it well.ValuationHistorically, it has been a bad idea to bet against the technology industry as a whole. However, that alone does not make HubSpot worth owning, as the tech industry has more duds than winners.HubSpot is currently experiencing a rather dramatic slowdown. The company anticipates $2.05 billion to $2.06 billion in revenue for 2023, which equates to nearly 19% year over year growth. This comes after 33% growth during 2022 and 47% revenue growth in 2021. At this rate, it would take another 16 years to reach the level Salesforce is at today.Of course, the stock's current multiples are based on an incredible growth rate achieved in the last five years, which is slowing considerably. Thus, I think it is likely only a matter of time before the market re-adjusts HubSpot's value lower.","March 31, 2023 at 10:21 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hubspot-great-bad-price-162118760.html,GuruFocus.com,0.0500000000000001,0.7083333333333333,0.17020055770055767,0.4358966108966108,2023-03-31 10:21:00,2023-03-31 10:21:00,197.4900054931641,199.77999877929688,-2.289993286132784

CRM,Why You Should Avoid Overvalued and Overhyped CRM Stock (For Now),"Yet, any stock can be vulnerable to pullbacks, especially after a huge run-up. Before investing in Salesforce, consider the risk-versus-reward profile, as a substantially smaller company might not be able to live up to its own high expectations.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsCRM stock jumped from $165 to nearly $190 after the earnings and guidance release. Now, Salesforce has the daunting task of justifying the hype and meeting its own revenue expectations. That’s going to be challenging during a time when some businesses are cutting costs due to elevated inflation and recession fears.Alarmingly, Salesforce’s workforce increased 62% during that hype-fueled time. Now, in 2023, the company is laying off 10% of its staff. It certainly won’t be easy for a significantly smaller Salesforce to live up to its pumped-up revenue expectations.Another concern is the valuation of CRM stock. The aforementioned post-earnings share-price rally made the stock even more expensive than it already was.Meanwhile, Salesforce’s TTM price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 6.01x is more than double the sector median P/S ratio of 2.68x. In addition, Salesforce’s TTM price-to-cash-flow (P/CF) ratio is 26.73x, versus the sector median P/CF ratio of 19.79x.Given the company’s sky-high P/E ratio, it’s sensible to wait for the Salesforce share price to move closer to its 52-week low of $126.34 before taking a position. Otherwise, you might end up on the wrong side of the trade.Besides, Salesforce has to knock it out of the park with stellar revenue stats over the coming year. This will be difficult to achieve with a reduced staff. So, now isn’t the right time to buy CRM stock, as lower prices are likely on the horizon.David Moadel has provided compelling content – and crossed the occasional line – on behalf of Motley Fool, Crush the Street, Market Realist, TalkMarkets, TipRanks, Benzinga, and (of course) InvestorPlace.com.

CRM,Why Is Salesforce.com (CRM) Up 5.4% Since Last Earnings Report?,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Salesforce.com (CRM). Shares have added about 5.4% in that time frame, outperforming the S&P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Salesforce.com due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Salesforce reported better-than-expected financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. The company’s fourth-quarter non-GAAP earnings doubled to $1.68 per share from the 84 cents reported in the year-ago quarter. The figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.36.The quarterly non-GAAP earnings included a loss of 25 cents per share from the mark-to-mark accounting of CRM’s strategic investments at a non-GAAP tax rate of 22%. However, the company’s ongoing restructuring initiative, which includes trimming the workforce, benefited fourth-quarter non-GAAP earnings by 9 cents per share.Salesforce’s quarterly revenues of $8.38 billion climbed 14% year over year, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.99 billion. The top line also improved 17% in constant currency (cc).The company has been benefiting from the robust demand environment as customers are undergoing a major digital transformation. Thus, the rapid adoption of its cloud-based solutions resulted in the better-than-anticipated performance in the fiscal fourth quarter.Coming to CRM’s business segments, revenues from Subscription and Support (93% of the total revenues) increased 14.1% from the year-earlier period to $7.79 billion. Professional Services and Other (7% of total sales) revenues climbed 19.5% to $595 million.Under the Subscription and Support segment, Sales Cloud revenues grew 13% year over year to $1.8 billion. Revenues from Service Cloud, one of the company’s largest and fastest-growing businesses, also improved 13% to $1.9 billion.Marketing & Commerce Cloud revenues jumped 13% to $1.2 billion. Salesforce Platform and Other revenues were up 15% to $1.6 billion. Also, revenues from Data increased 18% year over year to $1.3 billion.Geographically, Salesforce registered revenue growth of 14% in America (67.5% of the total revenues), 30% in the Asia Pacific (9.4%) and 20% in the EMEA (23.1%) on a year-over-year basis.Salesforce’s gross profit came in at $6.28 billion, up 18.3% from the prior-year period. Moreover, the gross margin improved 200 basis points (bps) to 75%.Salesforce recorded a non-GAAP operating income of $2.45 billion, up 123.3% from the year-ago quarter’s level of $1.1 billion. Moreover, the non-GAAP operating margin expanded 1,420 bps to 29.2% from 15% in the year-ago quarter due to lower operating expenses as a percentage of total sales. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenues declined to 71% from 75% in the year-ago quarter.Salesforce exited the fiscal fourth quarter with cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $12.5 billion, up from the $11.9 billion recorded at the end of the previous quarter.CRM generated operating cash flow of $2.79 billion and free cash flow of $2.57 billion in the fourth quarter. In fiscal 2023, the company generated operating and free cash flows of $7.11 billion and $6.31 billion, respectively.As of Jan 31, 2023, the current remaining performance obligation reflecting revenues under contract for the next 12 months was $24.6 billion, up 12% on a year-over-year basis. In the fourth quarter and full fiscal 2023, the company bought back shares worth $2.32 billion and $4 billion, respectively.Concurrent with its fourth-quarter results, Salesforce announces the expansion of its ongoing share repurchase program to $20 billion from the initial announcement of $10 billion made in 2022. With the total fiscal 2023 buyback of $4 billion, the company has now $16 billion remaining under its current authorization limit.Salesforce provided strong guidance for the first quarter and fiscal 2024. For the fiscal first quarter, Salesforce projects total sales between $8.16 billion and $8.18 billion (midpoint $8.17 billion).The revenue guidance includes a $150-million negative impact of unfavorable currency exchange rates. Furthermore, CRM anticipates non-GAAP earnings per share in the band of $1.60-$1.61 for the current quarter.For fiscal 2024, Salesforce forecasts revenues in the range of $34.5-$34.7 billion. The company expects no impact from foreign currency exchange rates.The company projects fiscal 2024 non-GAAP earnings between $7.12 and $7.14 per share. Salesforce estimates a non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 27% for the fiscal and expects a year-over-year increase in operating cash flow in the 15 range.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates.The consensus estimate has shifted 61.49% due to these changes.VGM ScoresCurrently, Salesforce.com has a nice Growth Score of B, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with an F. Following the exact same course, the stock was allocated a grade of F on the value side, putting it in the lowest quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of D. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookEstimates have been trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. It comes with little surprise Salesforce.com has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). We expect an above average return from the stock in the next few months.Performance of an Industry PlayerSalesforce.com is part of the Zacks Computer - Software industry.

CRM,Salesforce.com (CRM) Is Considered a Good Investment by Brokers: Is That True?,"The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?Salesforce.com currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.81, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 37 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.81 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 37 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 22 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 59.5% and 5.4% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for CRMAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.ABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Should You Invest in CRM?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for Salesforce.com, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 56% over the past month to $7.11.Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for Salesforce.com.

CRM,Salesforce Inc. (CRM) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,"Over the past month, shares of this customer-management software developer have returned +5.4%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +2.3% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Software industry, which Salesforce.com falls in, has gained 12.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Salesforce.com is expected to post earnings of $1.61 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +64.3%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +61.5%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.11 points to a change of +35.7% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +55.6%.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.80 indicates a change of +23.7% from what Salesforce.com is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +26.1%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Salesforce.com is rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Salesforce.com, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $8.17 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +10.2%. For the current and next fiscal years, $34.62 billion and $38.48 billion estimates indicate +10.4% and +11.1% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistorySalesforce.com reported revenues of $8.38 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +14.4%. EPS of $1.68 for the same period compares with $0.84 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.99 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +4.99%. The EPS surprise was +24.44%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Salesforce.com is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Salesforce.com.

CRM,"Marc Benioff says he can juggle empathy, cost cuts, and layoffs as he doubles down on efficiency at Salesforce","“I’m willing to take the bullets and the cuts and the vilification,” Benioff, 58, tells me during a wide-ranging interview that took place via phone while he was on a flight to the East Coast. “That’s what you have to do as CEO, especially through difficult times.”“It’s much harder when things are contracting than when things are expanding,” Benioff says of bringing people into his view of the world and business’s role in it.Indeed, Benioff now finds himself having to listen to—and prove that he can answer—stakeholders with all sorts of new demands. His ability to navigate these loud voices, from employees asking for more flexible work-at-home policies to shareholders agitating for leaner operations, will prove to be a useful case study not just in Benioff’s style of “empathetic” leadership. In many ways, it could also serve as a referendum on the whole model of stakeholder capitalism.“It [layoffs] is something that you never want to have to do, but everybody knows you have to do it, because it’s just the nature of business,” says Benioff, and then quickly adds: “But that doesn’t mean that you can’t have a great company, and that you can’t be a great place to work.”Benioff is trying to tell me that these are challenging times for business leaders—a common CEO mantra in today’s climate. At least, that’s what I think he’s trying to tell me. As is typical in conversations with the always-loquacious Benioff, the conversation soon takes a sharp turn to the philosophical.To be sure, the recent layoffs at Salesforce weren’t the first in its history. In 2000, when the dotcom bubble burst, Benioff laid off 20% of his workforce (and Salesforce has had small “adjustments” since). But that was before the company was public, back when it employed only 100 workers. It was also around the time that Benioff launched the company’s 1-1-1 model, which dedicates 1% of the company’s equity, 1% of its product, and 1% of employees’ time to philanthropic causes. The CEO has long championed business as the “greatest platform for change.” But he really solidified his role as one of the lead evangelists of the stakeholder capitalist movement during the pandemic.“In the pandemic, it was CEOs in many, many cases all over the world who were the heroes,” Benioff told a remote audience during the 2021 World Economic Forum gathering, which took place online instead of in the snowy mountain town of Davos, Switzerland. “They’re the ones who stepped forward with their financial resources, their corporate resources, their employees, their factories, and pivoted rapidly—not for profit, but to save the world.”Benioff, along with a team of other big-name execs, helped procure 50 million units of personal protective equipment like gowns and masks early on in the pandemic, shipping it from China to hospitals in the United States via chartered airplanes and trucks. As the pandemic was unfolding, demand exploded for software that helps businesses run their operations online, like Salesforce’s customer relationship management tools. Salesforce had already been hiring at a fast clip, and during the pandemic Salesforce onboarded another 20,000 employees in a one-year span—and of course many more through acquisitions like Slack.Other companies, like Amazon, have been decidedly more blunt. To wit, CEO Andy Jassy’s March 20 memo announcing a second round of layoffs: “I’m writing to share that we intend to eliminate about 9,000 more positions in the next few weeks … This was a difficult decision, but one that we think is best for the company long term.”While Benioff likes to say this is his third recession, many of his younger, newer hires haven’t yet lived through even one downturn during their careers. And even those who were not laid off have had to make uncomfortable changes. Early on in the pandemic, Salesforce embraced remote work, telling employees they could work from anywhere. When the company acquired collaboration tool Slack for $27.7 billion in July 2021, Benioff said integrating the product would help customers “make the digital transformation.” But that transition to remote work wasn’t as smooth as expected.Benioff made waves when he took to Slack, not long before announcing layoffs, to ask why employees hired during the pandemic showed “much lower productivity.” To the CEO, this was an effort to solicit feedback. But to some employees, Benioff’s musings felt like a betrayal, a stark contrast to the pandemic-era benefit of getting one Friday off per month, which had just recently ended.The reaction inside Salesforce was harsh, with some employees accusing Benioff of being tone deaf in Slack channels. Other recent cost-saving measures, such as lower annual “gratitude” bonuses and the decision to abandon Slack’s snazzy San Francisco headquarters, have also generated employee blowback. In late March, Salesforce also shuttered Future Forum, Slack’s ambitious think tank that was focused on research around remote work.Asked whether tech employees have gained too much power in recent years, Benioff says no, and points to Slack as an effective—if lively—way to communicate directly with employees on a variety of issues. But even that direct access has its limits. “It’s hard for them [employees] because they don’t understand why you’re taking certain actions or how it’s going to affect them,” says Benioff. “It’s understandable because we’ve had an up market for more than a decade.”In recent months, Salesforce has summoned certain employees back to the office. Some percentage of the company’s workforce will always be remote, as was the case pre-pandemic. But those who don’t have that designation are now being asked to come into the office at least a few times a month depending on their roles and teams, says Benioff, noting that tracking productivity is easier for certain functions, like sales and, to a lesser degree, engineering.“We hired a lot of people, and those folks don’t have the benefit of knowing others and having the office experience,” Benioff says of his evolving views on remote work. “Bringing them back into the office is becoming more important than I think anyone realized.”But again, justifying a return to office, however flexible, however backed by data, is hard to do when you’ve just spent the past three years telling employees they could work from anywhere. Just like announcing layoffs after you’ve hired hordes of new employees and told them they were like friends and family.In recent months, Benioff has gotten caught in the crosshairs of some conservative politicians who have jumped onto the anti-ESG bandwagon. Vivek Ramaswamy, 2024 Republican presidential hopeful and former executive chairman of Strive Asset Management, which owns a small stake in Salesforce, has criticized the CEO for choosing politics over profits. And with some blaming Silicon Valley Bank’s collapse on a supposed “distraction” by diversity efforts, it’s easy to see how some of Salesforce’s speed bumps could be smeared with similar allegations.But Benioff says his devotion to using business as a platform for societal change is intact.“There’s been a politicization of stakeholder capitalism which is in many cases unfair,” says Benioff. “What employees want is to be treated well, and to make sure that their companies are doing the right thing, which is at the heart of stakeholder capitalism.”Benioff has a point: Many of the times he’s taken a stand, like when he threatened to pull business out of Indiana because of an anti-LGBTQ law, came from listening to what his employees were telling him, not the other way around. At least as of now, Salesforce’s biggest activist shareholders—the ones who have actually acquired sizable stakes—are not speaking out about the company’s diversity programs, nor the fact that Benioff has made it his life mission to plant 1 trillion trees by 2030. They’re much more concerned with boosting software sales and profits. And in a succession plan.Bret Taylor wasn’t the first co-CEO to leave Salesforce, but his departure was a surprise. So were the subsequent exits of Stewart Butterfield, the former head of Slack, and of Mark Nelson, the ex-CEO of Tableau, another pricey Salesforce acquisition. “Each person has to make their own decisions,” says Benioff.8,000layoffs implemented by Salesforce since January 2023Asked whether he would pursue the co-CEO model again, Benioff says probably not anytime soon. “Right now, profitability is my only strategy,” he says, adding that he does have a current succession plan in place. (Who is the new heir apparent? Unsurprisingly, Benioff won’t say.)Whatever the plan is, Benioff is clearly under pressure to solidify it. Activist investors clamoring for change have already pushed Salesforce to appoint three new directors to its board. And unlike some other founder-CEOs, Benioff isn’t shareholder-proof. The board, if not satisfied, could vote him out.At least some signs seem to be pointing in the right direction for Benioff: On March 27, Salesforce and one of its loudest activist shareholders, Elliott Investment Management, issued a joint statement, with Elliott saying it was pleased with the company’s newfound commitment to “profitable growth,” and that it wouldn’t move forward with nominating its own slate of director nominations, which it had threatened to do.“I actually think it’s very healthy,” Benioff says of the role activist investors have played in his company’s decisions in recent months. “You’re going to meet people you’ve never met, and they’re going to have perspectives that are completely different. Their primary focus is to make money, and that’s what they’re doing.”For now, Benioff doesn’t see the goal of making money—and getting Salesforce on a more profitable track—as mutually exclusive with planting trees or investing in DEI initiatives or calling his workforce his family. “My performance speaks for itself, and that’s all I can hope for,” he tells me after his plane lands.

CRM,Salesforce Averts Elliott Proxy Fight After Share Gains,"(Bloomberg) -- Salesforce Inc. averted a potential proxy fight with activist investor Elliott Investment Management after its stock rose and the enterprise software company made a series of strategic changes.Most Read from Bloomberg$52 Billion Chipmaking Plan Is Racing Toward FailureNew Yorkers Are Moving to These Three Florida Cities$335,000 Pay for ‘AI Whisperer’ Jobs Appears in Red-Hot MarketFBI Releases Files on Ivana TrumpScotiabank Economist Excoriates Trudeau, Freeland Over $32 Billion Spending BoostElliott won’t proceed with its planned director nominations following Salesforce’s “strong” 2023 fiscal year report, transformation initiatives and “clear focus on value reaction,” the companies said in a joint statement on Monday.Salesforce Chief Executive Officer Marc Benioff has been grappling with a growing number of activist hedge funds agitating for higher profits. Revenue growth has slowed after a half-decade of steady hiring and large acquisitions, and the San Francisco-based company has been buffeted by executive changes including resignations of heir-apparent Bret Taylor and Slack co-founder Stewart Butterfield.Still, investors rejoiced earlier this month after the company trounced profit forecast estimates, doubled stock buyback plans and signaled it was putting its large acquisition strategy on ice. Shares have rallied 43% this year, among the largest jumps of companies in the S&P 500. They were little changed in New York at $190.29.Read More: Salesforce Finds Profit Is New Magic Word for Activist InvestorsMonday’s announcement without public concessions to the activist, like a board seat, is a win for Salesforce against Elliott, which took a multibillion-dollar stake in the software maker in January. The activist firm had put forward a slate of board directors in the open nomination window for the annual shareholder meeting, which usually is scheduled around June, suggesting the possibility of a proxy fight. In other companies, Elliott has pushed for CEOs to step down.Elliott released a positive statement after Salesforce’s blockbuster earnings, though said more work remains. The investor had earlier suggested some of the changes that Salesforce eventually made, though others, including further board director changes and succession planning, weren’t accepted at the time of earnings earlier this month.Salesforce and Elliott “have committed to continue the productive working relationship they have developed together,” the two companies said in the statement Monday. The “handshake” agreement to withdraw nominees doesn’t stop Elliott from re-engaging publicly with the company in the future, according to a person familiar with the matter who declined to be named discussing a private matter.“We feel pretty good about what we’ve been able to deliver so far,” Chief Operating Officer Brian Millham said Friday in an interview about Salesforce’s new focus on profit, before adding “it’s not a job that’s done by any stretch.” He said the firm could see job cuts beyond the 8,000 already announced, and hasn’t yet received final recommendations from consultant Bain & Co., with whom Salesforce is working to review the business.Beyond Elliott, Starboard Value, ValueAct, Jeff Ubben’s Inclusive Capital, and Dan Loeb’s Third Point have invested in Salesforce.

CRM,How Big Companies Choose Who Is Laid Off,"In the current economic environment, a final decision can take weeks, according to executives and corporate advisers. With layoffs that target corporate staff, department heads often take the lead and human resources troubleshoots their lists, which can lead to intense debate and multiple rewrites. “There is no good way to do this,” said Gregory DeLapp, a human-resources executive who spent much of his career at the steel and materials manufacturer Carpenter Technology in Pennsylvania, where he helped conduct layoffs.","March 26, 2023 at 3:30 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/m/a982b48b-2747-3519-99d8-382ea2e2520c/how-big-companies-choose-who.html,The Wall Street Journal,0.0,0.1,0.013636363636363641,0.3272727272727273,2023-03-26 03:30:00,2023-03-26 03:30:00,,,

CRM,"Is Salesforce.com (CRM) a Solid Growth Stock? 3 Reasons to Think ""Yes""","Investors seek growth stocks to capitalize on above-average growth in financials that help these securities grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task.By their very nature, these stocks carry above-average risk and volatility. Moreover, if a company's growth story is over or nearing its end, betting on it could lead to significant loss.However, the task of finding cutting-edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.Our proprietary system currently recommends Salesforce.com (CRM) as one such stock. This company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this customer-management software developer is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:Earnings GrowthArguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.While the historical EPS growth rate for Salesforce.com is 23.3%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 35.7% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 11.3%.Cash Flow GrowthWhile cash is the lifeblood of any business, higher-than-average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds.Right now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Salesforce.com is 12.1%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of 5.9%.While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 36% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 12.9%.Promising Earnings Estimate RevisionsSuperiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.The current-year earnings estimates for Salesforce.com have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 54.2% over the past month.Bottom LineSalesforce.com has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #1 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This combination positions Salesforce.com well for outperformance, so growth investors may want to bet on it.Salesforce Inc.

CRM,"Salesforce Considers More Job Cuts Amid Profit Push, COO Says","(Bloomberg) -- Salesforce Inc. could see another round of job cuts while the company continues to focus on improving profitability, said Chief Operating Officer Brian Millham.Most Read from Bloomberg$52 Billion Chipmaking Plan Is Racing Toward FailureNew Yorkers Are Moving to These Three Florida CitiesFBI Releases Files on Ivana Trump$335,000 Pay for ‘AI Whisperer’ Jobs Appears in Red-Hot MarketUBS Veteran Ermotti Returns to Lead Credit Suisse Takeover“The structure of the organization — if we feel like it needs to change and reshape — we’re going to make those moves to drive the efficiencies,” Millham said Friday in an interview. He added that consultant Bain & Co., which Salesforce is working with to review the business, has yet to provide final recommendations.After years of hiring and big acquisitions, the software company is newly focused on profitability. Salesforce in January announced it would eliminate 10% of its workforce, or about 8,000 employees, its largest-ever headcount reduction, and close offices across the US. A group of activist investors who have taken stakes in the company are pushing to cut costs further in search of increased earnings and improved profit margins.Salesforce wouldn’t be alone in the industry if it wiped out more jobs. Meta Platforms Inc., Amazon Inc. and Twilio Inc. announced additional rounds of major cuts in recent weeks, amounting to more 21,000 workers.Millham, who joined the company as its 13th employee in 1999 and was promoted to chief operating officer last year, said he’s focused on making the sales and go-to-market divisions he oversees more efficient, and finding new selling opportunities, such as with the company’s recently announced AI products. He has taken over some of the operational and customer-facing responsibilities previously held by co-Chief Executive Officer Bret Taylor before that executive left the company earlier this year, including appearances on earnings calls.The San Francisco-based company, the top maker of customer relations management software, has been looking at measures including reducing the number of salespeople assigned to each deal, utilizing third-party sellers and emphasizing productivity such as monthly sales targets, Millham said. Salesforce also is urging employees to go into the office more often, although it hasn’t imposed a return-to-office mandate. Attendance at company sites is up significantly in recent months, he said.“From the very beginning this was a performance-oriented culture,” Millham said. “We may have drifted a bit from that during the pandemic as we took care of our employees and made sure everyone was staying healthy.” He added that he wants Salesforce to have both a performance and wellness culture.The stock has jumped 43% this year, closing at $190.06 Friday in New York, making up almost all of its value after a 48% plunge in 2022.Investors rejoiced earlier this month when the company said it would reach margin targets years earlier than anticipated. “We feel pretty good about what we’ve been able to deliver so far,” Millham said, before adding “it’s not a job that’s done by any stretch.”Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe Texas Preacher’s $24 Million Ponzi SchemeSVB’s Collapse Shows the World’s Favorite Safe Asset Isn’t Risk-FreeCollege Students Are About to Put a Robot on the Moon Before NASAChina Lent Heavily to Developing Nations.

CRM,Salesforce: Risks Looming on the Horizon,"Salesforce Inc. (NYSE:CRM), the leading customer relationship management software solutions provider in the world, reported strong earnings for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 on March 1, attracting wide praise from Wall Street analysts, economists and investors. Shares popped more than 15% the following day with investors getting behind the company in hopes for much higher investment returns in the future with the company pledging to focus more on profitability and operating margins.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Signs with CRM. Click here to check it out. CRM 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of CRMPeter Lynch Chart of CRMThe company doubled its share buyback program from $10 billion to $20 billion as well - a move that improved the investor sentiment toward in an era where investors have lost faith in many tech companies.Although the outlook for Salesforce seems promising, a deeper dive into the company reveals several major risks looming on the horizon.Balancing margins and growth in a competitive marketSalesforce delivered a remarkable performance in its fiscal fourth quarter, which has been touted by many analysts as a pivotal moment in the company's growth story. The company exceeded Wall Street expectations by a considerable margin, reporting strong revenue and profitability that reflects the strength of its business model amid challenging macroeconomic conditions.The company reported $31.4 billion in revenue for full fiscal 2023, representing an 18% year-over-year increase or 22% in constant currency, indicating strong underlying growth trends.Salesforce had strong operating cash flow of $7.1 billion, the highest in the company's history, which is a testament to its operational efficiency and ability to generate cash from its core business operations. This significant increase of 19% reflects the company's focus on driving growth while also maintaining a strong financial position.The company's impressive performance is a result of its relentless focus on innovation and strategic investments in its platform and product offerings. Salesforce's cloud-based software solutions enable businesses to better manage their customer relationships and drive growth by improving customer engagement and satisfaction. However, despite its strong performance and market leadership position, the company is facing a few risks and challenges.One major issue is the presence of powerful activist investors who are seeking to exert control over the company. Elliott Management, one of the five activist investors of note, has put forward its own slate of candidates for the board of directors. This move is aimed at gaining enough voting control to impose its agenda, which could have significant consequences for the future of Salesforce.Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff has stated that he does not mind activist investors circling his company, as long as they are knowledgeable and have the best interests of the company at heart. However, he has been dismissive of Strive Asset Management, which was co-founded by 2024 Republican presidential hopeful and Woke Inc. author Vivek Ramaswamy. In a recent interview, Benioff referred to Ramaswamy as ""just a politician."" He said that anyone can be an activist, but those who are using activism for their own political agenda are not beneficial to the company.In recent times, the management structure and the growth strategy of Salesforce have become a major concern for investors. Two co-CEOs left their position in just three years, and activist investors believe that the company's management structure needs to be reviewed.Additionally, the company's focus on profitability is another challenge it's facing. Salesforce has achieved meaningful growth through acquisitions, but as investors demanded answers about Salesforce's balance of growth and margins, the company is now more focused on increasing profit margins. This new focus will result in the company curbing spending and investment, which could make it harder for Salesforce to address emerging threats such as the evolution of a long-time partner into a competitor.Veeva Systems Inc. (NYSE:VEEV), a company that sells software to life sciences organizations, is one such long-time partner that built its core software on top of Salesforce's app-development platform. However, this relationship will come to an end in 2025, and the company has announced that the contract with Salesforce will not be renewed as it has built CRM software in-house. It would not be surprising if a few other customers decide to follow Veeva to manage the long-term costs associated with hiring a third-party CRM software solutions provider. While Veeva has agreed to pay Salesforce as its customers use Salesforce's platform, the costs have risen as more people have come to rely on Veeva. In exchange for Veeva's payments, Salesforce has agreed not to enter Veeva's specialized, regulated market. This agreement is becoming challenging as Veeva becomes profitable and is a publicly traded software company with a $28 billion market capitalization. The move to ditch Salesforce is seen as positive for Veevas customers as it simplifies their landscape. However, it remains to be seen whether other large Salesforce customers will follow Veeva's lead and whether Salesforce will be able to develop technology to address these emerging threats.TakeawayDespite Salesforce's strong financial performance and apparent potential for continued growth, the company is not entirely free from risks and challenges. Some of these include concerns over management structure, profitability and emerging competition. With the influence of activist investors and a new focus on short-term profitability, Salesforce may find it difficult to address new threats effectively. Nevertheless, the company continues to hold a significant position in the cloud software development industry, and its actions in the future will be worth observing as it confronts these challenges. Balancing growth with profit margins will be crucial for Salesforce as it navigates these hurdles.","March 23, 2023 at 1:34 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/salesforce-risks-looming-horizon-193406554.html,GuruFocus.com,0.0,0.0,0.2217075673244505,0.49864929442851513,2023-03-23 13:34:00,2023-03-23 13:34:00,187.3999938964844,187.44000244140625,-0.04000854492184658
CRM,10 Best Blue Chip Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds,"The market is more uncertain than it has been in a while.In early March, Silicon Valley Bank, the 16th largest bank by assets in the United States at the end of last year, failed. Later in the same month, UBS has had to buy out Credit Suisse given substantial capital flight in the latter in recent quarters.Meanwhile, inflation is still pretty high and the Federal Reserve is expected to continue to raise interest rates.Given the uncertainty, leading blue chips can be more attractive than average stocks.Blue chips are established companies that are generally well known and that have substantial competitive advantages.Many blue chips generally have an extensive history of profitability and have growth potential. Many blue chips also have considerable market capitalization that rank among the market's largest by that metric. Furthermore, many blue chips return excess capital back to shareholders either through dividend or share buybacks or both.Blue chips also face the same headwinds as the market.If the economy slows further given the interest rate increases, blue chip stocks might not do well. If valuations in the broader market decreases, the valuations of many blue chips could decrease too.Despite the uncertainty, some leading blue chips with competitive advantages are trading for pretty attractive valuations given the decline in the market over the past few years. Although there could be more downside in the near term, many leading blue chips could do well in the long term as the U.S. economy and global economy continues to grow.As a result of the uncertainty, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of leading stocks across many different sectors.christian-wiediger-rymh7EZPqRs-unsplashMethodologyFor our list of 10 Best Blue Chip Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds, we picked 10 blue chip stocks with competitive advantages that ranked among the top 25 most widely held stocks by elite funds in our database of 943 hedge funds at the end of Q4.We ranked each stock based on the number of hedge funds in our database that owned shares of the same stock at the end of the fourth quarter.Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 97S&P Global Inc.

AMD,Billionaire Dan Loebs 2023 Portfolio: 10 Latest Stock Picks,"Since our engagement with Ms. Nash began, we have detected a pronounced aversion to including a shareholder representative on the Board. At the same time as we identified Ms. Brady, we proposed a fellow shareholder with impeccable credentials as a second candidate. This individual has years of public market experience, an exemplary record as a corporate director of a larger company, and a strong relationship with one of the top consumer investment companies in the world. Ms. Nash, who was presumably speaking on behalf of the Board, gave unconvincing explanations for rejecting this candidate.Shortly after rebuffing our candidate, and within a week of accepting Lucy Brady (though, oddly without recognizing our role in proposing her), yesterday, the Company hastily announced the appointment of Steve Voskuil to the Board. While we recognize Mr. Voskuil’s financial experience, this Board’s handpicked new director does not assuage our concerns about substantial corporate governance shortcomings. It is further concerning that the Board added a shareholder-identified candidate without being fully transparent about the process that led to her selection.It seems as if this Board is operating in triage mode rather than via best corporate governance practices. We fear the reason that the Board is reacting this way is because they (and others) have many reasons to close the curtain before shareholders can take a closer look at what transpired on their watch.Our Methodology To compile our list of Dan Loeb's latest stock picks, we look at the fund's latest filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and and picked the ten firms by investment in which Third Point had initiated new stakes in the first quarter.Third Point's Investment: $41.9 million Teck Resources Limited (NYSE:TECK) is a mining company that has operations in different countries all over the world.

AMD,"Here is What to Know Beyond Why Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) is a Trending Stock","Over the past month, shares of this chipmaker have returned +19.8%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry, which Advanced Micro falls in, has gained 7.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Advanced Micro is expected to post earnings of $0.57 per share, indicating a change of -45.7% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -14.6% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.83 points to a change of -19.1% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -9.5%.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.94 indicates a change of +39.2% from what Advanced Micro is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -4.9%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Advanced Micro.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Advanced Micro, the consensus sales estimate of $5.33 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -18.7%. The $22.97 billion and $26.39 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -2.7% and +14.9%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryAdvanced Micro reported revenues of $5.35 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -9.1%. EPS of $0.60 for the same period compares with $1.13 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.3 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.91%. The EPS surprise was +7.14%.Over the last four quarters, Advanced Micro surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Advanced Micro is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Advanced Micro. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

AMD,"Nvidia, AMD, Micron lead chip sector higher with AI, Japan in focus","(Reuters) - Shares in Nvdia Corp, Advanced Micro Devices and Micron Technology on Thursday provided the biggest boosts to the chip sector, which outperformed the broader market as investors looked for ways to invest in artificial intelligence and in Japan.Shares in chip design software company Synopsys shares ended up 8.7% after it forecast better-than-expected third-quarter profit estimates, saying increased use of AI and automation boosted its business.Nvidia shares were up 5.0%, while the Philadelphia semiconductor index gained 3.2%.Micron's shares climbed 4.1% after announcing it would invest up to 500 billion yen ($3.70 billion) in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) technology in Japan in the next few years with Japanese government support.Japan's President Fumio Kishida asked executives from companies, such as Micron, Intel Corp and Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC), to invest in Japan ahead of a three-day Group of Seven (G7) summit in Hiroshima, where member countries will discuss what they see as China's economically coercive policies and its accumulation of sensitive technology.Kim Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners in Pittsburgh put Thursday's rally down to continued investor interest in the emergence of artificial intelligence as the hottest new technology, more so than the news from Japan.""While it's encouraging that companies and countries are working together to expand capacity, for investors when companies are building new plants, it's generally not rewarding in the short term because that's where all the free cash flow goes,"" said Forrest.The money manager, who also cited Synopsys results as a positive sign for the chip sector, however, noted that investors see chips as the part of the AI story they can buy into today as ""there's no one company you can buy that's the lynchpin"" for AI.AMD shares were up 4.0% while Intel added 2.8%.

AMD,15% Of This Advanced Micro Devices Insider's Holdings Were Sold \,"While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. Check out our latest analysis for Advanced Micro Devices The insider, Forrest Norrod, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$4.1m worth of shares at a price of US$102 each. That means that an insider was selling shares at around the current price of US$101. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. We note that this sale took place at around the current price, so it isn't a major concern, though it's hardly a good sign. Forrest Norrod was the only individual insider to sell shares in the last twelve months.The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!For a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Advanced Micro Devices insiders own about US$829m worth of shares (which is 0.5% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body. We currently account for open market transactions and private dispositions, but not derivative transactions.","May 17, 2023 at 6:00 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-advanced-micro-devices-insiders-110027518.html,Simply Wall St.,0.4,0.6,0.1993353174603175,0.466984126984127,2023-05-17 06:00:00,2023-05-17 06:00:00,101.79000091552734,103.75,-1.9599990844726562

Earnings were better than expected, but revenue missed expectations broadly. So again, just not boding well for Lowe's ahead of-- for Home Depot, biggest revenue miss in more than 20 years. Lowering its forecast for the year.You know, another stock that we're watching today, Horizon Therapeutics, that stock taking a big hit. It sinking double digits, down 14% after the FTC sued to block Amgen's acquisition of the biotech. The government says the deal would stifle competition, arguing it would deepen Horizon's monopoly on treatments for thyroid eye disease and chronic refractory gout. Now, this marks a big stake in the ground by the FTC because, Akiko, it is the first time the government has sued to stop a pharma deal since 2009.But so much of the focus has been on the big tech deals.

But when you look at what happened today, Horizon Therapeutics getting hit in a big way on the back of that report, down well over 10%.We should note a federal judge still needs to approve the injunction.

Now, shares are higher today as the company kicked off its annual Sapphire conference in Orlando, Florida. The company announced that-- it announced a share buyback program of up to 5 billion euros, and also taking place at the event, SAP provided an update to its 2025 ambition. Now, that is the company's midterm financial release that reflects both its expected divestitures of Qualtrics and also reflected strength in cloud momentum for the company.In terms of other companies seeing major market moves today, AMD shares traded higher, and this did come on the heels of news that Daniel Loeb's Third Point took up new positions in Advanced Micro. Shares were higher by as much as 5% on the session. And according to a regulatory filing, the hedge fund has a stake of 1 million shares in the chip maker. Heading into the close, shares of AMD do remain higher.Last but not least, let's take a look at RH. Now, that is the company known formally as Restoration Hardware.

AMD,"Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights: Dexcom, Rambus, Advanced Micro Devices, Nvidia and Vipshops","Chicago, IL – May 16, 2023 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Dexcom DXCM, Rambus RMBS, Advanced Micro Devices AMD, Nvidia NVDA and Vipshops VIPS.In choppy markets, combining technical and fundamental strength becomes paramount. Below are 3 stocks that hold these characteristics and are on the verge of breaking out:DXCMDexcom's unique monitoring system is used to continuously measure a patient's blood glucose level and transmit that information to a small cell phone-sized receiver in real-time. Though the blood glucose monitoring Dexcom is highly competitive, DXCM is the leader. Last quarter, EPS grew 113% year-over-year on revenue growth of 18%.The company's EPS of $0.17 beat Zacks estimates of 15 cents by 13.3%. The positive surprise was nothing new. DXCM has a strong history of beating estimates – in 17 out of the last 19 quarters, the company has surprised to the upside.A stock that has sound fundamentals and breaks out from a long base can produce robust results. DXCM fits the criteria – the stock is emerging from a consolidation dating back to October 2022. Should the breakout hold, expect fireworks to the upside in the coming weeks.With diabetes rates increasing in the U.S. and worldwide, DXCM should benefit from solid healthcare tailwinds.RMBSRMBS has grown top and bottom-line results at a double-digit clip for several quarters in a row, and the stock's strong Zacks #2 (Buy) ranking suggests that may continue.The most intriguing part of RMBS is its strong price and volume action. RMBS has been hugging the 50-day moving average for all of 2023. The recent post-eps pullback and subsequent rebound off the 50-day moving average is a golden opportunity, in my opinion.China had one of the most stringent COVID-19 lockdown policies in the entire world. In fact, at times, Chinese President Xi was willing to allow the Chinese economy to come to a screeching halt to tamp down coronavirus cases. Throughout this time, Vipshops and most other Chinese companies suffered. However, in the past three quarters, VIPS has turned around its EPS picture and has grown EPS by 12%, 55%, and 27%. Despite the widely publicized reopening of the Chinese economy, analysts seem slow to change course. VIPS has delivered positive surprises in four straight quarters, including big beats of 42.31% and 33.33%.Finally, it appears that analysts are catching on to Vipshop's renewed growth trajectory. In the past seven days, Zacks Consensus Estimates for 2023 and 2024 have been revised higher.When searching for a monster stock, two of the most powerful traits to look for are a strong uptrend and relative strength. VIPS holds both of these characteristics. Over the past year, the stock is up 91.1% while the S&P 500 Index is +2.9% - impressive when considering the volatility that occurred in global markets.The stock has been consolidating for the past five months and is pulling into the rising 50-day moving average – an attractive reward-to-risk zone. VIPS is scheduled to report earnings Wednesday.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

AMD,Billionaire Ken Fishers Top 10 Stock Picks,"Our MethodologyFor this article we picked the top 10 stocks from Ken Fisher's hedge fund portfolio for the first quarter of 2023.Fisher Asset Management’s Holdings: $2,346,771,000 Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is the world's largest chip manufacturer.Like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is one of the top stock picks of billionaire Ken Fisher.“Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) contributed to performance as revenues grew +27% (in USD) from the year ago quarter. Despite this strength, the Company’s customers have seen near-term weakness in demand due to Covid-19 normalization as well as the launch timing of new products. However, the Company is well-positioned to continue a long-term growth trajectory because its leading-edge capacity is being absorbed by high-performance computing applications, particularly at nontraditional integrated circuit (IC) design houses, such as Apple, Alphabet and Amazon, which have become IC-design powerhouses over the past decade. Importantly, the Company’s aggressive investment in leading-edge equipment, tight development with fabless IC designers, and embrace of open development libraries, should continue to foster a superior competitive position and attractive long-term growth.”Fisher Asset Management’s Holdings: $2,478,511,000 The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) is a leading home improvement retailer with over 2,300 stores and a strong omnichannel network.Fisher Asset Management started building its position in The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) in the first quarter of 2012 and, in the first quarter of 2023, holds over 8.40 million shares in the company, valued at $2.49 billion. The company represents 1.5% of the hedge fund’s 13F portfolio.“The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) provided an update on reducing the environmental impact of its stores. Since 2010, the company has reduced U.S. store electricity use by 50% by implementing LED lighting across all of its stores, buying electricity from large-scale commercial solar farms, and installing rooftop solar farms. The company is now applying its experience to other parts of its operations, including reducing electricity use in its supply chain and water use in store irrigation. Home Depot was also recognized by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for being one of the nation’s largest green power users.”Fisher Asset Management’s Holdings: $2,579,321,000 Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is a semiconductor company that makes chips for various applications, including PCs, gaming, cloud services, and automotive.On May 3, Truist analyst William Stein increased Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)'s price target to $84 from $79, but maintained a ‘Hold’ rating on the stock. Despite the company's revenue exceeding expectations due to the upside in Gaming and Embedded segments, the analyst is concerned about AMD's weaker Q2 guidance and increasing investments in AI.Fisher's hedge fund also strengthened its position in Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) by buying 431,867 additional shares in Q1.“Last quarter we added Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) to the portfolio at 18x earnings and quickly made it into a top 5 position. At that time, Mr. Market was worried about earnings revisions for semiconductor stocks. In Q1 2023, it has been one of our best performing positions with the stock up 50%! In just three months, the market realized that Artificial Intelligence (AI) and related technologies require a lot of semiconductors. Mr. Market really is manic depressive but this volatility can give the enterprising investor just enough of a window to pick stocks with attractive risk rewards.”Fisher Asset Management’s Holdings: $2,798,969,000 Percentage of Fisher Asset Management’s Portfolio: 1.69%NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides graphics, compute, and networking solutions globally.Ken Fisher is also bullish on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) as of the end of the first quarter of 2023. His fund increased its holding in NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) by 1% in the first quarter, ending the period with over 10.08 million shares of the company.“NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a semiconductor mega-cap company and global leader in gaming cards and accelerated computing hardware and software. Shares of NVIDIA rose over 90% during the first quarter because of material developments in generative AI evidenced by the release of ChatGPT and other competitive models. On its fourth quarter fiscal 2023 earnings call on February 22, Colette Kress, NVIDIA’s CFO said, “AI adoption is at an inflection point.… The opportunity is significant and driving strong growth in data center that will accelerate through the year.” On the same call, Jensen Huang, NVIDIA’s CEO emphasized: “The accumulation of technology breakthroughs has brought AI to an inflection point. Generative AI’s versatility and capability has triggered a sense of urgency at enterprises around the world to develop and deploy AI strategies.… NVIDIA AI is essentially the operating system of AI systems today.… The activity around AI infrastructures…has just gone through the roof in the last 60 days. And so there’s no question that whatever our views [were] of this year as we enter[ed] this year has fairly dramatically changed as a result over the last 60, 90 days.” Indeed, our research indicates that shortages of NVIDIA GPUs3 are the biggest gating factor for AI adoption and that about 90% of AI-model training runs are performed on their GPUs. During its annual GTC conference4 in March, NVIDIA announced new products and services that expand its addressable market and together form a full AI computing platform. These included: (1) new AI training systems (where it is dominant) and inferencing systems (where the field is more wide open), such as specialized chips in the areas of large language models and recommender systems, simulation and graphics rendering, and video use cases; (2) new fully managed AI services in partnership with the major cloud service providers, called NVIDIA DGX Cloud and NVDIA Omniverse Cloud; (3) new domain-specific generative AI foundational models, branded NVIDIA AI Foundations, which NVIDIA customers can harness to build and train custom language models with their own proprietary data to develop differentiated offerings; and (4) industry-specific accelerator libraries, spanning such diverse verticals as genomics analysis and computational lithography. We continue to believe NVIDIA’s end-to-end AI platform and leading market share in gaming, data centers, and robotics (including automotive), along with the size of these markets, will enable the company to drive durable growth for years to come.”Fisher Asset Management’s Holdings: $2,801,441,000 Percentage of Fisher Asset Management’s Portfolio: 1.69%Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) provides global Customer Relationship Management (CRM) technology.Along with Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) is one of the top stocks on the radar of billionaire Ken Fisher.“Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) was a material contributor during the quarter. The company has taken numerous positive steps to increase profitability more quickly than expected. Salesforce also improved its corporate governance by recommending three new board members. The company is focused on improving margins, deemphasizing acquisitions, and has expanded its stock buyback plan from $10 billion to $20 billion. We believe Salesforce can pursue these opportunities while continuing to increase its competitive position.”  Suggested articles:12 Best Information Technology Services Stocks to Buy16 Most Profitable Value Stocks Now12 Best Household and Personal Care Stocks To Buy","May 14, 2023 at 6:15 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/billionaire-ken-fisher-top-10-231527952.html,Insider Monkey,0.5,0.5,0.193179788961039,0.45081980519480497,2023-05-14 18:15:00,2023-05-14 18:15:00,,,

AMD,"Should You Think About Buying Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) Now?"," Check out our latest analysis for Advanced Micro Devices According to my valuation model, Advanced Micro Devices seems to be fairly priced at around 13.91% above my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Advanced Micro Devices today, you’d be paying a relatively reasonable price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $83.63, there’s only an insignificant downside when the price falls to its real value. So, is there another chance to buy low in the future? Given that Advanced Micro Devices’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us an opportunity to buy later on. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Advanced Micro Devices' earnings over the next few years are expected to double, indicating a very optimistic future ahead. This should lead to stronger cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.","May 13, 2023 at 7:00 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/think-buying-advanced-micro-devices-120016122.html,Simply Wall St.,0.4,0.6,0.210514705882353,0.4505147058823529,2023-05-13 07:00:00,2023-05-13 07:00:00,,,

AMD,16 Biggest PC Companies in the World,"Since its inception in the late 1970s, the personal computer (PC) industry has experienced enormous growth. People now rely on personal computers for a wide range of tasks, including business, entertainment, and education, making them a vital element of society. In many regions of the world, access to technology, particularly to personal computers (PCs), has changed from a privilege to a necessity.With supply chain issues and a deteriorating macroeconomic environment, the chip crisis has had a huge impact on the industry. The PC market is currently experiencing a slowdown and increasing inventory levels, which began to accumulate in the first half of 2022. A sluggish economy is also having an effect on the demand for enterprise PCs. Midway through 2022, PC demand among businesses started to decline. Enterprise sales, however, aren’t likely to return to growth until sometime next year. Resulting from these headwinds, the US PC market declined 20.5% in the last quarter of 2022. Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) PC market also had an unprecedented downturn, falling by 37.2% year over year. Likewise, the Asia Pacific market outside of Japan contracted by 29.4% over the previous year. The Chinese government's budget constraints and the haziness surrounding potential changes to COVID regulations caused a sizable decline in overall PC demand.Now that we are familiar with the PC industry, let’s get to our list of the 16 biggest PC companies in the world.The biggest PC companies in the world were identified after extensive study using a range of reliable sources, including corporate and industry reports and financial databases.

AMD,"Institutional investors have a lot riding on Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) with 72% ownership","Significantly high institutional ownership implies Advanced Micro Devices' stock price is sensitive to their trading actionsThe top 25 shareholders own 44% of the companyAnd last week, institutional investors ended up benefitting the most after the company hit US$153b in market cap. One-year return to shareholders is currently 10% and last week’s gain was the icing on the cake.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Advanced Micro Devices. See our latest analysis for Advanced Micro Devices Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Advanced Micro Devices. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Advanced Micro Devices' historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.Since institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Advanced Micro Devices is not owned by hedge funds. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 8.5% of shares outstanding. With 7.5% and 4.0% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.On studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.With a 28% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Advanced Micro Devices. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

Logistics real estate, meanwhile, has some of the most attractive market dynamics of all real estate subsectors, and Prologis is a clear leader within the group.

AMD,"Is Trending Stock Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) a Buy Now?","Shares of this chipmaker have returned -2.8% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.2% change. The Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry, to which Advanced Micro belongs, has lost 3.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Advanced Micro is expected to post earnings of $0.57 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -45.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -14.8%.The consensus earnings estimate of $2.84 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -18.9%. This estimate has changed -9.5% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.93 indicates a change of +38.5% from what Advanced Micro is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -5.1%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Advanced Micro.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Advanced Micro, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $5.33 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -18.7%. For the current and next fiscal years, $22.97 billion and $26.41 billion estimates indicate -2.7% and +15% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryAdvanced Micro reported revenues of $5.35 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -9.1%. EPS of $0.60 for the same period compares with $1.13 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.3 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.91%. The EPS surprise was +7.14%.Over the last four quarters, Advanced Micro surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Advanced Micro is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Advanced Micro. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

AMD,This week in tech: A banner week for Apple; whiplash for AMD,"By Louis JuricicInvesting.com -- Here is your weekly Pro Recap on the past week's most momentous tech headlines: Solid earnings out of Apple and Square, a whipsaw week for AMD, soft guidance from Qualcomm, and a narrower loss than expected at Coinbase.On Thursday Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) topped first-quarter estimates with earnings per share of $1.54 vs. the $1.43 average analyst estimate, driven by stronger-than-expected iPhone sales.Apple also boosted its dividend and announced a $90 billion share buyback program.Goldman Sachs raised the price target to $209 per share on Buy-rated AAPL stock after ""strong"" results:""We gain confidence in our Buy rating and believe AAPL shares continue to be attractive.""KeyBanc also hiked the price target, to $180 per share from the prior $177, noting that Emerging Markets strength a the tech giant offloaded weaker U.S. results.Shares were up more than 2% for the week.Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) reported a better-than-expected Q1 on Tuesday but issued disappointing guidance, triggering a 9% selloff in the shares in the next session.BofA cut the stock to Neutral from Buy, citing a ""range of headwinds"" including ""aggressive pricing/promotion pressure from main rival Intel (NASDAQ:INTC).""Citi, for its part, raised the price target on AMD stock to $85 per share, and BMO highlighted the company's continued market share gains against Intel.Then, on Thursday afternoon, shares clawed most of their way back following a story from Bloomberg that said Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is helping finance AMD’s expansion into AI chips.Microsoft and AMD have teamed to create an alternative to Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) processors for artificial intelligence, the report said, citing people with knowledge of the matter. Microsoft will provide financial support to bolster AMD’s efforts, as it works with the chipmaker on a homegrown Microsoft processor for AI workloads.AMD shares were ultimately off about 1% for the week.Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) shares slid after the company forecasted far lower-than-anticipated results for is fiscal third quarter: The company expects 3Q23 EPS in the range of $1.70-$1.90, compared with the consensus of $2.20, and revenue in the range of $8.1-8.9B, compared to the consensus of $9.25B.Q2 earnings of $2.15 per share were in line with expectations.The company said demand for smartphones had deteriorated as China remains weak, calling the macroeconomic environment ""challenging.""Deutsche called the guidance ""disappointing by any measure"" but also believes the company ""should be an attractive beneficiary of the eventual cyclical rebound once one actually occurs (not a matter of if, but rather when).""Shares sank more than 7% for the week.Block (NYSE:SQ) shares initially bumped higher after the fintech name reported better-than-expected Q1 results: earnings per share of $0.40 vs. Wall Street's estimate of $0.35, and above-par revenue of $4.99 billion.For the full year, the company raised its full-year adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) forecast to $1.36 billion, up from the prior $1.3B.Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan were both positive on the stock after earnings. JPMorgan sees more room for further upside, calling its operating leverage potential ""underappreciated by the market."" It added, ""SQ remains one of our favorite ideas.""For the week, though, shares slipped 2.5%.Coinbase's Q1 results were better than feared, driven by cost cuts and a jump in subscription revenue: The company lost just $0.34 per share, far better than expectations for $1.39 in the red.After its Thursday report, shares were trading about 9% higher.Looking ahead, the company said it expected subscription and services revenue to fall in the second quarter. For the full year it continues to seek to improve full-year 2023 adjusted EBITDA in absolute dollar terms versus full-year 2022.BofA said the results were solid but that big fundamental questions remain unanswered about the company, and maintained its Underperform rating on Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN): ""We continue to think retail crypto volumes will remain weak and the regulatory overhang will linger for some time,"" the analyst said in a note.Barclays lowered the price target to $61 from $74 per share. The analyst highlighted an uplift in retail take rate, while also noting that this trend may not prove to be sustainable.Senad Karaahmetovic and Davit Kirakosyan contributed to this report.Related ArticlesThis week in tech: A banner week for Apple; whiplash for AMDBinance resumes Bitcoin withdrawals after temporary closure4 big deal reports: More tremors across regional banks","May 7, 2023 at 12:07 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/week-tech-banner-week-apple-170723589.html,Investing.com,0.0,0.0,0.11254545454545456,0.47724242424242425,2023-05-07 12:07:00,2023-05-07 12:07:00,,,

AMD,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AMD) Fundamentals Look Pretty Strong: Could The Market Be Wrong About The Stock?","Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. See our latest analysis for Advanced Micro Devices Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Advanced Micro Devices is:0.7% = US$395m ÷ US$55b (Based on the trailing twelve months to April 2023).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.01.Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.It is quite clear that Advanced Micro Devices' ROE is rather low. Even compared to the average industry ROE of 17%, the company's ROE is quite dismal. In spite of this, Advanced Micro Devices was able to grow its net income considerably, at a rate of 41% in the last five years. Therefore, there could be other reasons behind this growth. Such as - high earnings retention or an efficient management in place.Next, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Advanced Micro Devices' growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 31% in the same period, which is great to see.Advanced Micro Devices doesn't pay any dividend currently which essentially means that it has been reinvesting all of its profits into the business. This definitely contributes to the high earnings growth number that we discussed above.","May 5, 2023 at 9:00 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/advanced-micro-devices-inc-nasdaq-140030175.html,Simply Wall St.,0.14583333333333331,0.8083333333333333,0.10463414634146344,0.43680023228803705,2023-05-05 09:00:00,2023-05-05 09:00:00,84.98999786376953,89.83999633789062,-4.849998474121094
AMD,10 Best International Index Funds To Buy,"While shares of the duo are traded on American exchanges, a variety of other important firms, particularly those in the world's second largest economy China, are not. This makes for an important argument for investing in foreign markets, supplemented by the fact that economic downturns in America might not be replicated in other countries - and investing in foreign stocks could prove to be an effective way to protect one's portfolio (or even grow it) during an economic downturn.For some time, the forecast for the U.S. economy prepared by the staff had featured subdued real GDP growth for this year and some softening in the labor market. Given their assessment of the potential economic effects of the recent banking-sector developments, the staff’s projection at the time of the March meeting included a mild recession starting later this year, with a recovery over the subsequent two years. Real GDP growth in 2024 was projected to remain below the staff’s estimate of potential output growth, and then GDP growth in 2025 was expected to be above that of potential. Resource utilization in both product and labor markets was forecast to be much less tight than in the January projection. The level of real output was projected to move below the staff’s estimate of potential output in early 2024, more than a year sooner than in the previous projection. Likewise, the unemployment rate was projected to rise above the staff’s estimate of its natural rate early next year.So, if there's a recession in the U.S., where the rates have been raised higher than in other regions, then foreign investing makes more sense. At the same time, another key reason many institutional investors invest abroad is that emerging markets often give higher returns than developed markets. Of course, most of these investments are in bonds with fixed interest rates, but the business potential in emerging markets can contribute to firms operating in those areas seeing big gains in their share price.. . . The Fed wasn't really going, in May I point that Jerome Powell said . . we aren't even considering 75 basis point hikes. Then in June they rose rates, overnight lending rates, by 75 basis points, the next meeting 75 basis points, the next meeting 75 basis points, the next meeting 75 basis points. He said that in May. Market fell to October. They're still raising rates. Where are we now in the market? Where we were in May!

AMD,AMDs AI Progress Wins Over Traders Seeking More Than Just Promises,"(Bloomberg) -- Promises of a future when artificial intelligence drives a surge in sales for chipmakers are no longer cutting it in the stock market. These days, hard evidence of progress toward that is needed.Most Read from BloombergPeter Thiel Says Moving to Florida from Silicon Valley Is Too ExpensiveHeavy Marijuana Use Increases Schizophrenia in Men, Study FindsSEC Investigates Trades by First Republic Executives Before Sale to JPMorganBruised Banks Fuel Short-Covering Rally in Stocks: Markets WrapBMW Warns Owners ‘Do Not Drive’ 90,000 Cars Recalled Over Defective AirbagTake the case of Advanced Micro Devices Inc. The stock jumped 6.1% on Thursday on news it’s working with Microsoft Corp. on technology for AI workloads to rival those from Nvidia Corp. That almost erased losses suffered a day earlier after a weak revenue forecast overshadowed assurances from Chief Executive Officer Lisa Su that AMD is well positioned to capitalize on growth in AI computing.Chip-related stocks have emerged this year as a popular way for investors to gain exposure to AI after the adoption of OpenAI’s ChatGPT created a trader frenzy. The biggest beneficiary so far has been Nvidia, whose shares are up 90% this year in a reflection of its market dominance. As its only real rival in the type of graphics chips that data center owners are increasingly turning to, AMD has gained 32%.“AI deserves all the hype it gets and more,” said Olivier Sarfati, head of equities at GenTrust. “Money is going to be made in processors, cloud services, data center, to say nothing of industries in general.”Still, just talking about a company’s capabilities for AI computing isn’t getting the rosy reception from investors it once did. In the absence of new developments, market watchers are turning their gaze to a more immediate issue — weak demand for personal computers and smartphones.The work with Microsoft doesn’t change much right now for AMD fundamentally, according to Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon, and on Friday AMD shares slipped back 1.8%. Instead, it offers “a narrative boost as they try to shift the story toward AI,” he wrote in a note.To that end, AMD’s Su dedicated a large chunk of this week’s earnings call to AI. The area is the company’s “number one strategic priority,” she told analysts, highlighted by the more than 50 mentions of the term ‘AI’ on the call.Underlining the trend, Qualcomm Inc. CEO Cristiano Amon also talked up his company’s AI bona fides on the chipmaker’s earnings call on Wednesday. Yet that wasn’t enough to stop the stock from falling more than 5% the following day after a quarterly revenue forecast that trailed estimates.Chegg’s 50% Wipeout Shows Shock of AI Colliding With US BusinessThe true test of whether investors are now turning a deaf ear to promises of future AI business will come later this month when Nvidia reports. The surge in its shares has added $330 billion in market capitalization and made the company the sixth most-valuable in the S&P 500.Even more remarkable is that the rally has come amid falling sales. Nvidia’s revenue has been hurt by the slump in personal computers and is expected to have dropped 22% in the first quarter, according to the average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.Three months ago when Nvidia last reported earnings the term ‘AI’ was used more than 80 times on its conference call with analysts. While CEO Jensen Huang has earned the right to talk about the subject more than anyone else, there’ll be more pressure than ever to keep proving it’s translating into real earnings growth.Tech Chart of the DayThe Nasdaq 100 Index is coming off a four-day drop, the longest such streak for the tech-heavy index since a five-day decline that ended in December. While the streak is the longest of the year, the scale is relatively muted; the gauge only declined 2% during the current slump. The index remains up about 19% this year, and recently closed at its highest since August. The index rose 0.9% on Friday.Top Tech StoriesSales of Apple Inc.’s iPhone rebounded last quarter, helping the world’s most valuable company top earnings estimates and weather an industrywide downturn that has battered much of its product lineup.Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook expressed cautious optimism about the flood of new artificial intelligence services, saying that while the technology has huge potential, there also are “a number of issues that need to be sorted.”Cook singled out India as pivotal for the iPhone maker, underscoring how the world’s most populous country is on the cusp of becoming both a major market and production base.A senior software engineer at Google wrote a critique asserting that the internet search leader is losing its edge in artificial intelligence to the open-source community, where many independent researchers use AI technology to make rapid and unexpected advances.Tesla Inc. raised the prices of its premium models in China, following a small increase in the cost of its top-selling Model 3 and Model Y earlier in the week.Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.’s international online shopping unit is exploring a US initial public offering as it weighs options to spur growth for the business that includes major e-commerce brands Lazada and AliExpress.--With assistance from Ryan Vlastelica and Subrat Patnaik.(Updates to market open.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekAirbus Bets on a Stretched A220 Jet to Beat Boeing’s 737How a Dishwasher Engineer Challenged Elon Musk’s Grip on Commercial SpaceEven $500 Million a Year From Google Isn’t Enough to Save FirefoxData Science Is the Hot New Master’s at B-SchoolsToo Big to Fail, But Not Too Big to Bail Out Other Banks©2023 Bloomberg L.P.","May 5, 2023 at 8:40 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amd-ai-progress-wins-over-134007274.html,Bloomberg,0.4,0.35,0.09607195013821519,0.44283497626871116,2023-05-05 08:40:00,2023-05-05 08:40:00,84.98999786376953,89.83999633789062,-4.849998474121094

AMD,4 big earnings hits: Apple comes out on top; AMD dives on weak outlook | Pro Recap,"Investing.com -- Here is your Pro Recap of the biggest earnings reports you may have missed this week: Cheery news from Apple and Pfizer, dour guidance at AMD, and sliding shares at Starbucks despite an earnings beat.""We are pleased to report an all-time record in services and a March quarter record for iPhone despite the challenging macroeconomic environment, and to have our installed base of active devices reach an all-time high,"" CEO Tim Cook said.The company also unveiled a $90B share buyback plan and boosted its quarterly dividend by a penny to 24 cents per share.Shares were rising 2.5% in recent premarket trading Friday.EPS for Q1 was $0.60, better than the consensus estimate of $0.56, and revenue of $5.4B edged out the $5.3B forecast.But sluggish Q2 sales guidance prompted Bank of America to downgrade the stock to Hold from Buy and to trim its price target to $95 from the prior $98.BofA sees a ""range of headwinds"" for the company, including ""aggressive pricing/promotion pressure from main rival {Intel,"" as well as concerns on second-half data center growth, lackluster positioning in AI accelerators, and limited room for further expansion in its price-to-earnings multiple until revenue ""re-accelerates back to historical levels.""The numbers were driven by growth in its core North America market and a rebound in China. Comparable-store sales, or sales at locations open a year or more, climbed 11%.Starbucks also reaffirmed its 2023 outlook on the earnings call. JPMorgan said the results were strong but that the full-year guidance was likely not enough to please investors, noting:""People were very focused on 'macro uncertainty' tempering US results, China recovery, and a variety of near term expense investments intended to drive medium term productivity that served to constrain any expected upside in F23.""Morgan Stanley also surmised that investors likely wanted more from the company. As far as Q1 is concerned, though, it said Starbucks delivered ""an impressive quarter by most measures"" and that ""key fundamental drivers remain intact.""Sales fell 29% year-over-year as Pfizer generated 77% less from its COVID-19 revenue. Still, the reported $3.06B in vaccine sales topped analyst estimates of $2.6B. Paxlovid revenue came in at $4.07B, crushing the $2.7B expectations.Pfizer reaffirmed its full-year forecast for adjusted EPS of $3.35 on revenue of $69B. Paxlovid is seen generating $8B in full-year sales.The company said it expects to achieve 7%-9% operational revenue growth for the full year, excluding COVID-19 product and foreign exchange impacts, and that the majority of that growth should come in the second half.Senad Karaahmetovic, Scott Kanowsky, and Davit Kirakosyan contributed to this report.Related Articles4 big earnings hits: Apple comes out on top; AMD dives on weak outlook | Pro RecapLyft tumbles 16% on weak outlook; stock a 'show me' story say analystsApple tops estimates on stronger iPhone sales; Goldman says stock remains 'attractive'","May 4, 2023 at 10:57 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-big-earnings-hits-apple-035719058.html,Investing.com+6.11%,0.041666666666666664,0.4083333333333334,0.1415892857142857,0.5197797619047619,2023-05-04 22:57:00,2023-05-05 10:30:00,84.98999786376953,89.83999633789062,-4.849998474121094
AMD,Microsoft Working With AMD on Expansion Into AI Processors,"(Bloomberg) -- Microsoft Corp. is working with Advanced Micro Devices Inc. on the chipmaker’s expansion into artificial intelligence processors, according to people with knowledge of the situation, part of a multipronged strategy to secure more of the highly coveted components.Most Read from BloombergPeter Thiel Says Moving to Florida from Silicon Valley Is Too ExpensiveApple Shares Rise After iPhone Bounces Back, Sales Top EstimatesJPMorgan Sees Investors Moving to Gold, Tech Amid Recession RiskChina Takes the Yuan Global in Bid to Repel a Weaponized DollarHeavy Marijuana Use Increases Schizophrenia in Men, Study FindsThe companies are teaming up to offer an alternative to Nvidia Corp., which dominates the market for AI-capable chips called graphics processing units, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the matter is private. The software giant is providing support to bolster AMD’s efforts, including engineering resources, and working with the chipmaker on a homegrown Microsoft processor for AI workloads, code-named Athena, the people said.Frank Shaw, a Microsoft spokesman, denied that AMD is part of Athena. “AMD is a great partner,” he said. “However, they are not involved in Athena.”AMD shares jumped more than 6.5% on Thursday, and Microsoft gained about 1%. AMD representatives declined to comment. Nvidia stock declined 1.9%.The arrangement is part of a broader rush to augment AI processing power, which is in great demand after the explosion of chatbots like ChatGPT and other services based on the technology. Microsoft is both a top provider of cloud-computing services and a driving force of AI use. The company has pumped $10 billion into ChatGPT maker OpenAI, and has vowed to add such features to its entire software lineup.Read More: Microsoft to Bring OpenAI’s Chatbot Technology to Office AppsThe move also reflects Microsoft’s deepening involvement in the chip industry. The company has been building up a silicon division over the past several years under former Intel Corp. executive Rani Borkar, and the group now has a staff of almost 1,000 employees. The Information last month reported on Microsoft’s development of the Athena artificial-intelligence chip.Several hundred of those employees are working on the Athena project, and Microsoft has spent about $2 billion on its chip efforts, according to one of the people. But the undertaking doesn’t portend a split with Nvidia. Microsoft intends to keep working closely with that company, whose chips are the workhorses for training and running AI systems. It’s also trying to find ways to get more Nvidia’s processors, underscoring the urgent shortage Microsoft and others are facing.Microsoft’s relationship with OpenAI — and its own slate of newly introduced AI services — are requiring computing power at a level beyond what the company expected when it ordered chips and set up data centers. OpenAI’s ChatGPT service has drawn interest from businesses that want to use it as part of their own products or corporate applications, and Microsoft has introduced a chat-based version of Bing and new AI-enhanced Office tools.It’s also updating older products like GitHub’s code-generating tool. All of those AI programs run in Microsoft’s Azure cloud and require the pricey and powerful processors Nvidia provides.The area is also a key priority for AMD. “We are very excited about our opportunity in AI — this is our No. 1 strategic priority,” Chief Executive Officer Lisa Su said during the chipmaker’s earnings call Tuesday. “We are in the very early stages of the AI computing era, and the rate of adoption and growth is faster than any other technology in recent history.”Su also said that AMD has an opportunity to make partly customized chips for its biggest customers to use in their AI data centers.From Bloomberg Businessweek: Doing, Not Just Chatting, Is the Next Stage of the AI Hype CycleBorkar’s team at Microsoft, which has also worked on chips for servers and Surface computers, is now prioritizing the Athena project. It’s developing a graphics processing unit that can be used for training and running AI models. The product is already being tested internally and could be more widely available as soon as next year, said one of the people.Even if the project makes that timeline, a first version is just a starting point, the people said. It takes years to build a good chip, and Nvidia has a substantial head start. Nvidia is the chip supplier of choice for many providers of tools for generative AI, including Amazon.com Inc.’s AWS and Google cloud, and Elon Musk has secured thousands of its processors for his fledgling AI business, according to reports.Creating an alternative to Nvidia’s lineup will be a challenging task. That company offers a package of software and hardware that works together — including chips, a programming language, networking equipment and servers — letting customers rapidly upgrade their capabilities.That’s one of the reasons Nvidia has become so dominant. But Microsoft isn’t alone in trying to develop in-house AI processors. Cloud rival Amazon acquired Annapurna Labs in 2016 and has developed two different AI processors.

But the new AmpereOne offerings announced Thursday are the first that use Ampere's own custom-designed computing cores, which are the most important part of the chips, which are in turn the brains of data center servers that power everything from business apps to social media sites.The new Ampere chips will have as many as 192 of those cores where Intel chips tend to have only a few dozen. The high core counts are because cloud companies make money by slicing up chips and selling just a piece of their computing power to customers, and having a large number of cores makes doing so easier.After Ampere disclosed its approach, Advanced Micro Devices announced a 128-core chip based on the what is called the ""x86"" architecture used by AMD and Intel. Intel also has a high-core-count chip in the works.""It's flattering that the x86 vendors have been able to get closer to us, but we're well on our way to higher core counts now,"" said Jeff Wittich, Ampere's chief product officer.Ampere last year filed a confidential registration with U.S. securities regulators for an initial public offering. Oracle, where Ampere's CEO James sits on the board, is a major investor. James declined to say when Ampere might go public.""We did not pull our registration. We are ever hopeful that the market will open and that it will open for growth companies,"" James said.(Reporting by Stephen Nellis in San Francisco; Editing by Mark Potter)","May 18, 2023 at 10:03 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ampere-computing-launches-custom-chips-150346476.html,Reuters,0.0,0.0,0.14920038295038296,0.4022002997002996,2023-05-18 10:03:00,2023-05-18 10:03:00,29.0,29.68000030517578,-0.6800003051757812
INTC,Intel Makes Technology More Accessible for People with Hearing Loss,"Several projects aim to increase access to assistive devices and improve their integration with other technologies.Working with Intel and Accenture, 3DP4ME uses 3D printing to bring assistive technology to people in developing countries. 3DP4ME is piloting its project in Jordan, taking scans of children’s ears and printing custom-fitted hearing aids. (Credit: 3DP4ME)Technology is integral to helping people with disabilities live independently and participate fully in all aspects of life. Within Intel, there is a movement to improve accessibility for people with hearing loss from multiple angles. Several projects are ongoing at Intel to increase access to assistive devices and improve their integration with other technologies.Increasing Access to Hearing AidsAccessibility starts with access, and in much of the world, access to hearing aids is prohibitively expensive.""Previous work to provide hearing aids to children included hand-making the custom ear molds. It was a craft that was labor-intensive, and you could only make four or five hearing aids a day,"" says Jason Szolomayer, founder of 3DP4ME. ""There were long wait times, even after the kids were tested. Using 3D printing allows us to scale up the service we provide to families and kids who need hearing aids.""The goal is to scale this capability to reach thousands of people in need – and, ultimately, democratize hearing solutions around the globe.Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger, who uses a hearing aid, is also working to drive awareness of the importance of accessible technology.Improving Hearing Aid Connectivity to ComputersAs people increasingly use computers for work, school and social activities, assistive technology must integrate seamlessly with PCs.In collaboration with top hearing aid vendors, Intel is working to improve the user experience when connecting hearing aids to laptops. With the help of employees who are hard of hearing, a team in Intel's Client Computing Group (CCG) is working to use Bluetooth LE Audio to enable a direct connection between ""Engineered for Intel® Evo™"" verified hearing aids and Intel Evo PCs, and to close the compatibility gap that currently limits people’s ability to use their hearing aids on their computers.The current experience depends on many factors, including the type of computer and the kind of hearing aid, and requires an intermediary device such as a dongle or dedicated box.Individuals using hearing aids typically must join meetings on multiple devices, use captions for presentations running on a separate screen and wear a headset in addition to their hearing aid. Intel hopes this collaboration will help improve this process and create a wireless connection between hearing aids and PCs.Providing a Clearer Audio ExperienceIntel’s CCG Accessibility Project includes several initiatives that go beyond solving hearing aid compatibility problems. All Ears is an ambient-aware artificial intelligence platform that acts as a Bluetooth LE hearing aid assistant.Working in shared or noisy environments can be particularly challenging for people with hearing disabilities. This technology recognizes critical sounds the user cares about and offers a visual notification on their screen for noises that are happening in their environment, such as a knock on the door or a specific person calling their name. This allows the user to focus on what’s happening on their PC while staying connected to relevant ambient sound in the room.These accessible technology efforts are part of Intel's long-term commitment to inclusivity. Intel leaders believe assistive technology and accessibility drive innovation and they will continue to work to create world-changing technology to improve the life of every person on the planet.About Intel© Intel Corporation.

INTC,"AI Data-Center Boom Will Spur Energy Crisis, Chip CEO Warns","(Bloomberg) -- The surging demand for artificial intelligence computing has a downside, according to chip-industry veteran Renee James: It’s sucking up too much energy to be sustainable.Most Read from BloombergMcCarthy Puts Debt-Limit Talks on ‘Pause’ as Clock Ticks DownDisney Closes Florida Star Wars Hotel, Scraps Plan to Move 2,000 EmployeesMorgan Stanley CEO Gorman to Step Down Within 12 MonthsWall Street Fears $1 Trillion Aftershock From Debt DealNYC Skyscrapers Sit Vacant, Exposing Risk City Never PredictedMany data centers handling AI tasks have already outgrown the amount of power they can get from public utilities, said James, formerly a top executive at Intel Corp. But she sees this looming energy crisis as an opportunity for her current company, Ampere Computing, which makes processors that require less electricity.“Who doesn’t love AI?” she said. “But we cannot continue to throw power at it. It just doesn’t work.”Ampere, a five-year-old startup based in Intel’s hometown of Santa Clara, California, is unveiling new processors this week that offer more efficiency. Data center giants such as Microsoft Corp.’s Azure and Alphabet Inc.’s Google already use Ampere’s current generation of chips, and James looks to make further inroads with her latest lineup, called AmpereOne.The company packs its chips with a large number of computing cores that perform multiple calculations in parallel, letting them use less power. The top of the new range, the first Ampere product to use in-house designs rather than blueprints licensed by Arm Ltd., will have 192 cores.The new processors, which are being manufactured by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. using that company’s 5-nanometer process, are designed to put pressure on Intel and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. Those companies have dominated the server processor market for decades, but they’re also trying to adapt — and that includes fielding new products with high core counts. Still, James expects to stay in the lead on this trend with AmpereOne.Fundamentally, she argues, improving performance while keeping power consumption flat is the only way that the chip industry can meet the needs of data center clients. That runs counter to the long-dominant approach: performance at any cost.Even Ampere’s more energy-sipping designs are thirsty compared to other electronics. The tiny components top out at 350 watts, more than twice as much power as a large flat-screen television would consume. But the company claims that a rack equipped with 36 of its current chips will do the same work as 54 AMD microprocessors or 82 Intel chips.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekApple’s New Headset Meets RealityJapan’s New Military Might Is Rising in a Factory in HiroshimaESG Investing Goes Quiet After Blistering Republican AttacksThe True Cost of an Extended US Debt-Ceiling StandoffSweetgreen Tests Robots to Make Faster, More Efficient Sad Desk Salads©2023 Bloomberg L.P.","May 18, 2023 at 10:00 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ai-data-center-boom-spur-150000924.html,Bloomberg,0.0,0.0,0.1145187903883556,0.4033689378254595,2023-05-18 10:00:00,2023-05-18 10:00:00,29.0,29.68000030517578,-0.6800003051757812

INTC,Why the red-hot tech trade may crumble: Morning Brief,"This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can receive in your inbox every Monday to Friday by 6:30 a.m. ET along with:The chart of the dayWhat we're watchingWhat we're readingEconomic data releases and earningsMost of the Nasdaq's advance could be attributed to speculative triple-digit percentage moves in biotech stocks. But there have been a host of big moves in well-known names: Tesla is 40% on the year, Roku has clawed back 39% and Booking Holdings is up 32%.Market pros tell me the relative out-performance for tech stocks reflects two things.And two, the expectation of a Fed rate hike pause has fueled a renewed interest in the tech trade. Tech investors foam at the mouth at the idea of lower rates, and after a long series of hikes, simply not hiking has the same effect. This has proven time and time again as a key driver of tech valuation multiples.The problem is that the good times in tech stocks could be approaching some form of pause just like the rate hikes.As a result of these macro risks, the valuations on many tech stocks look extended. I think JP Morgan strategist Mislav Matejka nailed this vibe in a new client note.""Our call is that bond yields will be down further from here, but [the] tech bounce appears to have over-discounted that now. In addition, the clear and rising risk is that the Fed does not deliver on market expectations for cuts in second half of the year. Real rates could stay higher, with tech inversely correlated to them,"" Matejka said. ""With respect to the earnings outlook, consensus expectations are for the technology sector to expand its profit margins by as much as 140 basis points next year, the largest increase of all sectors, and which would put it at new all-time highs. We see risks to this, especially if the economy weakens into a downturn.""Bank of America's Michael Hartnett said on Friday in a note the tech trade could ""crack"" in large part due to a more hawkish Fed.So there is all of that.And the component here is that tech looks done with the profit-boosting expenses cuts.So investors banking on epic profits from tech in the second half of the year due to new expense savings may be let down.Bottom line: respect the tech trade, but realize nothing good lasts forever.Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance","May 15, 2023 at 8:00 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-the-red-hot-tech-trade-may-crumble-morning-brief-130045266.html,Yahoo Finance,0.0,0.3333333333333333,0.11669964955679239,0.364663986806844,2023-05-15 08:00:00,2023-05-15 08:00:00,28.899999618530277,29.799999237060547,-0.8999996185302699

INTC,Intel Corporation (INTC) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,"Shares of this world's largest chipmaker have returned -9.2% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +0.9% change. The Zacks Semiconductor - General industry, to which Intel belongs, has gained 1.4% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Intel is expected to post a loss of $0.03 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -110.3%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1475%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $0.41 points to a change of -77.7% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -23.9%.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $1.78 indicates a change of +334.1% from what Intel is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Intel is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Intel, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $11.98 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -21.8%. For the current and next fiscal years, $51.43 billion and $58.58 billion estimates indicate -18.4% and +13.9% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryIntel reported revenues of $11.72 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -36.2%. EPS of -$0.04 for the same period compares with $0.87 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $11.05 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +5.98%. The EPS surprise was +75%.Over the last four quarters, Intel surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Intel is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Intel. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Intel Corporation (INTC) : Free Stock Analysis ReportTo read this article on Zacks.com click here.Zacks Investment Research","May 15, 2023 at 8:00 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intel-corporation-intc-trending-stock-130001493.html,Zacks,0.0,0.0,0.09729591836734694,0.45027210884353724,2023-05-15 08:00:00,2023-05-15 08:00:00,28.899999618530277,29.799999237060547,-0.8999996185302699

INTC,"Shareholders in Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) have lost 46%, as stock drops 7.6% this past week","After losing 7.6% this past week, it's worth investigating the company's fundamentals to see what we can infer from past performance. View our latest analysis for Intel While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Over the three years that the share price declined, Intel's earnings per share (EPS) dropped significantly, falling to a loss. Since the company has fallen to a loss making position, it's hard to compare the change in EPS with the share price change. But it's safe to say we'd generally expect the share price to be lower as a result!The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.","May 12, 2023 at 6:00 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/shareholders-intel-nasdaq-intc-lost-110045275.html,Simply Wall St.,-0.25,0.25,0.09871794871794873,0.4141025641025642,2023-05-12 06:00:00,2023-05-12 06:00:00,29.030000686645508,28.950000762939453,0.07999992370605469

INTC,Opinion: Intel Surpasses First 2030 Goal: $2 Billion in Diverse Supplier Spending,"Early success boosts Intel's commitment to strengthening supplier diversity in the semiconductor ecosystem.The first general contractor for Intel's Ohio construction project committed to 20% diverse spending, exceeding the 10% expectation outlined in Intel's Supplier Diversity Policy. Intel is investing more than $20 billion in the new semiconductor manufacturing site in Licking County, Ohio, to produce leading-edge chips. (Credit: Intel Corporation)Intel’s commitment to a more inclusive supply chain allows us to leverage our purchasing power to address social gaps in our pursuit of fair business practices. Included in today’s milestone are two more goals that have been met early:$250 million in spending with U.S. Black-owned suppliers by end of 2023.$800 million in spending annually with minority-owned suppliers globally by end of 2023.We attribute the ability to reach our goals ahead of schedule to our processes and incentives that encourage diverse suppliers to work with us. Additionally, due to our rapid manufacturing expansion around the world in the past few years, we have had the opportunity to bring in more suppliers than ever before.Influencing Inclusion Across the Semiconductor EcosystemWhen Intel launched its supplier diversity program, there was limited awareness among semiconductor manufacturers of the positive benefits diverse suppliers bring to the supply chain. Through several initiatives and proactive partnerships with our largest non-diverse suppliers and industry groups, Intel has led the expansion of diverse-owned suppliers across the semiconductor industry.In 2016, we began formally inviting our manufacturing and construction suppliers to join us in building a more inclusive supply chain. We encouraged these suppliers to create their own supplier diversity programs and to report their spending with diverse subcontractors working on Intel contracts by incentivizing them with supplier scorecard points, which are prerequisites for prestigious Intel supplier awards. While originally this initiative was small, today it represents 45% of our 2022 total reported diverse spending.Why It MattersBeyond the impact that our technology has on people’s lives, we strive to make a positive difference in our supply chain and in our communities. Developing a diverse semiconductor ecosystem creates equitable opportunities for individuals from historically underserved groups and helps uplift their communities. By working with diverse-owned suppliers, we increase our resilience, and generate new value within our global supply chain and the communities in which we operate.A diverse and inclusive supply chain also introduces greater competition and helps drive innovation. Diverse-owned suppliers have proven to bring different perspectives and innovative solutions that benefit our customers and stakeholders. For example, when larger direct suppliers could not deliver a critical component last year, a woman-owned supplier successfully filled the gap to help Intel fulfill a customer commitment.Since launching our renewed supplier diversity and inclusion (SD&I) commitment in 2015, we have also seen the direct impact of increased competition within our supply chain. Four of the five diverse suppliers on Intel’s supplier scorecard are outperforming their competitors.What’s Next: Maintaining MomentumSince Intel began its focus on supplier diversity from a standing start in 2015, we have progressively exceeded our commitments, including the most recent achievement of our 2030 diverse supplier spending goal, and we are not done. For Intel, supplier diversity is not added work. It’s how we work.We continue to operate in a tough market while simultaneously pursuing our multiyear corporate transformation. As we work to establish a new goal against a renewed timeline, we will continue to focus on maintaining our progress and providing opportunities for diverse suppliers and subcontractors to help us in this transformation.About Intel© Intel Corporation.

A graphic shows details from Intel's 2022-23 Corporate Responsibility Report. (Credit: Intel Corporation)The past several years demonstrated how central technology is to every aspect of human existence. Semiconductors power the essential technologies in a world that is becoming increasingly digital.2022 was a challenging year for Intel. We continue to operate in a tough market, while simultaneously pursuing our multiyear transformation. To overcome these challenges, we remain committed to the highest ethical standards and to use our resources and ingenuity to solve the world’s greatest challenges. Our dedication to environmental, social and corporate governance is key to our success as a business.I was reminded of this with the recent passing of Intel’s co-founder Gordon Moore, an icon whose legacy continues to inspire us every day. Moore was an avid philanthropist and established our commitment to environmental sustainability during a time when companies were not thinking about it the way they are today. This was a big part of his legacy and why corporate responsibility and sustainability remain deeply engrained in Intel’s DNA.Over the past year, we have had some incredible achievements implementing sustainability as an industry initiative:In 2022, we also saw the historic passage of the CHIPS and Science Act. This was a victory for the semiconductor industry as well as American technological leadership and innovation; it will boost American semiconductor research, development and production, ensuring U.S. leadership in technology that forms the foundation of everything from household appliances to defense systems. Public-private partnerships are key to generating the large, long-term investments needed to develop critical technologies of the future.We’re committed to deepening our collaborations to build on our current successes. Together, we can further drive tech as a force for good – ensuring the scale of our work with others to create a more responsible, inclusive and sustainable world, enabled through technology and the expertise and passion of our employees. For example, this past year we also:We are all part of a globally interconnected evolution. As we continue to transform human progress, we must continue to create world-changing technology that improves the life of every person on the planet. Intel remains fully committed to executing our strategy to deliver leadership products anchored on open and secure platforms, powered by at-scale manufacturing and supercharged by our people. Our company and our people will continue to have a profound influence driving business and society forward by creating radical innovation that revolutionizes the way we live.About Intel© Intel Corporation.

INTC,16 Biggest PC Companies in the World,"Since its inception in the late 1970s, the personal computer (PC) industry has experienced enormous growth. People now rely on personal computers for a wide range of tasks, including business, entertainment, and education, making them a vital element of society. In many regions of the world, access to technology, particularly to personal computers (PCs), has changed from a privilege to a necessity.With supply chain issues and a deteriorating macroeconomic environment, the chip crisis has had a huge impact on the industry. The PC market is currently experiencing a slowdown and increasing inventory levels, which began to accumulate in the first half of 2022. A sluggish economy is also having an effect on the demand for enterprise PCs. Midway through 2022, PC demand among businesses started to decline. Enterprise sales, however, aren’t likely to return to growth until sometime next year. Resulting from these headwinds, the US PC market declined 20.5% in the last quarter of 2022. Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) PC market also had an unprecedented downturn, falling by 37.2% year over year. Likewise, the Asia Pacific market outside of Japan contracted by 29.4% over the previous year. The Chinese government's budget constraints and the haziness surrounding potential changes to COVID regulations caused a sizable decline in overall PC demand.Now that we are familiar with the PC industry, let’s get to our list of the 16 biggest PC companies in the world.The biggest PC companies in the world were identified after extensive study using a range of reliable sources, including corporate and industry reports and financial databases.

INTC,"Despite An Another Bad Update, Intel Still Believes It Can Uplevel Its Chip Game","Without disclosing the exact number of job cuts, Intel only confirmed on May 9th it will be reducing its workforce across areas. Intel’s cost cutting strategy was said to be ‘working’ as the semiconductor giant expects to save about $3 billion this year and as much as $10 billion annually by 2025. As a sign of efficient cost controls and operations, Intel expects gross margin to expand to approximately 37.5% on a non-GAAP basis in the undergoing quarter.Layoffs are no surprise after massive 36% YoY drop in overall revenue that amounted to $11.7 billion, but still topped Refinitiv’s consensus estimate of $11.04 billion.Intel made a net loss of $2.8 billion during its latest reported quarter. This translates to a loss of 66 cents per share which is a dramatic difference to last year’s comparable quarter when Intel made a net profit of $8.1 billion, or $1.98 per share. When the impact of inventory restructuring, change to employee stock options and other acquisition-related charge is excluded, earnings per share dropped a staggering 133% YoY but the adjusted loss per share of 4 cents was still better than what analysts had expected, which was 15 cents according to Refinitiv’s consensus.Intel’s strongest product line, chips that power desktop and laptop PCs, is struggling with the PC industry slump as it experienced a revenue drop of 38% on an annual basis.The server chip division which belongs to the Data Center and AI segment suffered an even more severe decline, as it slumped 39% to $3.7 billion.For the second quarter, Intel expects sales of $12 billion to result in a loss of 4 cents per share, while Refinitiv consensus stands at revenue of $11.75 billion and 1 cent in earnings per share.Digital Trends reported that laptops powered by Intel’s Meteor Lake chips may not even need a discrete graphics card as the power of the integrated iGPU will be at the level of rival Nvidia’s GTX 1650 and possibly even Apple M2 chip but in a different way. To achieve victory across the board, Intel-based laptops need to come close to the battery life of the Apple MacBook Pro powered by the M2 chip and graphics level of Nvidia GTX 1650 graphics. This is how Intel Meteor Lake chips could potentially empower Intel to compete with Apple and Nvidia. These promising chips are expected by end of the year, but only in laptops with the desktop range still remaining a concept.DISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

INTC,Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) is a favorite amongst institutional investors who own 62%,"Given the large stake in the stock by institutions, Intel's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisionsThe top 25 shareholders own 39% of the company Recent purchases by insiders Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Intel. See our latest analysis for Intel Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.Intel already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Intel's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.Institutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Intel. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 8.8% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 8.0% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 4.3% by the third-largest shareholder.Our studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.The definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.The general public-- including retail investors -- own 38% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

Intel, whose shares rose last week on a more upbeat PC market outlook, gained about 3%.""Even if Intel didn't gain share this quarter, it seems unlikely that they lost any either,"" Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said in a client note.""While we will see if Intel's 2024 roadmap holds water or not, the competitive environment next year is likely to get tougher for AMD.""The PC market has been in a slump for the past few quarters after a demand surge during the pandemic, while data center spending has also slowed as the economic outlook worsens.AMD, whose smaller and more efficient data center chips had helped it take market share from Intel last year, missed estimates for both PC and data center chip sales in the first quarter.Its sales forecast for the current quarter was also below market expectations, though the company was optimistic that the chip market would start to recover in the second half of 2023.""AMD results were more vulnerable (to the PC slump) than Intel's because most AMD-based PC customers were consumers.

INTC,Investors Heavily Search Intel Corporation (INTC): Here is What You Need to Know,"Over the past month, shares of this world's largest chipmaker have returned -7.9%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.5% change. During this period, the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry, which Intel falls in, has lost 0.9%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Intel is expected to post a loss of $0.03 per share, indicating a change of -110.3% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -889.3% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $0.56 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -69.6%. This estimate has changed +0.3% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $1.78 indicates a change of +218.2% from what Intel is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -2.1%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Intel is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Intel, the consensus sales estimate of $12.02 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -21.5%. The $51.21 billion and $58.6 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -18.8% and +14.4%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryIntel reported revenues of $11.72 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -36.2%. EPS of -$0.04 for the same period compares with $0.87 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $11.05 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +5.98%. The EPS surprise was +75%.Over the last four quarters, Intel surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Intel is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Intel. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Intel Corporation (INTC) : Free Stock Analysis ReportTo read this article on Zacks.com click here.Zacks Investment Research","May 2, 2023 at 8:00 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-intel-corporation-130001679.html,Zacks,-0.2,0.5,0.09586734693877552,0.44812925170068013,2023-05-02 08:00:00,2023-05-02 08:00:00,30.176425442951743,29.648588180541992,0.5278372624097507

INTC,Does Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) Have A Healthy Balance Sheet?,"Debt is a tool to help businesses grow, but if a business is incapable of paying off its lenders, then it exists at their mercy. If things get really bad, the lenders can take control of the business. However, a more common (but still painful) scenario is that it has to raise new equity capital at a low price, thus permanently diluting shareholders. Of course, plenty of companies use debt to fund growth, without any negative consequences. When we think about a company's use of debt, we first look at cash and debt together. View our latest analysis for Intel As you can see below, at the end of April 2023, Intel had US$50.3b of debt, up from US$37.2b a year ago. Click the image for more detail. However, because it has a cash reserve of US$27.5b, its net debt is less, at about US$22.7b.According to the last reported balance sheet, Intel had liabilities of US$27.4b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$57.5b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting this, it had US$27.5b in cash and US$4.09b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$53.3b.In the last year Intel had a loss before interest and tax, and actually shrunk its revenue by 27%, to US$56b. That makes us nervous, to say the least.","May 2, 2023 at 6:00 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/does-intel-nasdaq-intc-healthy-110025220.html,Simply Wall St.,0.5,0.5,-0.050279106858054215,0.383133971291866,2023-05-02 06:00:00,2023-05-02 06:00:00,30.176425442951743,29.648588180541992,0.5278372624097507

INTC,"PC slump: We did better than people expected, Intel CEO says","Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss company earnings, battling inventory corrections, investor sentiment, AI, and the outlook for Intel.Q1 earningsDespite Intel’s Q1 earnings, Gelsinger remained positive. He said, “All of the steps of our turnaround are underway. Good execution on the product side, good execution on the process, technology momentum that we have and I think investors are looking at.”Generative AIWhen asked about Intel’s integration of AI, Gelsinger added, “We're driving a software environment that enables everyone in the world. Generative AI becomes mainstream with democratization of AI and that's where Intel comes in.”Video highlights:00:00:30 - Intel Q1 earnings00:01:30 - Inventory corrections00:03:40 - New products00:05:10 - Generative AI00:08:00 - Outlook for Intel[MUSIC PLAYING]Pat, always nice to get some time through here. So a little different story today in terms of the stock market reaction compared to the previous few quarters. Shares of Intel up here almost 6%. What do you think investors are taking away from the quarter?Good execution of the product side. Good execution on the process technology. Momentum that we have. And I think investors are looking at it and seeing a bit of the green shoots, as we've described, that's starting to emerge in the Intel turnaround story.So in the PC marketplace, we're actually pretty optimistic that we've bounced off the bottom and now are starting to see a good trajectory. And the data center and cloud market, hey, it was a tough quarter. But even there, we did better than people expected. And we think we were able to hold market share. And I call that a turning point to the data center market one where we've been fighting for a while. And we had to fight through some poor product execution.Our next-generation Gen 4 Xeon, the Sapphire Rapids product ramping very well hitting a million units. And all four of the next-generation products, the second half of this year. Key new products for next year on our next-generation process technology. Intel 3 looking very healthy. The market is seeing us deliver those before they expected.So all of that is reinforcing product execution as well as process execution. And that combination is saying, wow, these guys are really starting to lean in tough market. But they're starting to stabilize. And as I said, the first moment that I see these glimmers of hope in the data center business. Tough inventory in the networking markets and edge. But even there, we're starting to see that, hey, we're have a good handle on this. We don't think we lost any market share. It's just overall tough market conditions.And obviously globally, we're starting to see China start to emerge a bit more. And a second half in the tech industry is definitely stronger, and then the first half and most year. So all of those put together, we're a bit optimistic that Q1, improvement in Q2, and improvement through the second half of the year.On a leadership process technology, like Intel 3, the combination of a stronger server product on a stronger process technology gave everybody in the marketplace a bit of more-- bit more confidence than I think people expected. And with that, we're obviously be building that in the US. A key process technology for US manufacturing but also for our foundry business as well.Well, I think that combination of getting back to leadership and the data center with leadership process technology, everybody has looked at that and says, wow, they're starting to get their execution mojo back. And I think that was one of the things that I was most proud of. My team in the first quarter really executing product process and financial discipline.And I sort of think about that Sozzi-like weather simulations. Only a few have machines big enough to build them. But then many need to use them. And that's what we call learning versus inference. And inference is one where we say everybody wants to be able to take advantage of those large language models, but using them, not creating them. And that's really where the second layer of this comes in.And we're starting to compete for the large language models. We have new component called Gaudi2, right, which is setting performance records for those largest training environments. But Intel is much more about democratizing AI. And that's where products like our Xeon Gen 4 Sapphire Rapids' strong performance on AI helping customers to inference. And we see inferencing to become the dominant AI workload, an area of more natural strength.But then we also say the third piece is we need to enable the entire software ecosystem across every platform that we deliver. And our next-generation client, for instance, has a lot of AI capabilities because you'll be able to do things on the client generating your text, being able to do eye movement into your Zoom, being able to do real-time language translation in your team's call.But also then at the edge, right, where you'll be using, inferencing for in-store analytics or for security in the data centers of our enterprise customers where they want to be able to take those big models but use it locally with their data without eliminating any of their restrictions around security and data privacy. And finally, helping for those super, ultra-large language model creation. So we're driving a software environment that enables everyone in the world. Generative AI becomes mainstream with democratization of AI. And that's where Intel comes in.Oh, the product, oh, a little bit better than we thought. They're getting their mojo back. And then, of course, the big investments around our process technology leading to the foundry business. A whole new area that is so aligned with the Western interests of a balance-resilient supply chain.Our margins, we laid out a picture for that improving as we go through the year, as we go through the reserves and the front end of the year as we start building back and having a fully loaded factories, improving the margin structure of the company for the long term. Clearly, we've laid out a multi-year path for that to accomplish. We've got a lot of work to do. But Q1 meet, beat, and raise was a great foundation to build on for the rest of the year.[MUSIC PLAYING]","April 28, 2023 at 10:42 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/pc-slump-did-better-people-154235211.html,Yahoo Finance Video,0.2,0.45,0.14162140270630835,0.40582271502082823,2023-04-28 10:42:00,2023-04-28 10:42:00,31.849574738990853,30.933326721191406,0.9162480177994468
INTC,"Intel Q1 earnings: This was a horrible quarter, analyst says","Bernstein Research Managing Director and Senior Analyst Stacy Rasgon joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss Intel earnings, slowing PC demand, the risk of a recession, and the outlook for Intel.[AUDIO LOGO]In other words, things are pretty bad for Intel. So even some kind of little marginal improvement is seen as good news by the market. Is there going to actually-- do you think that improvement is going to materialize?However, they set the bar much lower than that. And expectations have been rock bottom. And that's sometimes, that's all it takes. I mean, the big question people are trying to answer on Intel is is it as bad as it can get? And from what we heard last night, the answer to that plausibly could be yes. It could be as bad as it could get.They are looking for a bit of a recovery in the back half. They used the word ""modest,"" although there is enough there to maybe believe that it could be better than modest. They've got people excited now about gross margins getting back to 40%, which, again, is an unbelievable kind of statement. You never would have thought they'd be this low in the first place.But we're at the point now where I think you can plausibly make the case that we'll see how long it takes for things to get better. I don't know. But hopefully things can't get worse from here. And that's why the stock is up today. Even in the midst of a horrible quarter, expectations were even lower. Sometimes that's all it takes.Revenues collapsing. They did beat expectations, by the way, because they set the expectations so low. But, I mean, revenues were down a ton. They were down I think both their PC and their data center businesses were down almost 40% year-over-year.Gross margins are now well into the 30s. Free cash flow, they burned $9 billion in free cash flow in the quarter. I mean, it was pretty horrendous.Q2 is going to be bad, but it won't be quite that bad. And they're looking for things to get better in the back half. So yes. And beyond that, call me in a few years. We'll see.So now PCs have corrected. And their shipments have gone from overshipping now to undershipping. And they think in Q1, they actually undershipped the market by 20%.So that doesn't last forever. And so even if PCs didn't grow, at some point, you go from undershipping by 20% to shipping in line. That's actually a pretty material lift, half over half, right, if that normalization happens. And it should happen at some point.In data center, again, it's been very weak. Enterprise in China have been weak for quite a while. They've probably hit bottom. Those may start to get better. They've got new products that are launching in the back half with higher prices. They talked about little green shoots in China maybe. So, again, plausibly you can argue that can get better.What would be the risk to this? Clearly there's a demand and a macro statement. Yeah, if we hit a hard landing and they're looking for PCs for the year to come in around 270 million units, I'm closer to 250. But fine. What if they were 220 because macro was horrible? That would be a risk. That's not strictly an Intel risk. That would be like in everybody risk.And some of what we're seeing in terms of the low revenue is because they are flushing out inventory from the channel. They are undershipping and demand. That should get better once the channel inventory is normalized. So that's something that they're doing, which is OK.But I'd say on the client side, on the PC side, their roadmap looks pretty good. And on the data center side, the products have been delayed, but those products are finally ramping. They have new products that are coming next year.They had a data center event a few weeks ago, where they talked about that being on track. Maybe those will slip. I don't know. I don't have a ton of confidence. But if they do slip, they don't have to tell us about it for almost a year. So at least for the next probably four quarters, everything's going to look like it's on track.In terms of the broader strategy, so, look, they're investing a ton of money. They're trying to build a third-party foundry business and everything else. It's painful. Now, you could argue it's the right strategy in the sense that if Intel wants to have a robust and viable company 5 years, 10 years down the line that is competitive with the best in the world, they're probably doing the right thing. They have to invest heavily to do that.Their mistake was setting expectations so high. I don't know why Pat came in and just sounded so bullish. He should have come in and said, look, we think we're on the right path, but you guys have to be patient. It's going to be a slog. And they didn't really do that.But if that's the goal, that's the right strategy because their alternative is to lay down and die, right? Turn it into IBM. We're not going to invest. We're just going to manufacture earnings and just manage a business in decline.That is a model. You can run a company like that. That's not what Pat came in to do. And that's not what the strategy is.So in 5 years or 10 years, maybe this is the right strategy. But the problem is we won't know if it's going to work for five years. That's the biggest problem with owning the stock structurally here. Even if it's off the bottom-- we upgraded it a few weeks ago on exactly this thesis, that probably it can't get any worse.But doesn't mean I want to own it because the problem is I have no idea what the company looks like in five years. It's impossible to know at this point. And given that uncertainty and the fact that even if what they're doing is the right thing, the chances of success are not guaranteed. I think it's a hard thing to own structurally.","April 28, 2023 at 10:00 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/intel-q1-earnings-horrible-quarter-150051725.html,Yahoo Finance Video,-1.0,1.0,0.020217721432007153,0.4670642822785681,2023-04-28 10:00:00,2023-04-28 10:00:00,31.849574738990853,30.933326721191406,0.9162480177994468

INTC,Apple and Microsoft Have Never Held More Sway Over the S&P 500,"(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. and Microsoft Corp. have never held more sway over the S&P 500 Index, leaving some investors on edge over the gauge’s increasingly top-heavy nature.Most Read from BloombergFDIC Asks Banks for Final First Republic Bids Due SundayHarley-Davidson Says Repo Shortage Is Fueling Credit LossesTwitter Co-Founder Dorsey Rues Musk Deal: ‘It All Went South’First Republic’s Fate Uncertain After Stock’s Harrowing DropA Century-Old Dynasty Overhauls Its Billions in Rare M&A BetThe world’s two most-valuable companies saw their combined weightings in the benchmark jump to a record 14% this week after strong earnings reports from Microsoft and others fueled a rally in technology stocks. When you include Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Meta Platforms Inc. and Nvidia Corp, nearly a quarter of every dollar put into the S&P 500 is now split between just six names.“It’s concerning to have such concentration in a few names and all those companies are in the very similar tech and communication services sectors,” said Michael Landsberg, chief investment officer at Landsberg Bennett Private Wealth Management. “This concentration will drive broader market performance until it doesn’t.”According to Tejas Dessai, an analyst at Global X ETFs, the growing influence of big tech in major indexes puts passive investors at risk of over exposure. “However, it does help that these businesses are some of the most innovative names in the technology world and none are looking at a secular decline anytime soon,” he said.Apple and Microsoft alone have added more than $1 trillion in combined market value in 2023, nearly half of the gains for the entire S&P 500.The world’s biggest technology and internet firms have long dominated the benchmark index, but their statures were diminished in 2022 when soaring interest rates and slowing growth sent valuations tumbling. While the stocks remain well below peak levels, their outperformance this year relative to the market capitalization-weighted index is fueling their rising influence.The tech giants have benefited from a flight to the perceived safety of their cash-rich balance sheets amid bank turmoil. And they found a new source of momentum this week when Microsoft reported profit and sales that beat Wall Street estimates. Alphabet and Meta also exceeded expectations, helping send the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 Index up 3.4% for its best two-day advance in nearly three months and spurring optimism for next week’s report from Apple.The stock gains are pushing valuations to levels that Landsberg describes as extreme. Amazon leads the pack, trading at 38 times projected earnings, followed by Microsoft at 28 times and Apple with a multiple of 27. Alphabet and Meta are trading below 20 times forward earnings, but they are quickly gaining pace.Given their ever-increasing index weight, some now feel less than comfortable.“Regardless of which companies dominate an index, the more top-heavy it becomes the more risky it becomes as an investor,” said Dave Grecsek, managing director in investment strategy and research at Aspiriant LLC.Tech Chart of the DayCloudflare Inc. slumped as much as 27%, its biggest intraday drop ever, after the cybersecurity-focused software company cut its full-year guidance as sales cycles lengthen materially in the aftermath of the banking crisis.

Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Paypal is expected to post earnings of $1.18 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +26.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.1%.The consensus earnings estimate of $4.91 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +18.9%. This estimate has changed +0.1% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.67 indicates a change of +15.6% from what Paypal is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.1%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Paypal.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Paypal, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $7.26 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +6.7%. For the current and next fiscal years, $29.52 billion and $32.15 billion estimates indicate +7.3% and +8.9% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPaypal reported revenues of $7.04 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +8.6%. EPS of $1.17 for the same period compares with $0.88 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.99 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.69%. The EPS surprise was +6.36%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Paypal is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Paypal. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.PayPal Holdings, Inc.

PYPL,Best Inverse/Leveraged ETFs of Last Week,"Wall Street was mixed last week, with the S&P 500 losing about 0.3%, the Dow Jones falling about 1.1%, the Nasdaq Composite adding about 0.40% and the Russell 2000 shedding about 1.1%. While CPI and PPI inflation data showed signs of cooling (a positive for the stock market), the debt-ceiling drama in Washington posed a threat to the market.Against this backdrop, below, we highlight a few inverse/leveraged ETFs of last week.The payments’ giant cautioned that its adjusted operating margin won’t grow as quickly as the company had previously anticipated, even after spending on its platforms surged more than expected in the first quarter, per Bloomberg (read: PayPal ETFs to Dump on Weak Guidance?).Following a series of artificial intelligence announcements made by Alphabet at its I/O developer conference, the company witnessed a significant boost in its stock prices, with shares surging approximately 5% on Wednesday. This surge resulted in an overnight increase of $82 billion in Alphabet's overall market value. This helped drive leveraged Google ETF.Silver, too, suffered the same fate as gold. While the metal slumped due to the rising greenback, recessionary fears also weighed on the metal as silver is viewed as an important industrial metal.

PYPL,This week in tech: Google flexing AI muscle; PayPal takes it on the chin,"By Louis Juricic and Sarina IsaacsInvesting.com -- Here is your weekly Pro Recap on this past week's most momentous tech headlines: Alphabet's Google gets in the AI game; PayPal, Airbnb, and Twilio issue disappointing forecasts; and Zscaler has good news for investors.Artificial intelligence capabilities are being integrated into Google search, Gmail, and Google Photos, said Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) this past week at its annual I/O conference. The announcement comes in the aftermath of Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) headline-making venture into AI with that company's $10 billion investment in ChatGPT and its integration into the tech giant's Bing search product.The new Google search product, dubbed Search Generative Experience, would be able to verbally answer search queries alongside producing relevant links, and will be available via waitlist for U.S. customers over the coming weeks.Analysts were positive on the prospects for Alphabet here. Goldman Sachs said that it is...increasingly constructive on Alphabet's long-term strategic positioning in a number of key end markets and continue to see the company as the leading collection of AI/machine learning-driven businesses in our coverage universe.Jefferies wrote, regarding Alphabet's generative AI strategy: ""We see momentum accelerating, and monetization before year-end."" And Evercore ISI said Google has taken the AI gloves off and ""reminded everyone of how long it has been investing in, developing, and deploying AI capabilities across all of its offerings.""Alphabet shares gained 4% during the Wednesday session, when the conference took place, and were up nearly 12% for the week.PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) raised its full-year profit guidance, and first-quarter results topped expectations, but shares slumped on a lowered operating-margin outlook - from +125bps to +100bps - for the full year.Q1 earnings were $1.17 per share, better than the $1.10 average expectation, driven by cost cuts and an increase in new accounts. And sales of $7.04B edged past the consensus.Looking ahead, the company now expects to grow adjusted EPS by about 20% to $4.95 - up from prior guidance of 18% growth to $4.87.Credit Suisse said in a note:Given the prospects for continued transaction margin pressures throughout 2023 (partly mix driven), PayPal’s vertical skew (discretionary) in an uncertain macro backdrop, a pending management transition, and increasing competitive pressures (longer term), we find it challenging to recommend the shares at this time.And Oppenheimer believes PayPal stock ""may be stuck"" in the near term.PayPal shares crashed more than 18% for the week.Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) said it made $0.18 a share - a swing from last year's loss but also $0.02 shy of Street expectations - on in-line revenue of $1.8B. The company also announced a new share buyback program of up to $2.5B.Looking ahead to Q2, the company guided revenue in a range of $2.35B to $2.45B, in line with Wall Street estimates, but also said Night and Experiences Booked ""will have unfavorable year-over-year comparisons in Q2 2023 as we overlap pent-up 2022 demand following the COVID Omicron variant.""Slower-than-expected forward room night growth (US facing pricing and supply constraints) speak to how forward growth (more reliant on Europe, APAC, LATAM and new business opportunities) could face higher execution risk. Competitive risk (share loss to BKNG) also continues.Oppenheimer believes that the velocity of 2Q23 nights deceleration will heighten concerns about slowing growth:We maintain Perform on uncertain back-half outlook and premium valuation, 21x '23E EBITDA vs. BKNG's 15x, limiting NT upside to shares.Shares tumbled more than 14% for the week.Twilio (NYSE:TWLO) offered a soft Q2 revenue outlook, saying it expects EPS in the range of $0.27-$0.31, compared with the Wall Street consensus of $0.29. Revenue is seen at $980 million to $990M, missing the consensus estimate of $1.05B.Q1 EPS of $0.47 and revenue of $1.01 billion came in better than anticipated, but Q2 guidance disappointed investors.For the full year, the company expects non-GAAP income from operations in the range of $275M-$350M.Oppenheimer cut the stock's price target to $75, citing continued headwinds for Twilio. However, the analyst remains Buy-rated, saying, ""the risk/reward is positively skewed.""Bernstein also cut the stock's price target, going to $58:At this point we remain on the sidelines while waiting for more clarity on the rebound and future.Shares lost more than 14% for the week to $45.83.Zscaler (NASDAQ:ZS) shares surged more than 20% Monday after the company's preliminary Q3 results beat expectations: Its top line should be between $415M and $419M, well above the previous guidance range of $396 million to $398 million.In addition, the company's adjusted income from operations is far higher, now estimated to range between $60M and $64M.CEO Jay Chaudhry said the company ""had a strong finish to the quarter"" thanks to high ROI from its Zscaler Zero Trust Exchange platform.The cloud security company also now expects full-year revenue to range between $1.587B and $1.591B, above the previously forecast range of $1.558 billion to $1.563 billion.On the heels of that news, CFRA upped the stock to Strong Buy from Buy. Zscaler earnings are expected June 1.Shares were up 6.5% for the week.Sam Boughedda, Yasin Ebrahim, Senad Karaahmetovic, and Davit Kirakosyan contributed to this report.Related ArticlesThis week in tech: Google flexing AI muscle; PayPal takes it on the chinAmid banking woes, faltering US small-caps offer ominous economic signThis week in EVs: Tesla's lithium gambit, GM restructuring, TuSimple in trouble","May 14, 2023 at 3:18 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/week-tech-google-flexing-ai-081817717.html,Investing.com,0.0,0.0,0.13624242424242425,0.4607410468319561,2023-05-14 03:18:00,2023-05-14 03:18:00,,,
PYPL,How Much Cash To Have Stashed at Home at All Times,"McCarty framed it more in terms of a ratio: “In terms of amount, don’t let your cash exceed 10% of your overall emergency fund and/or $10,000. You can’t deposit more than $10,000 in cash in a given year without raising red flags with the IRS.”“You don’t need to stash hundreds of thousands of dollars because that’s just over-preparing for a catastrophe that has a really low chance of taking place,” Capwell said.“It depends person to person, but an amount less than $1,000 is almost always preferred. There simply isn’t enough good reason to keep large amounts of liquid cash lying around the house. Banks are infinitely safer.”To drive home this point, he shared that neighbors of his parents wound up badly burned in a house fire because they were trying to find their hidden stockpiles of cash.“This is an extreme example, but the point stands,” Cramer said. “In today’s world of ubiquitous credit cards, Apple pay, Paypal, Venmo, etc., there aren’t enough good reasons to keep large amounts of cash in the house.”No matter how much cash you keep at home, you’ll want to keep it safe, said Matthew Dailly, managing director at Tiger Financial. “To begin with, you’ll need to locate safe havens for it…The loss of a large amount of cash can happen in a matter of seconds if your home is damaged by a flood or fire. Fireproof safe storage is, therefore, a good idea. In addition, you’ll serve as a lure for would-be burglars…Even if you purchase a high-tech safe, a criminal may still attempt to break into your home.”For security purposes, this money should be kept in a bolted down safe with any other valuables in the home, McCarty said. “Make sure the safe is fire and waterproof to avoid any damage. Make sure you deposit and replace the money on occasion so that the bills don’t get too old.”Jay Zigmont, PhD, CFP®, founder of Childfree Wealth, a life and financial planning firm based in Mississippi, offers another word of caution: “Having money on hand, of course comes with the threat of theft or loss, but also, it may be a challenge for you to not spend it. I’ve heard of people freezing the money–literally–to slow them down, giving their spouse or child the key to the safe or other things to slow themselves down. Figure out a balance that works for you.”When things get bad, people have a tendency to panic, and taking out a lot of cash to protect against emergencies can actually work against you. Contrary to popular belief, you are already protected from a bank failure, Dailly said.If a bank goes under, the standard FDIC insurance is $250,000 per depositor, per insured bank, for each account. “To avoid a total collapse of the entire financial system at once, you can simply divide your fortune among several banks.”A good rule of thumb is to keep as little as you think is necessary; while it might seem weird, cash actually loses value over time. “Unlike money in circulation, which loses value over time, money in a bank retains its worth and, on occasion, even climbs in value. A safe financial institution is the only way to ensure the safety of your money,” Dailly said.More From GOBankingRates10 Aldi Brand Products Worth BuyingLearn To Master Your Money With These Financial Tips3 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,00048 Easy Things You Can Do To Live Better and Save Money","May 13, 2023 at 12:30 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/much-cash-keep-home-times-180337690.html,GOBankingRates,0.2,0.2,0.1004983200878723,0.4236733001658376,2023-05-13 12:30:00,2023-05-13 12:30:00,,,

We/ investors need to see sustainable underlying margin expansion given their scale.Deutsche Bank said the move lower in PYPL shares is a result of the investor focus on transaction margin pressures:Transaction margins are under pressure and will only begin to improve yoy if branded volumes rebounds (as share loss worries continue). As a result, we expect higher revenues to be fully offset by lower transaction margins.Shares were recently down some 12% for the week.Yasin Ebrahim, Davit Kirakosyan, and Senad Karaahmetovic contributed to this report.Related Articles3 big earnings hits: Disney falls down; Airbnb warns; PayPal 'may be stuck'Tesla to recall over 1.1 million foreign and China-made cars - Chinese regulatorToshiba says working with JIP to 'quickly complete' $15 billion buyout","May 11, 2023 at 10:00 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-big-earnings-hits-disney-030000992.html,Investing.com,-0.07777777777777779,0.19444444444444448,0.050375375375375384,0.46416188916188916,2023-05-11 22:00:00,2023-05-12 10:30:00,64.0999984741211,61.68999862670898,2.4099998474121165
PYPL,PayPal And Palantir Both Took The AI Plunge But Reactions Were Different,"With its first quarter results, PayPal was able to beat estimates on both lines. The revenue beat was not very meaningful but the 9% YoY growth was pleasing as the posted revenue amounted to $7.04 billion. The earnings beat was sizeable as first quarter profit amounted to $795 million, a net income of 70 cents per share with adjusted earnings being $1.17 per share. Despite the fact PayPal’s trajectory weakened compared to the pandemic boom that fueled online transactions, PayPal still showed solid business growth despite the e-commerce spending slowdown, as well as intensified competition in the digital payments field.Fortunately for PayPal, there seems to be plenty of room and potential in the digital payments space. Last year, online sales made only 15% of retail sales and that figure is expected to grow to 22% by 2025. PayPal raised its full year guidance despite the not so strong second quarter guidance. Yet, it did it by less than the market had anticipated, with a large part of the increased profitability coming from cutting staff and other costs. For the undergoing June quarter, PayPal expects EPS in the range between $1.15 to $1.17 while full-year earnings are guided at $4.95 per share.Full year adjusted operating margin is expected to expand 100 basis points, downsized after the prior forecast of 125-basis points growth.For the period ended on March 31st, Palantir’s revenue expanded 18% to $525 million while adjusted earnings amounted to 5 cents. On Monday after market close, Palantir reported it earned a GAAP net income of $17 million on the back of government revenue rising 20% to $289 million, which was in line with estimates, and commercial revenue from the private sector, that makes up about 40% of its total revenue, and that rose 15% to $236 million,topping expectations of 217 million, according to Investor’s Business Daily.The maker of data analytics software gave a relentlessly bright outlook as it included AI power into its projections. For the undergoing June quarter, Palantir guided for revenue of $530 million, below estimates of $537 million.Chief Executive Alex Karp believes the software maker is well-positioned to capitalize on AI developments, stating that the engagement and demand for the new AI Platform is without precedent, as the company works its way to convert this demand into an expanded reach.  First iteration will be available to selected customers as early as this month.A cloud over Palantir that could dim Palantir’s bright AI-owed prospects is the fact that despite its conscious effort to diversify its business across health care, energy and manufacturing sectors, government agencies still account for almost 60% of its revenue. This is no longer a stable revenue stream as it used to be, considering Congress’ recent spending cuts initiatives.Year to date and heading into the latest reported, Palantir stock rose 15% in 2023. On the other hand, PayPal tumbled 12% upon the report on Tuesday despite solid results and most likely due to a cut outlook for the adjusted operating margin.DISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

PYPL,PayPal ETFs to Dump on Weak Guidance?,"The payments giant cautioned that its adjusted operating margin won’t grow as quickly as the company previously anticipated, even after spending on its platforms surged more than expected in the first quarter, per Bloomberg.Deutsche Bank analysts said that transaction margins are presently under pressure and can improve year over year only on a rebound in branded volumes (as share loss concerns prevail). Hence, improved revenues are anticipated to be entirely offset by decreased transaction margins, per the analysts, as quoted on investing.com.The company came up with quarterly earnings of $1.17 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.10 per share helped by cost cuts and growth in e-commerce. This compares to earnings of $0.88 per share a year ago. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.Paypal, which belongs to the Zacks Internet - Software industry, posted revenues of $7.04 billion for the quarter ended March 2023, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.69%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $6.48 billion.The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters. Active accounts grew 1% for the quarter year over year, bringing total active accounts to 433 million. Total payment volume (TPV), a key measure of performance, rose 10%, to $354.5 billion.During the pandemic, PayPal amassed a lot of success as consumers shifted to online transactions, resulting in a surge in its revenues. PayPal revenues, for example, shot up from $17.8 billion in 2019 to more than $25 billion in 2021, per CNBC. Shares of the company also saw new heights during that period.However, as pandemic restrictions began to ease, PayPal's stock growth slowed down, leading to a series of disappointing earnings reports. The company's latest earnings report raised concerns among investors, due to a weak guidance.At the height of the pandemic, e-commerce sales accounted for 16.4% of total retail sales in the United States. Since then, the growth has largely slowed down, remaining under 15% the past two years. As the lockdowns ended, people returned to in-person spending. Some even went back to cash transactions, per analysts. Rising competition in the digital-payment space is another key contributing factor to the pain in the stock.For Q2, adjusted EPS was expected to grow 24% to 26% to $1.15 to $1.17 on revenue growth in a range of 6.5% to 7%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings growth was 26.88% and revenue growth was 6.37%.The company now expects adjusted EPS for the full year to grow by about 20% to $4.95, up  from the prior guidance of 18% growth to $4.87. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was $4.92.PayPal Holdings, Inc.

PYPL,PayPal stock drops following pivot to AI in cost-cutting strategy,"Yahoo Finance Live discussed a drop in PayPal stock as the company pivots its strategy to integrating AI in an attempt to cut costs.Actually, the numbers for the most recent quarter weren't that bad. They came in better than the Street was expecting in terms of some of the payment volume that we did see. But this is another tech company relying on AI, saying that how they're going to use that to their business to really boost their business down the line.And so when you take a look at sort of how to build that back and cut costs, one thing they turn to and mentioned was AI, which is interesting because they didn't specifically say it. But since IBM pointed out last week that AI might be able to replace some jobs and cut costs that way, I think you have some people sort of speculating here, well, if PayPal is going to use AI to significantly cut costs and make things more efficient, what exactly does that mean?Does that mean a decrease in headcount. Of course, it could. And I think that's where things got interesting there when you think about PayPal. But as you said, Seana, they didn't see really that volume decline. I know that's something we're going to be watching after the bell here when we think about a firm in the buy now, pay later space and if people are still buying, essentially.","May 9, 2023 at 3:19 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/paypal-stock-drops-following-pivot-201949836.html,Yahoo Finance Video,0.0,0.1,0.13966540404040403,0.39048611111111114,2023-05-09 15:19:00,2023-05-09 15:19:00,69.52999877929688,65.90499877929688,3.625

PYPL,"PayPal tumbles 12%, eyes lowest close since 2017","(Reuters) - PayPal Holdings' stock slumped 12% on Tuesday, on track for its lowest close in almost six years, after the payments company cut the outlook for its annual adjusted operating margin.The stock, last trading at $66.45, was set to record its lowest closing price since October 2017. It touched a session low of $66.39, its lowest intra-day price since December.PayPal late on Monday estimated adjusted operating margin expansion of 100 basis points this year, compared with its earlier forecast of 125-basis-point growth.The company is focusing on enterprise-focused unbranded checkouts, which are less profitable than its own branded checkout button.High inflation, rising interest rates and worries about a slowing economy have also discouraged consumer spending on big-ticket items.Affirm Holdings' shares jumped 4.4% on Tuesday ahead of the ""buy now, pay later"" platform's quarterly report after the bell, which could offer additional clues about the health of online spending.PayPal said in January it was cutting 7% of its workforce, or about 2,000 employees, joining several technology companies that have eliminated thousands of jobs this year.Its stock has fallen 7% in 2023, compared to a 17% rise in the Nasdaq Composite Index.(Reporting by Noel Randewich; Editing by Richard Chang)","May 9, 2023 at 2:08 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/paypal-tumbles-12-eyes-lowest-190836351.html,Reuters,0.0,0.0,-0.056666666666666664,0.38333333333333336,2023-05-09 14:08:00,2023-05-09 14:08:00,69.52999877929688,65.90499877929688,3.625

PYPL,"PayPal Earnings Review: A Strong Quarter, but Highly Competitive Industry","On Monday, May 8, after the market closed PayPal reported better than expected sales and earnings figures, beating analysts estimates. Total payment volume grew 10% YoY to $354.5 billion and EPS climbed 33% YoY to $1.17 per share. Management also raised guidance and announced that they expect to buy back $4 billion in shares by year end.Stock PerformancePayPal stock had been on a steady trajectory higher for several years, matching the returns of legacy competitor Visa. However, following the Covid pandemic PayPal skyrocketed as investors blindly bid up shares of growth and technology companies. But the stock subsequently crashed nearly -80% in 2022 and performance is now flat over the last five years.The stock seems to have put in a floor though and has been building a base over the last 12 months signaling investor interest again. Additionally, PYPL’s valuation is now as low as it has been since it was spun out into a public company in 2015.Industry LandscapeThe payments industry is in the midst of transformation. More than ever, transactions are becoming cashless, whether online or in person. Thus, the competition to capture that shift is vigorous.PayPal’s most direct competitor Block suffered an equally painful 2022, giving back five years of stock gains. Like PYPL, SQ is a rapidly growing company, with compelling products and a strong business model.The two compete in several business segments. Primarily, PayPal’s Venmo and Block’s CashApp, are direct competitors in peer-to-peer payments. Both are important contributors to topline growth as well as customer onboarding.ValuationPayPal is currently trading at a one-year forward earnings multiple of 20x, which is below its eight-year median of 44x, and just off its low of 19x. Because of PYPL’s historically low valuation it may become an acquisition target. As one of the most competitive industries in the market, and one that is laser focused on network effects, it might make sense for larger incumbents like Visa or Mastercard to come in and buy it.Bottom LinePayPal’s quarterly results showed continued strength in key metrics, yet it still wasn’t enough for investors. Shares are down more than -10% on Tuesday following the earnings call. Nonetheless, PYPL still has a compelling business model and is trading at a historically low valuation. PayPal has clearly carved out a niche in online payments, and continues to grow its secondary businesses, and whether it continues on its own, or is acquired it should continue to generate considerable value for investors.Bank of America Corporation (BAC) : Free Stock Analysis ReportJPMorgan Chase & Co.

PYPL,"PayPal, IBM turn to A.I. to cut costs","The evolving A.I. landscape, PayPal argues, will help the company operate more efficiently moving forward.“We expect A.I. will enable us to meaningfully lower our costs for years to come,” PayPal CEO Dan Schulman said on the company’s earnings call. “Furthermore, we believe that A.I., combined with our unique scale and sets of data, will drive not only efficiencies, but will also drive a differentiated and unique set of value propositions for our merchants and consumers.”Mentions of “A.I.” are up 64% year-over-year in earnings calls, per Bank of America research, but the use cases often vary.When asked on Monday’s earnings call how costs and operating expenses could be reduced beyond 2023, Schulman referred back to A.I.“You're going to see our costs continue to come down year-over-year-over-year,” Schulman said. “And this is not just about efficiencies, by the way.

PYPL,PayPal stock sinks on disappointing outlook for operating margins,"Yahoo Finance Live anchors Julie Hyman and Brad Smith discuss the decline in stock for PayPal.And it seems like macro is definitely a part of this, right, that there's just concern about spending overall for the year, that that's part of the issue for the company. I'm looking at a lot of the analyst recommendations, which are pretty mixed here. We did get a downgrade from Credit Suisse, which said it is challenging to recommend the shares here so-- that it's going to be challenging this year.And they were talking about that on the call and the Q1 operating margin performance, saying that was strong with about 2% worth of operating margin expansion. However, kind of looking out through the rest of the year, Q3, they expect to see some pressure on operating margin, some slight pressure. And then in Q4, they're looking to see some expansion again but modest expansion, more modest expansion than we have seen on a comparative basis there. So that perhaps catching the eye of some of the analysts covering that this morning too.","May 9, 2023 at 8:46 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/paypal-stock-sinks-disappointing-outlook-134648267.html,Yahoo Finance Video,-0.35,0.35,0.2586715367965368,0.6178571428571429,2023-05-09 08:46:00,2023-05-09 08:46:00,69.52999877929688,65.90499877929688,3.625

PYPL,"For Netflix, a Poorer Consumer Isnt Necessarily Bad","(Bloomberg) -- For Netflix Inc., a mild deterioration in the consumer economy is a potential blessing in disguise.Most Read from BloombergVanguard’s Trillion-Dollar Man Leads a Fixed-Income RevolutionTrump Liable for Sex Abuse, Must Pay $5 Million to CarrollGoldman to Pay $215 Million to End Case on Underpaying WomenItaly Intends to Exit China Belt and Road Pact as Relations SourUS Stocks Slump Before Inflation Report; Dollar Up: Markets WrapTo start with, the less money people have, the more likely they are to stay home, where movie-streaming became such a popular form of entertainment during the pandemic.Then there’s the impact on competitors who have been striving to make inroads into Netflix’s lead. Having plowed big money into streaming services in recent years, the likes of Walt Disney Co. and Paramount Global are now making cuts in the area, deterred by the tougher conditions.Streaming viewership “should pick up nicely” as people stop going out if the economy slips into a recession later this year, said Matthew Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak + Co. LLC. And Netflix should “definitely be a beneficiary of the fact that their competition is focusing more on profitability.”That view is gaining traction on Wall Street. UBS Group AG analyst John Hodulik upgraded the stock to buy last month, saying the sharp change in the priorities of rivals will drive upside to subscription and pricing power in the coming years while “also keeping a lid on content costs.”In general, analysts have been turning more positive on Netflix. About 54% of those tracked by Bloomberg have a buy or equivalent rating, the highest percentage in about a year. That’s even though streaming services tend to be one of the first things consumers cut back on during an economic downturn.Having underperformed rivals so far this year, the stock could certainly use a boost. It’s been weighed down in part by Netflix’s crackdown on password-sharing in some regions. That follows a rollercoaster 2022 in which it sank to a near five-year low before rallying sharply. Shares of Netflix were trading 0.5% higher on Tuesday.Trading at 27 times forward earnings, the stock is much cheaper than its 10-year average of 77 times, though still more expensive than Disney’s 21 times and Paramount’s 16 times, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Netflix has seen its dominance of the streaming industry wane in the last five years as the likes of Disney+, Apple TV+ and Paramount+ make inroads. Its global share of the market for “streaming originals” was 38% at the end of the last quarter, down from 60% at the end of first quarter of 2018, according to data from Parrot Analytics.Not that competitors are having an easy time. Paramount Global shares plunged last week as losses from its streaming business led the media company to slash costs and its dividend. Warner Bros. Discovery Inc. reported a surprise profit in streaming TV, a rare chink of light for a company which has struggled to generate profit from its multibillion-dollar investments.Attention will turn to Disney’s earnings after markets close Wednesday to see if the company plans any further cost cuts on top of the 7,000 job cuts it already announced. While the layoffs have hit every division, they have been particularly acute in streaming.“While there may be several winners in streaming in the long run, competitive weakness from peers will only propel Netflix forward in the short term,” said Tejas Dessai, an analyst at Global X ETFs.Tech Chart of the DayThe Nasdaq Composite Index has risen 20% from a December closing low, taking the gauge beyond the threshold that is considered the start of a new bull market. The index gained 0.2% on Monday, closing at its highest since September, and is up 17% this year.

PYPL,Futures on shaky ground after disappointing earnings forecasts,"By Carolina Mandl and Caroline ValetkevitchNEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stock indexes closed lower on Tuesday as investors grew more cautious ahead of a U.S. consumer price index report and a meeting between U.S. political leaders to discuss the debt ceiling.Investors will look for clues on whether inflation is continuing to ease following the Labor Department's consumer price index (CPI) report on Wednesday.Talks over the U.S. debt ceiling are adding to caution in the market as traders were also waiting for an update on plans for the debt ceiling from a meeting between U.S. President Joe Biden, Republican House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and other congressional leaders at the White House.Worries of a potential government default loom over Washington as early as June 1, if Congress does not act to resolve the deadlock.""Overall, it's a relatively mild day, but both the debt ceiling as well as the inflation are causing some anxiety,"" said Randy Frederick, managing director of trading and derivatives at the Schwab Center for Financial Research.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 56.88 points, or 0.17%, to 33,561.81, the S&P 500 lost 18.95 points, or 0.46%, to 4,119.17 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 77.36 points, or 0.63%, to 12,179.55.Volume on U.S. exchanges was 9.35 billion shares, compared with the 10.68 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.Disappointing forecasts from companies such as PayPal and Apple supplier Skyworks also weighed on the mood. They were down 12.73% and 5.15%, respectively.Shares of PayPal Holdings dropped and pressured the benchmark S&P 500 after the company cut its margin forecast.

PYPL,Lowered margin growth expectations push PayPal shares lower despite Q1 beat,"Investing.com -- PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) raised its full-year profit guidance after reporting Monday its first quarter results that topped expectations, driven by cost cuts and growth in e-commerce.Still, PayPal shares trade 4.5% lower in pre-market Tuesday after the company lowered its operating margin outlook from +125bps to +100bps for the full year.The beat on the bottom line was driven by cost cuts and an increase in new accounts.Active accounts grew 1% for the quarter year-on-year, bringing total active accounts to 433 million.Total payment volume (TPV), a key measure of performance, rose 10%, to $354.5B.For Q2, adjusted EPS was expected to grow 24% to 26% to $1.15 to $1.17 on revenue growth in a range of 6.5% to 7%.The company attributed the boost to guidance to the ""ongoing benefit from cost initiatives.""Oppenheimer analysts believe PayPal stock ""may be stuck"" in the near term.""We get the strategic value of Braintree, but investors will ask; how long can you cut expenses to offset profitability declines which impact valuation? Meaningful PPCP profitability help is likely quarters/years away. Thus, revenue growth likely slower than TPV. We/ investors need to see sustainable underlying margin expansion given their scale,"" the analysts said in a client note.Deutsche Bank analysts said the move lower in PYPL shares is a result of the investor focus on transaction margin pressures.""Transaction margins are under pressure and will only begin to improve yoy if branded volumes rebounds (as share loss worries continue).

Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Paypal: mixed.

Revenue missed the Street's expectations, also production guidance coming in at the low end of the year.It now expects to make 18,000 vehicles this year. They'd initially guided for 14,000 vehicles-- so a reduction there. Obviously, one of the things that is weighing on the stock.

PYPL,PayPal stock falls despite Q1 earnings beat,"The Yahoo Finance Live team discusses Paypal's Q1 earnings, job cuts, and its boosted forecast for full-year profits.And I think that specifically is a result of what they had to say about the current quarter. Second quarter adjusted EPS is at the low end of the range of $1.15 to $1.17. The Street was looking for $1.17 here. So that could be one of the reasons why the stock is under pressure here in extended trading.But again, for the quarter, it was a pretty solid number here from PayPal. Their total payment volume was up 10% on a year over year basis. They also boosted their full year profit guidance here, which may have caught some on the Street by surprise, given the fact that so many consumers have been pulling back a bit on their spending-- or we were expected to see a larger pullback on spending in Q1.And we also want to point out that PayPal did cut 2,000 workers-- announced now its plans to cut 2,000 workers, citing that macro slowdown, needing to make some adjustments here to their business given the fact that we are seeing a broader slowdown here. But PayPal, again, shares, Akiko, under pressure, off just about 4%. I think a lot of that has to do with what they're planning to see or what they expect to see in the current quarter adjusted EPS.","May 8, 2023 at 3:53 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/paypal-stock-falls-despite-q1-205340102.html,Yahoo Finance Video,0.0,0.0,0.08741258741258741,0.41538461538461546,2023-05-08 15:53:00,2023-05-08 15:53:00,75.70999908447266,75.5199966430664,0.19000244140625

PYPL,"PayPal raises full-year profit above estimates on e-commerce strength, cost cuts","May 8 (Reuters) -PayPal Holdings Inc on Monday raised its annual profit forecast to above Wall Street estimates, buoyed by its higher quarterly profit as margins improved on cost-cut measures and as consumers undeterred by inflationary pressures keep shopping online.While a cost-of-living crisis has now begun to squeeze budgets, particularly of lower income households, consumer spending has remained remarkably steady in the face of a looming economic slowdown.The company's payments volume rose 12% on a forex-neutral basis to $354.5 billion in the first-quarter ended March 31.The upbeat forecast echoes expectations of card giants Visa and Mastercard that have remained largely upbeat about spending volumes on pent-up travel demand and resilient consumer spending.The company said it now expects full-year adjusted profit to grow about 20% to $4.95 per share, above analysts' average estimate of $4.88 per share, according to Refinitiv IBES data.The company has said in the past that it is focused on lowering expenses with executives cautioning that inflation was impacting discretionary consumer spending.Adjusted operating margin in the first-quarter came in at 22.7% compared with 20.7% last year.The payments firm said in January it would lay off 7% of its workforce, or about 2,000 employees in the backdrop of a high interest rate environment that has exacerbated fears around an upcoming recession.PayPal's revenue rose 10% on a forex-neutral basis to $7.04 billion in the first-quarter.The payments firm earned a profit of $1.17 per share on an adjusted basis in first-quarter, compared with 88 cents last year.PayPal was one of the biggest winners during the COVID pandemic when people locked at home used its platform while shopping online.

PYPL,Time to Invest in the Growth of FinTech?,"Defined as new technology that seeks to improve and automate the delivery and use of financial services, the financial technology (fintech) market is forecasted to be valued at around $700 billion by 2030 with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 20%.PayPal’s RevolutionAs a brief synopsis, fintech companies strive to simplify and digitalize banking services, payment processing, peer-to-peer lending and payments, financial software, and other financial services.Despite giving back some of the gains since its 2015 IPO, PayPal stock is still up +94%. This has trailed the Nasdaq but is near the S&P 500’s performance and outperformed its former parent company eBay.PayPal has become one of the largest online payment solution providers and is responsible for making the process much easier for consumers during its early eBay days and the rise of the internet. Prior to this, the frequent use of mailed in checks to pay for purchased items on the internet became time insensitive, outdated, and incompatible with online purchases.Although there is increasing competition, PayPal’s growth story is far from over. Based on Zacks estimates PayPal’s earnings are forecasted to jump 18% in FY23 and climb another 16% in FY24 at $5.69 per share.More impressive, fiscal 2024 would represent a very stellar 132% growth in EPS since the pandemic with 2019 earnings at $2.45 per share. PayPal’s top-line expansion also supports its earnings potential with sales forecasted to rise 6% this year and jump another 9% in FY24 to $31.85 billion.Trading at $72 per share and 14.5X forward earnings, Wall Street's concerns of a high premium being paid for PayPal stock have faded. Better still, PayPal now offers a 45% discount to its industry average of 41.1X forward earnings and trades nicely beneath the S&P 500’s 18.8X.Quieting the premium fears in recent years, PayPal now trades 83% below its decade-long high of 87.8X and at a 67% discount to the median of 43.7X.PayPal’s ability to reconfirm its anticipated annual growth in its upcoming first quarter report on May 8 will be key for more upside in PYPL stock. With that being said, holding on to shares at current levels appears to be a keen way to get in on fintech expansion.Visa & Mastercard’s Transformation Newer start-up companies are often thought of in regards to fintech more so than these payment card giants but their impact on financial technology services shouldn’t be overlooked. This is especially true when considering Visa & Mastercard’s reliability to consumers and their very strong stock performances over the last decade.Furthermore, innovation and expansion in the fintech space is a way for Visa and Mastercard to continue their growth as larger mature companies.Specifically, Visa and Mastercard have to be recognized as their solutions in the digital wallet are as widely accepted for online shopping as their debit and credit cards are globally. Through Visa Checkout and MasterCard’s MasterPass, both companies have transformed themselves outside of plastic and evolved with the trend and digital age of consumer shopping.This should help preserve and expand their top and bottom line figures for years to come. Trading at $354 a share, Mastercard sales are forecasted to rise 13% this year to $25.16 billion with earnings expected to climb 15% at $12.26 per share. Fiscal 2024 sales and earnings are anticipated to jump another 12% and 17% respectively.   Pivoting to Visa which trades at $225 a share, earnings are expected to be up 14% in FY23 at $8.57 per share with sales rising 11% this year to $32.47 billion. Fiscal 2024 sales and earnings are projected to rise another 11% and 13% respectively.Block & Bitcoin  Block's Square Reader has been influential for smoother person-to-person transactions and has assisted small business owners in simplifying the payment process along with its larger Square Register.Outside of hardware products, Block's cash app has been innovative regarding money transfers with the company also implementing banking, lending, and bitcoin trading to its online platform.Trading at $60 a share and still up +370% since going public, Block’s performance has easily topped the broader indexes during this period. Block has intentionally stuck with solely providing Bitcoin services on its platform while other fintech companies such as PayPal include trading for a variety of cryptocurrencies.Block’s sole emphasis on Bitcoin is that it's still the most-traded cryptocurrency and the company’s concentration may provide larger returns rather than diversifying at the moment. To that point, along with providing bitcoin trading Block has entered the crypto mining space as a manufacturer of bitcoin chips.Notably, bitcoin prices have stabilized in recent months and Block may be a less expensive way to get concentrated exposure while also offering the diversification of its other financial services.Bitcoin derives about 50% of Block’s revenue with SQ stock landing a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at the moment. As Block continues its course of increased profitability more upside could be ahead with earnings projected to soar 63% in FY23 at $1.63 per share compared to EPS of $1.00 in 2022. Plus, fiscal 2024 EPS is forecasted to climb another 41%.  TakeawayThese companies are great illustrations of how the growth in financial technology services should intrigue investors. Considering the CAGR of the fintech market is +20%, there should be plenty of upside and growth for PayPal, Visa, Mastercard, and Block stock.  Mastercard Incorporated (MA) : Free Stock Analysis ReportVisa Inc.

PYPL,We Were Victims of Financial Scams: Here Are Our Stories,"According to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), consumers reported losing nearly $8.8 billion to fraud in 2022 — a staggering 30% increase over 2021.About 2.4 million people submitted fraud reports to the FTC last year, and two of the five most commonly reported scams involved online shopping and investment swindles.“I was once a victim of a forex trading scam that cost me thousands of dollars,” he said. “It all started when I received a direct message from a smooth-talking forex trader who promised me huge returns on my investment. We had met on Instagram, where he was running a trading company and would invest on behalf of his clients. He was so convincing that I decided to give it a shot and invested a significant amount of money into his trading platform.”At first, things seemed to be going well. Jason received regular updates on his profits, which were hefty enough to lull him into complacency.“I was thrilled with the returns I was seeing,” he said.Then, when he tried to withdraw those profits, it all came crashing down.“The trader suddenly became unresponsive and my emails and calls went unanswered,” Jason said. “It was then that I realized that I had been scammed.”Jason chose not to elaborate on how many thousands he lost, only that it was a “significant” amount of money.“And to make matters worse, I was unable to recover any of it,” he said. “I felt angry and helpless, and I couldn’t believe that I had fallen for such a scam. I had always been cautious with my money, but this experience taught me to be even more careful.”Jason lost enough in the fraud that he had to downsize his lifestyle in order to recover.“I had to cut back on my spending and learn to live with less,” he said. “It was a tough lesson, but it made me realize that I needed to be more careful with my finances. I also learned to research any investment opportunities thoroughly before making any decisions.”Overall, the experience was a painful one, but it taught him valuable lessons about financial responsibility and the importance of being cautious when it comes to investing.“I will always remember the pain of losing my hard-earned money,” he said, “but I will also use this experience to help me make better financial decisions in the future.”eBay scams are so common that the company’s security center has an entire page dedicated to helping shoppers stay safe and recognize the many clone sites, imposter emails and fake listings designed to steal their money.“I was so excited when I found a great deal on eBay for a brand-new laptop for just $700,” he said. “The seller had good reviews and was offering free shipping, so I jumped at the opportunity and used PayPal to complete the transaction.”However, as the days passed with no package, Chen started to get anxious.“My laptop still hadn’t arrived, and the seller wasn’t responding to any of my messages,” he said.It didn’t take long for Chen to realize he had fallen prey to a classic eBay fake-seller scam.“I had lost $700, and I was devastated,” he said. “I felt stupid for falling for such a scam, but I knew I had to take action. I immediately contacted PayPal to report the scam and provide them with evidence of the seller’s fraudulent behavior.”Chen turned out to be luckier than Jason. PayPal was able to reverse the transaction and get his money back.“It was a huge relief, but it also made me realize how important it is to be careful when shopping online,” Chen said. “Now, I always make sure to research sellers thoroughly before making any purchases. I also became more aware of the potential risks of shopping on eBay and other online marketplaces. I now make sure to double-check seller ratings and reviews, as well as ensure that the seller has a good track record of shipping products promptly and without issue.”Although PayPal made him whole, the experience was a tough pill to swallow.“I am grateful that I was able to recover my money, but I know that not everyone is as lucky,” Chen said. “It’s essential to take precautions and do your research to avoid falling victim to these types of scams.”More From GOBankingRates5 Expensive Renovations Homeowners Always RegretFinancial Insight in Your Inbox: Sign Up for GBR's Daily Newsletter3 Ways to Recession Proof Your Retirement7 Things You Must Do To Create a Plan for Your Money","May 3, 2023 at 6:00 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/were-victims-financial-scams-stories-130039704.html,GOBankingRates,0.0,0.0,0.10501770956316415,0.5409340659340658,2023-05-03 18:00:00,2023-05-03 18:00:00,72.41000366210938,71.43000030517578,0.9800033569335938

PYPL,Looking for Stocks with Positive Earnings Momentum? Check Out These 2 Computer and Technology Names,"Earnings are arguably the most important single number on a company's quarterly financial report. Wall Street clearly dives into all of the other metrics and management's input, but the EPS figure helps cut through all the noise.The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report. The idea is relatively intuitive as a newer projection might be based on more complete information. The ESP is calculated by comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with the percentage difference between the two giving us the Zacks ESP figure.Paypal's Earnings ESP sits at 2.15%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $1.12 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.09.Slated to report earnings on July 27, 2023, Carrier Global holds a #3 (Hold) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $0.77 a share 85 days from its next quarterly update.For Carrier Global, the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.76 is 0.66%.PYPL and CARR's positive ESP metrics may signal that a positive earnings surprise for both stocks is on the horizon.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

PYPL,"Enfusion, Inc. (ENFN) Q1 Earnings Preview: What's in the Cards?","Wall Street expects flat earnings compared to the year-ago quarter on higher revenues when Enfusion, Inc. (ENFN) reports results for the quarter ended March 2023. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on May 9. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.03 per share in its upcoming report, which represents no change from the year-ago quarter.Revenues are expected to be $42.27 million, up 23.8% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 4% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Enfusion, Inc.For Enfusion, Inc.The Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -5.26%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #1.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Enfusion, Inc. Will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Enfusion, Inc. Would post earnings of $0.03 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.03, delivering no surprise.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Enfusion, Inc. Doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerPaypal (PYPL), another stock in the Zacks Internet - Software industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $1.09 for the quarter ended March 2023. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of +23.9%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $6.98 billion, up 7.7% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Paypal has been revised 0.1% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a higher Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 2.15%.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggests that Paypal will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Enfusion, Inc.

PYPL,Paypal (PYPL) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,"Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Paypal (PYPL) reports results for the quarter ended March 2023. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on May 8, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis technology platform and digital payments company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.09 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +23.9%.Revenues are expected to be $6.98 billion, up 7.7% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.08% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Paypal?For Paypal, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +2.15%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Paypal will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Paypal would post earnings of $1.20 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.24, delivering a surprise of +3.33%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Paypal appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAnother stock from the Zacks Internet - Software industry, Fortinet (FTNT), is soon expected to post earnings of $0.28 per share for the quarter ended March 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +47.4%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $1.2 billion, up 25.7% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Fortinet has been revised 0.9% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.01%.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Fortinet will beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.PayPal Holdings, Inc.

PYPL,"Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights: Global X MSCI Argentina ETF, iShares MSCI Mexico ETF, StoneCo, Paypal and MercadoLibre","Chicago, IL – May 1, 2023 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Global X MSCI Argentina ETF ARGT, iShares MSCI Mexico ETF EWW, StoneCo STNE, Paypal PYPL and MercadoLibre MELI.As investors, our job is to look for opportunities wherever they may arise. Though domestic equities provide ample opportunity, it is also worth focusing on emerging markets as well. Firstly, investors may find benefits to tracking emerging markets because they are earlier in their growth trajectory.In other words, even though the companies may be smaller in size, their growth potential is often higher. Secondly, emerging markets provide investors with a means of diversification. If your entire portfolio is too concentrated in one market, an adverse price move in the wrong direction could devastate your portfolio.Investing in ETFs is the most straightforward way to participate in Latin America’s economic development. ETFs are useful for investors because they eliminate single stock risk, are highly liquid, and save investors time researching individual companies.Another way to find opportunities in LATAM is to look for companies that are mirroring the success already achieved by similar companies in the United States.Unlike the U.S. market, which is saturated with digital payment companies, Brazil’s market is largely untapped. As Brazil’s economy develops, more and more of its citizens will begin using digital payments. Though most payments are still conducted in cash, the shift is starting into the digital world, and it is showing up in STNE’s earnings and earnings estimate picture.Last quarter, EPS swung to a profit of $0.14 per share versus a loss the year before. Meanwhile, revenue jumped a healthy 52%. In the past 60 days, the Consensus Estimate Trend has been revised higher more than once for the next quarter and the full year.The Zacks Internet – Software Industry that STNE is in has been outperforming the market and is ranked in the top 27% of all groups tracked.STNE checks all the boxes. First, since the company is international, it aids investors in gaining portfolio diversification. Secondly, the stock is showing strong relative strength. Over the past month, STNE is up by 30%, drastically outperforming the 3% gain in the S&P 500 Index.From a technical perspective, the stock is trying to break over a key zone which it has failed at several times in the past. However, the recent relative strength coupled with the strong expectations going forward gives me confidence that this break-out will stick. If the stock can get and stay above the $12.50-$13 zone there is a ton of room to run.See Stocks Free >>Media ContactZacks Investment Research800-767-3771 ext. 9339support@zacks.comhttps://www.zacks.comPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

PYPL,New Venmo feature lets users transfer crypto to outside walletsand to each other,"Venmo soon will allow users to transfer their Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash to outside wallets—as well as to other users of the popular payment app.Crypto transfers on Venmo will be irreversible, just like crypto transactions more broadly—a function of cryptocurrency’s use of blockchains, or immutable public ledgers. To roll out the transfer system, PayPal is partnering with Paxos, a crypto firm that specializes in stablecoins.“We’re excited to connect Venmo’s customers to the community, other wallets and exchanges, and we intend to continue to roll out additional crypto products and services in the year ahead,” PayPal said in its statement.Before the onset of Crypto Winter and the recent regulatory crackdown on the industry, PayPal was one of the more public crypto boosters among legacy fintech firms.In October 2020, the company announced that U.S. users of PayPal would be able to buy, hold, and sell Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin.

PYPL,Apple Pay Later won't affect us for years: Klarna CEO,"Where Siemiatkowski is worried about competition is startups, not tech giants. “It's the startups and the new people coming with new, great ideas moving at super slight speed.

Like, I just-- I think-- I don't want to be arrogant to big companies' abilities to be competitive, but they're also-- if you look at Buy Now, Pay Later, with Apple right now and Apple Pay Later, it's actually-- while, obviously, I love Apple Pay-- in store, it works amazingly well. But if you look at the top 100 US retailers, more people offer Klarna now, those in the US, than offer Apple Pay.I'm not talking about Apple Pay Later. In order to use Apple Pay Later, you Also have to sign up for it. It only works on Safari. It doesn't work in Chrome. It only works on an iPhone. It doesn't work on your desktop. I mean, there's so many limitations that it will take years before this product has any potential significant impact on what we're doing.And to us, Buy Now, Pay Later, is just a feature. I think the strongest and most fantastic thing about Klarna is on every transaction we process, we carry SKU level data. When you shop with us at Macy's, we can show you not only that you bought for $100, exactly images of the items that you bought and the sizes, and the colors.And in this AI-powered world that we're going, this data and the fact that consumers are sharing this data with us is creating fantastic opportunities to match consumers to new brands, to new businesses and providing them an even better way to save money, save time, make them less worried about their finances. So it's like, I think that the-- that's really the key thing that media misses on Klarna is SKU level data.There's no other network out there-- Visa, Mastercard, none of them has this network on the rails, and that's creating for us unique opportunity. Buy Now, Pay Later, is a fantastic feature. It's grown a lot of interest. But for me, Klarna is so much more than that. And if Apple Pay Later becomes the buy-now, pay-later offer, sure, fine. But that doesn't solve that Apple doesn't have access to SKU level.","April 27, 2023 at 4:56 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/apple-pay-later-wont-affect-215601009.html,Yahoo Finance Video,0.0,0.0,0.20947227375798805,0.5042924998282141,2023-04-27 16:56:00,2023-04-27 16:56:00,73.0,74.2699966430664,-1.2699966430664062
PYPL,11 Best Gig Economy Stocks To Invest In,"Gig economy seems to be one of the most anti-fragile industries since it experiences growth even during the most difficult times. The online freelancing market saw a huge boost during the pandemic, when millions of workers were either laid off or were forced to work from home. These workers found new possibilities of making money using freelancing platforms like Upwork and Fiverr. The next downturn came in 2022 amid rising inflation and the Federal Reserve’s policy of increasing interest rates. As inflation started to bite people’s paychecks and eat into savings, millions of people sought to find side hustles for extra income.“We find that, upon probing, roughly one in 10 workers who initially reports working for an employer on one or more jobs (and thus is coded as an employee) is in fact an independent contractor on at least one of those jobs. Incorporating these miscoded workers into estimates of work arrangement on the main job nearly doubles the share who are independent contractors, to about 15 percent of all workers. Young workers, less-educated workers, workers of color, multiple-job holders, and those with low hours are more likely to be miscoded. Taking these workers into account substantively changes the demographic profile of the independent contractor workforce. Our research indicates that probing in household surveys to clarify a worker’s employment arrangement and identify all low-hours work is critical for accurately measuring independent contractor work.”The rise of online freelancing platforms like Upwork Inc. (UPWK) and Fiverr International Ltd (NYSE:FVRR) has allowed millions of people to find gigs to supplement their income. Many are finding full-time jobs on these platforms as well. Upwork Inc. (UPWK) published a study back in December 2022 which shows the stunning impact of these freelancing platforms on the overall economy and also the importance of gig economy. Upwork Inc. (UPWK) said that its study of US workforce showed that a whopping 60 million Americans performed freelance work in the past 12 months. This is 39% of the entire US workforce.American freelancers contributed an astounding $1.35 trillion in annual earnings to the U.S. economy, $50 billion more than in 2021.Impact of Gig Economy on Labor Market“Public perception is that people take on multiple jobs when the economy is bad because they’re not earning enough in their job. People take on additional jobs when there are additional jobs to be had.”For this article we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 943 hedge funds and picked 11 companies operating in the gig economy space. Most of these companies are operating platforms that allow people to buy and sell services online. Some of these companies play a key role in the gig economy and benefit from the activity taking place in the industry. Some notable names in the list include Uber Technologies Inc (NYSE:UBER), PayPal Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:PYPL) and Upwork Inc (NASDAQ:UPWK).11. Rover Group Inc (NASDAQ: ROVR)Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 15Rover Group Inc (NASDAQ:ROVR) is an online marketplace to buy and sell pet care services.

PYPL,Factors to Note Ahead of Paycom's (PAYC) Q1 Earnings Release,"The company projects revenues between $443 million and $445 million for the first quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $444.2 million, indicating an increase of 25.7% year over year. The consensus mark for earnings is pegged at $2.34 per share, suggesting a 23.2% rise from the prior-year quarter.Paycom estimates adjusted EBITDA in the range of $210-$212 million in the quarter to be reported. The company’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 11.6%.Paycom Software, Inc. Price and EPS SurprisePaycom Software, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Paycom Software, Inc. QuotePaycom’s first-quarter performance is likely to have benefited from strong demand for latest products, new business wins and the high-margin recurring revenue business. The company’s employee usage strategy, sales efforts and investments might have contributed to sales growth in the quarter to be reported.The cloud-based human capital management solution provider earlier announced its intention to aggressively drive advertising and marketing efforts to generate more demo leads, virtual meetings and increased close rates of deals. This is likely to have led to market share gains for Paycom.The company expects strong adoption of BETI solution, an industry-first technology that empowers employees to do their payroll among clients, aiding them to avoid time-consuming manual checks. We anticipate new client additions to have driven the top line in the first quarter.However, Paycom’s quarterly performance is expected to have been affected by macroeconomic uncertainty-triggered economic and business disruptions, which might have hurt the headcount across its client base. Enterprises are postponing their large IT spending plans due to the weakening global economy amid ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical issues.Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Paycom this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. However, that’s not the case here.PAYC has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #3 at present.

PYPL,Will Paypal (PYPL) Beat Estimates Again in Its Next Earnings Report?,"Have you been searching for a stock that might be well-positioned to maintain its earnings-beat streak in its upcoming report? It is worth considering Paypal (PYPL), which belongs to the Zacks Internet - Software industry.This technology platform and digital payments company has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 8.51%.For the last reported quarter, Paypal came out with earnings of $1.24 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.20 per share, representing a surprise of 3.33%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $0.95 per share and it actually produced earnings of $1.08 per share, delivering a surprise of 13.68%.Price and EPS SurpriseFor Paypal, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Paypal currently has an Earnings ESP of +2.15%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on May 8, 2023.When the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

PYPL,"PayPal Holdings, Inc. (PYPL) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It","Over the past month, shares of this technology platform and digital payments company have returned -1.3%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +2.6% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Software industry, which Paypal falls in, has lost 1.9%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Paypal is expected to post earnings of $1.09 per share, indicating a change of +23.9% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.3% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.90 points to a change of +18.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.4%.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.69 indicates a change of +16% from what Paypal is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.6%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Paypal.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Paypal, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $6.98 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +7.6%. For the current and next fiscal years, $29.2 billion and $31.82 billion estimates indicate +6.1% and +9% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPaypal reported revenues of $7.38 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +6.7%. EPS of $1.24 for the same period compares with $1.11 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.4 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.24%. The EPS surprise was +3.33%.Over the last four quarters, Paypal surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Paypal is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Paypal. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.PayPal Holdings, Inc.

PYPL,Can a CBDC be truly private? An ACLU technology expert weighs in,"Crypto is filled with contentious acronyms. The newest front has emerged around CBDCs, or central bank digital currencies—a kind of government-backed alternative to cryptocurrencies, such as the Bahamian Sand Dollar or the Nigerian eNaira. Digital payments are here to stay, whether offered through services like Venmo and PayPal, decentralized blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum, or government-backed projects like CBDCs, and the only question is which future wins out.The American Civil Liberties Union has also emerged as a critic. I spoke with Jay Stanley, a senior policy analyst focused on speech, privacy, and technology, who explained that CBDCs could serve as a public good with digital payments surging in popularity, although achieving that balance will be nearly impossible to pull off.As crypto advocates have long argued, cash is the only truly private means of payment. Its physical nature means anyone can access it and transact with it, with the only limits being availability and volume. Bitcoin emerged as a digital alternative, but governments and private firms have devised methods to track even privacy-focused cryptocurrencies like Zcash and Monero.As Stanley told me, a well-executed CBDC should mimic the properties of physical cash, meaning it would be fully accessible and untraceable. He acknowledged the government’s interest in tracking larger transactions to prevent money laundering, but he said the KYC requirements for CBDCs should only kick in at higher thresholds, as they do with cash—an arguably outdated $10,000 limit set in the 1970s.“When you're talking about ordinary people and ordinary transactions, we don't think that the tentacles of the government's surveillance infrastructure should reach down to that level,” he said.If that sounds like a pipe dream, you're right. Even so, with the country barreling toward a future that disincentivizes cash in favor of digital transactions controlled by corporations, Stanley argues that we should at least be pushing the government in the right direction—a more practical view than those held by Emmer and DeSantis, who want to ban CBDCs altogether. As he put it, there is a war on cash by credit card companies and other financial firms, but we should proactively make sure that cash equivalents remain an option.What an ideal CBDC would look like is unclear, especially for people without bank accounts. Stanley said it could entail a combination of cryptographic techniques like zero-knowledge proofs that mask transaction data, as well as ledger-based systems held by the Treasury Department or the Federal Reserve.“This is something that could be a real value for our economy and society if it were done right,” Stanley said.What do you think?

ATVI,Microsoft says China approves its plan to buy video game-maker Activision Blizzard,"Microsoft said Friday that China has unconditionally approved its plan to buy video game company Activision Blizzard, even as the deal still faces antitrust opposition in the U.S. and United Kingdom.China and the European Union are the two biggest economies to have approved Microsoft's planned $69 billion takeover of the California game publisher behind popular titles such as World of Warcraft, Call of Duty and Candy Crush.China’s State Administration for Market Regulation cleared it without conditions, according to Microsoft, though as of late Friday the agency's website didn't mention the decision.Game sales in mainland China come with a requirement that game-makers work with a Chinese publisher to release titles in the country. And since earlier this year, popular Activision Blizzard franchises such as World of Warcraft, the StarCraft series, Overwatch and Diablo have been suspended because of a disagreement between Activision subsidiary Blizzard Entertainment and its Chinese partner, NetEase.But the U.S. company said late last year it would suspend most of its game services in China after current licensing agreements ended, leading to a public spat between the two companies.Microsoft says its planned Activision acquisition — considered the priciest tech deal in history — now has been cleared in 37 countries, which includes the 27 in the EU as well as 10 others such as China, Japan and Brazil. But the blockbuster deal is still in jeopardy because British regulators have rejected it and U.S. authorities are trying to thwart it.","May 19, 2023 at 4:43 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-says-china-approves-plan-214333499.html,AP Finance,0.0,0.0,-0.025000000000000005,0.39666666666666667,2023-05-19 16:43:00,2023-05-19 16:43:00,78.25,78.58999633789062,-0.339996337890625

ATVI,Microsoft-Activision deal contends with conflicting rulings,"Yahoo Finance tech editor Dan Howley joins the Live Show to discuss the U.K.'s conflict with Microsoft's Activision Deal and Microsoft's future growth plans.Microsoft and Activision Blizzard can appeal those. They can fight the lawsuit that the FTC has brought, they can appeal the decision by the Competition and Markets Authority in the UK if they are able to show in the US that the EU is correct in its ruling and that, look, we have these guarantees. We're going to work with Sony. We're going to work with Nintendo, with Nvidia.We already have deals in place with Nintendo and Nvidia where we'll provide ""Call of Duty""-- that's the game that they're all talking about-- with 10 years of content. Then, perhaps, the FTC can say, OK-- or a judge can say, OK, you're satisfying the concerns that the FTC has there.If that happens, then what happens in the UK? Well, if Activision Blizzard and Microsoft can't appeal or lose the appeal there, some of the experts I spoke to say they might just carve out the UK on its own, set up a secondary business where they'll just operate as they do now, separate entities.And on the global scale, you would have Microsoft and Activision being able to offer their services as one. So you would have-- basically, what Microsoft wants to do is make its Cloud Gaming platform the best in the world. Frankly, it is right now, as far as offerings go and capabilities. And then they'll be able to grow in the mobile gaming space, another part that a lot of people aren't talking about, but an important piece of this discussion.Now, they would be able to do that everywhere else in the world. People would be able to play games on their smartphones that they otherwise wouldn't be able to do because of Cloud Gaming. And then the UK would just be left, kind of, in the dust. And perhaps, down the line, that would change.But it looks like, if they are able to go forward in the US, then the UK will just be left behind.","May 17, 2023 at 10:50 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/microsoft-activision-deal-contends-conflicting-155022760.html,Yahoo Finance Video,0.0,0.0,0.2717893217893218,0.5201770451770452,2023-05-17 10:50:00,2023-05-17 10:50:00,77.7699966430664,77.88999938964844,-0.12000274658203125

ATVI,Hunt urges competition chiefs to encourage growth after Microsoft deal blocked,"Jeremy Hunt has told competition chiefs that they must “understand their wider responsibilities” after the regulator was attacked by Microsoft for blocking a gaming mega-merger.The Chancellor insisted that he did not want to undermine the independence of the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), but said regulators also needed to focus on encouraging investment.Speaking at the British Chambers of Commerce annual conference on Wednesday, Mr Hunt said: “When it comes to Microsoft, there was a merger between two American companies that the US regulator is seeking to block, and the UK regulator took the same view.“I think one of the reasons that companies like Microsoft and Google want to invest in the UK is because we have independent regulators that are not controlled by politicians and therefore they can be confident there will be a level playing field.“I would not want to undermine that at all, but I do think it’s important all our regulators understand their wider responsibilities for economic growth.“But for our tech sector, it isn’t just about being able to get through big deals, competition really matters.”The comments are the first Mr Hunt has made on the blocked takeover bid.Last week the Government published a “strategic steer” document encouraging the CMA to take into account “the impact that [enforcement] has on economic growth”.When the deal was blocked, Activision said the decision meant the UK was “clearly closed for business” and said it would reconsider its investments in Britain.The CMA’s leaders defended their decision on Tuesday, telling MPs that they had not created a “hostile environment” for tech businesses.Sarah Cardell, the regulator’s chief executive, said that the decision to block Microsoft’s takeover of Activision was taken by an independent panel.Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

ATVI,PulteGroup and Vornado Realty have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,"Chicago, IL – May 17, 2023 – Zacks Equity Research shares PulteGroup PHM as the Bull of the Day and Vornado Realty Trust VNO as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Microsoft MSFT, Activision Blizzard ATVI and Sony's SONY.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:The reason that PHM is a Zacks #1 Rank now is that analysts launched their consensus estimates since that report from full-year EPS of $7.44 to $9.05.And next year's profit haul also moved higher from $7.24 to $9.00 per share.This rebound may mark the earnings trough not only for many homebuilders, but for real estate in general.This past weekend I published an article about the ""possible peak"" in my real estate-focused newsletter Multifamily Investing.You can read the full version at the link but here is a synopsis...The US economy is doing a pretty good job of absorbing the regional banking crisis.Despite the persistence of digital banks runs -- with short-sellers preying on blood in the water to drive out deposits by pummeling stock prices -- the stock market has held up well and the Federal Reserve signaled a pause in their efforts to battle inflation.Meanwhile, job creation, consumer spending, and housing markets remain strong according to a collection of robust data sets.This scenario sets up ""the pause"" for the Fed with interest rate hikes.That diverse body of economists, with tons of data and analysis at their disposal, has done a good amount to tamp down wildfire inflation.And while the yield curve will remain inverted for some time, the message is clear that they have taken a big bite out of the cost surges.So now we are seeing inflation stabilize across many sectors. Sure, 5-7% inflation in some sectors like Food & Energy are alarming.But what matters now to investors is the trend direction and speed.And that trend is showing a new downward trajectory in inflation and a slowing in the rate of acceleration in either direction.History shows that this pattern leads to the fire being put out.Especially in the age of exponential technologies that tend to foster hyper productivity and disinflation. Honestly, when was the last time you had to worry about sending a check, a document, a photo, or yourself for a signature when they can all be done now instantaneously?While I thought the regional banking crisis would have a bigger negative impact on mortgage lending than the positives of the Fed pause, I'm starting to reconsider that idea.In their article for Forbes Advisor, Mortgage Rate Forecast For 2023, Robin Rothstein and Chris Jennings (Editor) suggest that the inflation battle is being won and the market is recognizing this...Recent data indicates the Fed's tightening policy seems to be working, though some analysts say too well, given the ongoing turmoil in the banking sector. Nevertheless, headline inflation cooled to 5% in March for the first time in nearly two years and is well below its June 2022 peak of 9.1%. Even so, the current rate is still far above the Fed's 2% goal.The good thing about this article is that they quote a variety of real estate-focused economists and analysts sharing their views of the unfolding interest rate landscape.On the alarmed end of the spectrum comes this...""The latest interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve is unnecessary and harmful,"" said Lawrence Yun, chief economist at the National Association of Realtors, in an emailed statement. ""(Small regional banks) are becoming zombie-like banks, unable to lend even to good businesses as they are more concerned with balance sheet shuffling for survival. This situation will worsen with each additional rate hike by the Federal Reserve.""Among the optimists were these forecasts...National Association of Realtors (NAR). ""[F]orecasts that ... mortgage rates will drop—with the 30-year fixed mortgage rate progressively falling to 6.0% this year and to 5.6% in 2024.""Compass U.S. region president, Neda Navab. ""There have been signals that mortgage interest rates may be at or near their peak, given recent encouraging news around inflation and a corresponding drop in the U.S. Treasury yields that help set mortgage rates. A sustained drop could push mortgage rates into the 5% range late in the second quarter or in the second half of 2023, but that's definitely not guaranteed.""Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA). ""Long-term rates have already peaked. We expect that 30-year mortgage rates will end 2023 at 5.2%.""We've seen this movie before and it usually gets resolved after some customary political brinkmanship.But the Forbes Advisor piece does share some additional views, including the idea that the uncertainty and potential for default will keep rates elevated into the summer.This remains the wild card for the spring home-buying season.The good news is that digital-centric financial markets are extremely quick at absorbing new information (good or bad) and discounting new trends.This means that barring a tumultuous US default event, inflation and rates are trending down, the regional bank crisis volatility is being absorbed by much bigger banks, and national lenders, builders, and investors will be modeling for rates in the 5% handle.And if the economy avoids recession, then all the bargains I was expecting in the Multifamily space may not unfold either. To learn more, check out this on-demand educational webinar from Mike Morawski where he goes over the return dynamics, underwriting traps, and tax advantages of Multifamily Investing...Creating Generational WealthMike has some great slides in there that illustrate what I call the ""power laws"" of Cash Flow and Equity Build.Bottom line: We could still get more Regional Bank scares, but the intelligence of the market discounting machine has weighed and measured what these failures mean and found them lacking in systemic or economic impact. I am surprised by this, but then again, this is a feature and not a bug of US economic resilience as I talked about in my recent vlog...Dollar Destruction Hysteria: Why the Panic is Wrong, AgainVornado exited first-quarter 2023 with cash and cash equivalents of $890.9 million, slightly up from $889.7 million as of Dec 31, 2022.The EU's decision is seen as positive for competition and is expected to give a boost to the cloud streaming market, which currently makes up a small percentage of the overall gaming industry.The EU's viewpoint contrasts with that of the U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority and the US Federal Trade Commission, both of which had reservations about the deal. The main difference in opinions seems to revolve around how quickly the cloud gaming market will grow in the future.Overall, Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard has received EU approval but the deal's ultimate success depends on overcoming legal hurdles in the United States and the U.K. The decision by the EU shows confidence in the potential benefits of competition and growth of the cloud gaming market.The main problem with the acquisition is regarding the competition. Microsoft's gaming division would have too much of the industry, which could unfairly limit its competitors and ultimately harm consumers.In the United States, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) wants to stop Microsoft from buying Activision, as they believe it could have negative effects. The U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is also concerned that the deal could lead to higher prices and fewer options for gamers in the U.K.Although the deal is approved by the EU, it may not go through. The U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) had a dissenting opinion last month. CMA had cited cloud gaming market as a concern, which is now agreed by Microsoft. This could make the difference in CMA's decision.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is building an Xbox mobile store, which will offer games directly to mobile devices. Microsoft wants to add Activision Blizzard content to this store to build on its already existing communities of gamers.For fiscal fourth-quarter Microsoft expects Xbox content and services revenue growth in the low to mid-teens due to third-party and first-party content, as well as Xbox Game Pass.Microsoft's shares have gained 30.6% year to date, whereas the Zacks Computer and Technology sector have grown 22.7%.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

ATVI,"C3.ai, SoFi, Activision Blizzard: Monday's top trending tickers","Yahoo Finance's Allie Canal discusses movers and stocks to watch, including C3.ai, SoFi, and Activision Blizzard after EU regulators approve Microsoft's deal.[AUDIO LOGO]So this is one business that's clearly riding the AI wave, which we've seen across multiple industries. In fact, back in February, C3.AI saw shares surge 100% over the span of the month, which is when investors really started to hear more about OpenAI's ChatGPT.Now, today's stock boost does come after some turbulent times for the company. Earlier last month, we had a short seller letter alleging that C3.AI was involved in, quote, ""aggressive accounting to inflate its income statement."" The company did respond with a statement of its own, writing that the letter appears to be a highly creative and transparent attempt by a self-proclaimed short seller to short the stock, publish an inflammatory letter to move the stock price downward, then cover the short and pocket the profits.Year to date, C3.AI is up roughly 100%. But while that stock is up, SoFi Technologies is down. That's another stock I'm watching this afternoon, the stock off about 4 and 1/2 percent, a little less than that, on the heels of a Wall Street downgrade. Wedbush analyst downgrading the stock to underperform from neutral, also slashing their price target to $2.50 a share, down from the prior $5 a share.In a note released today, the analyst said the financial services company could be, quote, ""nearing a tipping point on the fee income it recognizes from loan applications and sales,"" warning the fee income could decline significantly. Wedbush added it thinks that SoFi's capital levels may be overstated using fair value accounting and that they don't believe SoFi will change their accounting methods in the near term.On top of those headwinds, the analyst said they think the company may look to raise capital this year to support growth. So Wall Street just continuing to remain a bit skeptical about this stock, with shares under pressure throughout the entire day. Although they have recovered from their lows earlier this morning.Now, of course, the story, it's far from over, considering the UK rejected the same plan last month. And then over here in the US, the Federal Trade Commission is continuing to evaluate the deal. Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley and Alexis Keenan have a full explainer up on the website right now. They really dive into the nuances surrounding this potential deal. And clearly a lot of interest, as we continue to wait and see whether or not this will get the full approval necessary.","May 15, 2023 at 2:37 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/c3-ai-sofi-activision-blizzard-193701774.html,Yahoo Finance Video,0.5,0.5,0.09987666237666237,0.4352745602745603,2023-05-15 14:37:00,2023-05-15 14:37:00,77.30999755859375,78.33000183105469,-1.0200042724609375

ATVI,Brussels locked in row with Britain over $69bn Microsoft deal,"Brussels is locked in a row with British regulators after waving through a $69bn (£55bn) video game takeover by Microsoft that had been blocked in the UK.The European Commission approved Microsoft's deal to buy Call of Duty maker Activision Blizzard on Monday after concluding that competition fears were not enough to justify halting the tie-up.In response, the CMA issued an unusual statement defending its decision and suggesting the Commission was wrong not to act.Sarah Cardell, chief executive, said: “The UK, US and European competition authorities are unanimous that this merger would harm competition in cloud gaming.“Microsoft’s proposals, accepted by the European Commission today, would allow Microsoft to set the terms and conditions for this market for the next ten years. They would replace a free, open and competitive market with one subject to ongoing regulation of the games Microsoft sells, the platforms to which it sells them, and the conditions of sale.“While we recognise and respect that the European Commission is entitled to take a different view, the CMA stands by its decision.”EU vice president Margrethe Vestager hailed her officials’ decision on Monday as “an important step” for the bloc, saying:“Video games attract billions of users all over the world. In such a fast-growing and dynamic industry, it is crucial to protect competition and innovation.“Our decision represents an important step in this direction, by bringing Activision’s popular games to many more devices and consumers than before thanks to cloud game streaming.”A Brussels spokesman added that the Commission had “based its decision on hard evidence and on extensive information and feedback”, while sources dismissed the UK's concerns about cloud gaming, saying that it accounted for just 1pc to 2pc of the overall market and any potential competition impact was therefore not significant.Brad Smith, Microsoft's president, said at the time that the intervention showed that the EU was a more attractive location than the UK.The takeover needed approval from both EU and UK regulators to go ahead, meaning that the CMA's decision has effectively killed it unless it is overturned on appeal. The US Federal Trade Commission is also suing Microsoft to block the deal.Bobby Kotick, chief executive of Activision, strongly hinted on Monday that his company would now expand into EU countries instead of Britain.Mr Kotick said: “We intend to meaningfully expand our investment and workforce throughout the EU, and we’re excited for the benefits our transaction brings to players in Europe and around the world.”Lulu Cheng Meservey, chief communications officer at Activision, praised the EU's “firm yet pragmatic, unbiased, and fact-driven approach to regulation”.British officials rallied to defend the CMA. A government spokesman said: “Every major competition authority – including in the EU and the US – agrees this merger would harm competition.”“The UK has the biggest tech sector in Europe and the third largest globally valued at $1tn, demonstrating the UK is open for business and an attractive place to invest.”UK competition officials said in April that Microsoft has a 60-70pc share of the cloud gaming market, adding that this number doubled over the past year.Activision’s share price crashed after the CMA decision was announced, while Monday’s decision saw little significant movement for either company. The Call of Duty publisher has said it is working “aggressively with Microsoft to reverse this on appeal”.A spokesman said at the time: “The report’s conclusions are a disservice to UK citizens, who face increasingly dire economic prospects.”Both companies are understood to be taking a legal case against the CMA to Britain’s Competition Appeal Tribunal.Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

ATVI,UPDATE 2-Microsoft wins EU antitrust approval for Activision deal vetoed by UK,"(Adds lawyer comment, shares, background)By Foo Yun CheeBRUSSELS, May 15 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp won EU antitrust approval for its $69 billion acquisition of Activision on Monday, in a significant boost that could prompt Chinese and South Korean regulators to follow suit despite a British veto of the deal.The U.S. software giant still faces a battle to clinch the world's biggest gaming industry takeover, however. It has until May 24 to appeal a decision by Britain's Competition & Markets Authority (CMA) to block it. A final decision may take months.The U.S. Federal Trade Commission's case against the deal is also pending at the agency, though Japan approved it in March.The European Commission said the transaction was pro-competitive due to Microsoft's agreement to licence popular Activision games such as ""Call of Duty"" to rival game streaming platforms, confirming a Reuters report in March.Such licences are ""practical and effective"", European Union antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager told reporters.""Actually they significantly improve the condition for cloud game streaming compared to the present situation, which is why we actually consider them pro-competitive,"" she added, contrasting with the UK position that the deal would hit competition in that part of the market.In rejecting the deal, the UK watchdog was seen as flexing its muscle on the global regulatory stage since Brexit.Microsoft has in recent months signed licensing deals with Nvidia, Nintendo, Ukraine's Boosteroid and Japan's Ubitus to bring Activision games to their platforms should the deal go through.""The European Commission has required Microsoft to license popular Activision Blizzard games automatically to competing cloud gaming services. This will apply globally and will empower millions of consumers worldwide to play these games on any device they choose,"" said Microsoft President Brad Smith.Activision's shares were up 1.3% at 1650 GMT, while Microsoft's were little changed.CLOUD GAMING MARKET GROWTHVestager said the Commission had a different view from UK regulators of how the game streaming market, which accounted for just 1% of the total market last year, would develop.""They see this market developing faster than we would think,"" she said. ""There is a bit of a paradox here, because we think that the remedies that we have taken ... will allow for licensing to many, many more in the cloud gaming markets.""Britain's CMA said streaming was the most rapidly growing sector in gaming, while consoles were a mature market. It said Microsoft already accounted for 60-70% of global cloud gaming services and had other trump cards: Xbox, the leading PC operating system Windows and cloud provider Azure.The CMA said on Monday it stood by its veto. Microsoft has said it will appeal that decision to the Competition Appeal Tribunal, with a ruling expected to take months.The EU move will give CMA critics ammunition against the agency, said Alex Haffner, a partner at London law firm Fladgate.""Critics of the CMA's stance, of which there have been many, will inevitably seize on today’s decision as proving the point made that the UK's regulatory regime is too rigid and stifles innovation,"" he said.""Microsoft and Activision’s lawyers will also use the decision to provide greater ballast to their appeal of the CMA's decision.""

ATVI,Roblox Wins Across Several Metrics But Profitability Is Not Around The Corner,"After UK regulators blocked its deal with Microsoft, Activision Blizzard reported massive profits from mobile games and Call of Duty. The latest reported revealed how lucrative the franchises under the Activision Blizzard umbrella are. If Microsoft succeeds to add Activision Blizzard to its Xbox brand, one can only imagine the possibilities one of the biggest deals in the history of gaming would bring. But despite the recent setback from regulators, Activision is also doing more than fine on its own, earning $2.38 billion in revenue and a profit of $740 million in its latest quarter.Both revenue and daily active users during the first quarter rose about 22% YoY. Revenue or bookings amounted to $774 million and topped the $766 million that Refinitiv expected a record all-time high number of 66 million users. Engagement also rose 23% measured as total hours spent in the game amounted to 14.5 billion. Founder and CEO David Baszucki attributed the bookings growth to eight quarters of exemplary innovation and engineering.But despite these expansions, losses were sharper than expected as net loss amounted to $268.3 million or 44 cents per share. According to Reuters, the losses are owed to developer exchange fees, personnel costs, and infrastructure expenses.Moreover, while Meta, Microsoft and others are conducting mass layoffs, Roblox continued to increase headcount on its growth path. Bookings growth is expected to exceed compensation growth in the beginning in the first fiscal quarter of 2024, moving forward on that trajectory.However, there’s also the fact that the metaverse is still far from reaching the mainstream, so the risk lies in whether this promise will be able to grow to its full potential. Additionally, with the competition intensifying and the tech sector being most prone to disruptors, one of its peers could potentially dethrone Roblox from its leading market position.With a solid cash position of $3 billion, Roblox has plenty of firepower to continue growing. To continue on its growth trajectory, Roblox needs to continue growing its users base and therefore, maintain its virtual cycle of ever-growing developers and continue producing high-quality content.But even after operating its platform for over a decade, the company remains unprofitable. In fact, its 2022 net loss came close to $924 million due to accelerated growth efforts so profitability is not around the corner. By showing a revenue growth of 292% from 2019’s fourth quarter ($147.6 million) to 2022’s fourth quarter ($579 million), it has a proven growth playbook to execute on. But the metaverse is still a risky bet for everyone playing the game, even Meta.DISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

ATVI,EU approves Microsoft's deal to buy 'Call of Duty' maker,"Activision stock was up 1% in morning trading following the decision, while Microsoft was roughly flat.An acquisition of Activision Blizzard would catapult Microsoft into the position of the third-largest gaming company in the world by revenue, after Tencent and Sony.The commission said although it concluded Microsoft's acquisition of the gaming giant would not threaten the market for gaming consoles and rival multi-game subscription services, it did find the deal could threaten competition in the market for distribution of games through cloud streaming services, and the market for PC operating systems.""Despite its potential, cloud game streaming is very limited today,"" the EC said in its press release. ""If Microsoft made Activision's games exclusive to its own cloud game streaming service, Microsoft could also strengthen the position of Windows in the market for PC operating systems.""Microsoft must also offer a corresponding free license to cloud game streaming service providers to provide Activision's PC and console games.Microsoft Vice Chair and President Brad Smith said ""the European Commission has required Microsoft to license popular Activision Blizzard games automatically to competing cloud gaming services. This will apply globally and will empower millions of consumers worldwide to play these games on any device they choose.""In a statement to Yahoo Finance, Activision Blizzard's spokesperson said, “The EC conducted an extremely thorough, deliberate process to gain a comprehensive understanding of gaming. As a result, they approved our merger with Microsoft, although they required stringent remedies to ensure robust competition in our rapidly growing industry.""Smith has said the company plans to appeal the CMA's decision.“We have already signed contracts to make Activision Blizzard’s popular games available on 150 million more devices, and we remain committed to reinforcing these agreements through regulatory remedies,” Smith said in an earlier statement sent to Yahoo Finance.“We’re especially disappointed that after lengthy deliberations, this decision appears to reflect a flawed understanding of this market and the way the relevant cloud technology actually works.”Activision, for its part, said it, too, would appeal the decision and threatened to pull back on its investment in the UK. A spokesperson for the company also accused the CMA of contradicting the UK’s ambitions to become an attractive country for technology-building businesses.“The report’s conclusions are a disservice to UK citizens, who face increasingly dire economic prospects. We will reassess our growth plans for the UK. Global innovators large and small will take note that — despite all its rhetoric — the UK is clearly closed for business,” the company said in an earlier statement.Cloud gaming allows gamers to play titles that would normally require high-powered consoles and PCs on low-powered devices including smart TVs, smartphones, tablets, laptops, and Chromebooks.The latest title in the franchise, “Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,” topped $1 billion in sales over its first 10 days on the market. Cutting out Sony would mean eating into “Call of Duty’s” sales.A central concern for US regulators is that Microsoft's ownership of Activision’s “Call of Duty” franchise ""would enable Microsoft to suppress competitors to its Xbox gaming consoles and its rapidly growing subscription content and cloud-gaming business.”Microsoft has countered those concerns through an offer to keep the popular game available to Sony's PlayStation for 10 years. It reached similar agreements with Nintendo and Nvidia.However, the FTC has accused Microsoft of backtracking on a similar, prior assurance in another tie-up with content developer Zenimax. Microsoft promised but failed to keep Zenimax products available on third-party platforms after it acquired the developer for $7.5 billion in 2021.The FTC has also expressed concerns that Microsoft is one of only two high-performance console makers.It's not just cloud gaming and ""Call of Duty,"" though.Microsoft would also stand to benefit from Activision Blizzard's mobile-focused King business. Mobile is the fastest-growing gaming segment thanks to the ubiquity of smartphones.And that's important when trying to reach consumers in developing countries. After all, while consumers in those regions might not be able to afford pricy PCs and consoles, they can get their hands on low-cost smartphones.Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance","May 15, 2023 at 10:02 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/eu-approves-microsofts-deal-to-buy-call-of-duty-maker-150234770.html,Yahoo Finance,0.0,0.0,0.08204177897574123,0.5189240790655882,2023-05-15 10:02:00,2023-05-15 10:02:00,77.30999755859375,78.33000183105469,-1.0200042724609375

ATVI,EU backs Microsoft buying Call of Duty maker Activision Blizzard. But the $69B deal is still at risk,"The acquisition, sweetened by Microsoft's promises to automatically license Activision games to cloud gaming platforms, “would no longer raise competition concerns and would ultimately unlock significant benefits for competition and consumers,” said the European Commission, the 27-nation bloc’s executive arm and top antitrust watchdog.The commission's approval “has removed one potential major roadblock for this deal” but “it doesn’t necessarily mean they’re in a stronger position” to overturn the U.K.'s rejection, said Liam Deane, a game industry analyst for tech research and advisory firm Omdia.Following its review, the European Commission dismissed the possibility that Microsoft would cut off its games from PlayStation, saying that excluding the most popular gaming console would put a big dent in its profits.The commission approved the deal after accepting Microsoft’s offer to modify its licensing agreements to allow users and cloud gaming platforms to stream its titles without paying royalties for 10 years.The licenses “will apply globally and will empower millions of consumers worldwide to play these games on any device they choose,” Microsoft President Brad Smith said in a statement.Activision games aren't available on cloud services, but the commission noted that the licensing commitments could expand the cloud gaming market “by bringing Activision’s games to new platforms, including smaller EU players, and to more devices than before.”Britain’s Competition and Markets Authority said in a statement Monday that it “stands by its decision,” an unusual move that highlights the more muscular approach London has taken.“Microsoft’s proposals, accepted by the European Commission today, would allow Microsoft to set the terms and conditions for this market for the next ten years,” authority chief executive Sarah Cardell said. “They would replace a free, open and competitive market with one subject to ongoing regulation of the games Microsoft sells, the platforms to which it sells them, and the conditions of sale.”The companies are appealing the U.K. decision to a tribunal, but history doesn’t bode well.If Microsoft's appeal fails, the company would be forced to either scrap the deal or carve out the U.K. as a separate market, which appeared to be an unfeasible option, said Deane, the game analyst.","May 15, 2023 at 9:34 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/eu-backs-microsoft-buying-call-143442246.html,AP Finance,0.0,0.0,0.07982323232323234,0.44167929292929303,2023-05-15 09:34:00,2023-05-15 09:34:00,77.30999755859375,78.33000183105469,-1.0200042724609375
ATVI,Microsoft wins EU antitrust approval for Activision deal vetoed by UK,"By Foo Yun CheeBRUSSELS (Reuters) -Microsoft Corp won EU antitrust approval for its $69 billion acquisition of Activision on Monday, in a significant boost that could prompt Chinese and South Korean regulators to follow suit despite a British veto of the deal.The U.S. software giant still faces a battle to clinch the world's biggest gaming industry takeover, however. It has until May 24 to appeal a decision by Britain's Competition & Markets Authority (CMA) to block it. A final decision may take months.The U.S. Federal Trade Commission's case against the deal is also pending at the agency, though Japan approved it in March.The European Commission said the transaction was pro-competitive due to Microsoft's agreement to licence popular Activision games such as ""Call of Duty"" to rival game streaming platforms, confirming a Reuters report in March.Such licences are ""practical and effective"", European Union antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager told reporters.""Actually they significantly improve the condition for cloud game streaming compared to the present situation, which is why we actually consider them pro-competitive,"" she added, contrasting with the UK position that the deal would hit competition in that part of the market.In rejecting the deal, the UK watchdog was seen as flexing its muscle on the global regulatory stage since Brexit.Microsoft has in recent months signed licensing deals with Nvidia, Nintendo, Ukraine's Boosteroid and Japan's Ubitus to bring Activision games to their platforms should the deal go through.""The European Commission has required Microsoft to license popular Activision Blizzard games automatically to competing cloud gaming services. This will apply globally and will empower millions of consumers worldwide to play these games on any device they choose,"" said Microsoft President Brad Smith.Activision's shares were up 1.3% at 1650 GMT, while Microsoft's were little changed.CLOUD GAMING MARKET GROWTHVestager said the Commission had a different view from UK regulators of how the game streaming market, which accounted for just 1% of the total market last year, would develop.""They see this market developing faster than we would think,"" she said. ""There is a bit of a paradox here, because we think that the remedies that we have taken ... will allow for licensing to many, many more in the cloud gaming markets.""Britain's CMA said streaming was the most rapidly growing sector in gaming, while consoles were a mature market. It said Microsoft already accounted for 60-70% of global cloud gaming services and had other trump cards: Xbox, the leading PC operating system Windows and cloud provider Azure.The CMA said on Monday it stood by its veto. Microsoft has said it will appeal that decision to the Competition Appeal Tribunal, with a ruling expected to take months.The EU move will give CMA critics ammunition against the agency, said Alex Haffner, a partner at London law firm Fladgate.""Critics of the CMA's stance, of which there have been many, will inevitably seize on today’s decision as proving the point made that the UK's regulatory regime is too rigid and stifles innovation,"" he said.""Microsoft and Activision’s lawyers will also use the decision to provide greater ballast to their appeal of the CMA's decision.""(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee, additional reporting by Paul Sandle in London; Editing by Alexander Smith and Mark Potter)","May 15, 2023 at 9:32 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/eu-antitrust-regulators-clear-69-143207240.html,Reuters,0.3,0.2,0.09519230769230769,0.41196581196581195,2023-05-15 09:32:00,2023-05-15 09:32:00,77.30999755859375,78.33000183105469,-1.0200042724609375

ATVI,Microsoft to defend Activision deal in gamers' lawsuit in US court,"By Mike Scarcella(Reuters) - Microsoft Corp on Friday will defend its $69 billion planned acquisition of ""Call of Duty"" maker Activision Blizzard Inc, in a private antitrust lawsuit in San Francisco federal court brought by video gamers who claim the deal will harm industry competition and should be stopped.At the hearing, U.S. District Judge Jacqueline Corley will weigh a request that she issue a preliminary injunction barring the proposed acquisition.The deal would mark the largest-ever in gaming if it is completed. Microsoft has defended the tie-up as benefiting gamers, and its lawyers have asked Corley to deny blocking the acquisition.""What plaintiffs ask this court to do is unprecedented. They have not cited a single case where a court has enjoined a merger based on alleged harms claimed by a few individual consumers,"" Microsoft's lawyers told Corley in a May 5 court filing.The deal, first announced in January 2022, separately faces intense regulatory scrutiny by U.S., European Union, UK and other competition law enforcers.Britain's antitrust regulator said in April it would block Microsoft's acquisition, after the company failed to assuage competition concerns.The U.S. Federal Trade Commission's case against the deal is pending at the agency.Joseph Alioto, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said the gamers have a ""very strong complaint"" challenging the acquisition.A Microsoft spokesperson said the plaintiffs' complaint contained ""unsupported and implausible claims about the deal's effect on competition.""U.S. antitrust laws allow private consumers to sue over proposed acquisitions in lawsuits that are distinct from any federal regulatory actions.Corley in March dismissed an earlier version of the plaintiffs' complaint, which she called ""insufficient."" She allowed the plaintiffs to refile a more robust complaint.The plaintiffs' lawyers on Monday urged Corley to block the deal to allow a trial on the merits of the acquisition to take place.""The loss of competition cannot be reclaimed,"" the plaintiffs' attorneys said in a court filing. ""Unwinding the merger after consummation is highly problematic and disfavored, making divestiture post-consummation significantly more difficult.""The case is Demartini v.

""We are deeply proud of the progress we’ve made on our 2022 ESG initiatives, and we are committed to continuous improvement in each of our key pillars.""2022 Results:Championing Our PeopleAll business units saw an increase in the combined representation of women and non-binary employees. As of November 30, 2022, approximately 26% of our global employee population self-reported as women or non-binary people, up from approximately 24% as of November 30, 2021.Women in game development leadership roles more than quadrupled since 2016. The company grew game development teams by 25% in 2022.Globally, employees who self-reported as women or non-binary people, or who self-reported as something else earned on average $1.00 for every $1.00 earned by men for comparable work.The company expanded benefits to include unlimited virtual counseling sessions through BetterHelp, increased adoption benefit to $20,000 from $5,000, and more.Advancing Diverse and Inclusive CommunitiesDiversity and inclusion are foundational to the company’s games, policies, and workforce commitments. In 2022 the company made strong progress as it:Hired its first Chief Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Officer, Kristen Hines.Appointed its first Head of Inclusive Game Design, Adrian Ledda, who helped develop a consistent approach to embedding inclusive game design into content pipeline reviews.Initiated a partnership with Reboot Representation to help increase the number of Black, Latina, and Native American women in technology through a $2 million grant funded by the company.Protecting the PlanetActivision Blizzard is committed to reaching net zero carbon emissions by 2050. To achieve this goal, the company has developed a decarbonization roadmap and has created a detailed operating plan to reduce carbon intensity, water usage, and waste.

Rival Riot Games Inc. has also reported gains.Most Read from BloombergA 32-Year-Old Nears Billionaire Status by Using AI to Broker Japan MergersDebt Deadlock Spurs Late-Day Slide in US Stocks: Markets WrapGoogle Billionaire Sergey Brin Gifts $600 Million in Surging SharesBiden, McCarthy Voice Cautious Optimism on Debt Deal After TalksGoldman Banker Wins Promotion, Then Leaves for Rival Two Weeks LaterSanta Monica, California-based Activision said employees who self report as women or nonbinary increased to about 26% of the company’s total workforce in 2022, up from 24% the prior year.Activision, which employs about 13,000 people, has appointed an officer to oversee diversity, equity and inclusion, and named a head of inclusive game design. The maker of Call of Duty and other titles has agreed to be acquired by Microsoft Corp. although the deal has faced opposition by regulators in the US and the UK.Game makers are slowly increasing their diversity after facing lawsuits alleging widespread sexism. Riot Games, the maker of League of Legends, issued a report last month citing progress expanding its ranks of female employees. The share of women staffers there rose to 27.5% in 2022, from 22% in 2019However, the industry remains less diverse than the tech industry overall despite pressure from regulators, media and employees. By comparison, women made up about one-third of employees at Google and Microsoft last year. Although about half of gamers are women, according to the Entertainment Software Association, they make up less than a quarter of game developers, according to some estimates.In 2021, California’s Civil Rights Department sued Activision for fostering a “frat boy” culture. The 2021 complaint alleged that 80% of employees were male and that “very few women ever reach top roles at the company.” The prior year, Ubisoft Entertainment SA faced allegations of sexual misconduct.In 2018, a Kotaku investigation revealed rampant sexism at Riot, which is owned by Tencent Holdings Ltd. The Civil Rights Department filed a complaint against Los Angeles-based company the next year.In its latest report, Activision said the share of women in game development leadership roles jumped 58% last year.Activision’s new chief diversity officer, Kristen Hines, in her first interview since taking the job, said her early goal was to help reframe the company’s thinking about diversity, equity and inclusion. “How do we embed across all of our business so it evolves from a ‘Did we check the box’ mindset,” she said.Activision’s goals for the year ahead include publishing promotion rates by gender globally and by race in the US.The industry’s past behavior toward women was “irrefutable and unacceptable,” Hines said.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekEric Adams Is Starving New York City’s Universal Pre-K ProgramThe Green Energy Transition Has a Chilean Copper ProblemAI Lets Microsoft Target Google and Google Target AmazonChina’s $220 Billion Biotech Initiative Is Struggling to Take OffThe Plot to Steal the Other Secret Inside a Can of Coca-Cola©2023 Bloomberg L.P.","May 11, 2023 at 11:31 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/activision-once-dinged-frat-boy-163108136.html,Bloomberg,0.5,0.5,-0.013104212860310422,0.28266075388026607,2023-05-11 11:31:00,2023-05-11 11:31:00,76.2699966430664,77.04000091552734,-0.7700042724609375
ATVI,EU regulators set to rule on Microsoft-Activision deal,"Yahoo Finance tech editor Dan Howley reports from the Google I/O 2023 Conference to discuss EU regulators ruling on the Microsoft-Activision deal next week.Don't forget though, the FTC is also suing to stop this here in the US. So Microsoft and Activision still have a number of hurdles to get over before they can complete this $70 billion deal. If it goes through, it would be Microsoft's largest. And it would be absolutely huge for the company as far as its gaming enterprise because it would be able to then build out both its mobile and cloud gaming.And the reason why the UK said they blocked it was because of a potential threat to the cloud gaming space. Microsoft is the leader in it. It's still very, very early. Google tried to get in and already bounced. Amazon is in there still. Nvidia's in there as well. And Sony's still trying to catch up.But if Microsoft can somehow manage to turn around the UK and FTC, it could be a major win for them.","May 10, 2023 at 3:09 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/eu-regulators-set-rule-microsoft-200907208.html,Yahoo Finance Video,0.0,0.0,0.23250000000000004,0.5794444444444444,2023-05-10 15:09:00,2023-05-10 15:09:00,76.5999984741211,76.0,0.5999984741210938

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Exxon Mobil Corp, Costco Wholesale Corp., and Activision Blizzard, Inc. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.The firm has made more than 30 discoveries in offshore Guyana since 2015. ExxonMobil also has a strong presence in the prolific Permian Basin, where it delivered record production in 2022. Also, a strong presence in chemicals and refining operations is noteworthy.However, ExxonMobil has constantly been bearing the brunt of increasing costs, adversely affecting its income. Also, the company's financials were weakened by years-long significant spending on low-return developments and the pandemic.Its business can navigate the ongoing inflationary environment and supply chain bottlenecks on several fronts. A favorable product mix, steady store traffic, pricing power, and strong liquidity position should help Costco.Activision's first-quarter 2023 earnings and revenues increased year-over-year. First-quarter growth was broad-based, with net bookings increasing year-over-year in Call of Duty, Candy Crush, Warcraft, Overwatch, and Diablo. Call of Duty in-game net bookings on console and PC grew strongly year-over-year in the first quarter.The Zacks analyst believes that Diablo Immortal on mobile and PC also contributed to Blizzard's first-quarter net bookings growth. Candy Crush payer numbers again grew year-over-year, and Candy Crush was the top-grossing game franchise in the U.S. app stores for the 23rd quarter in a row.Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Biogen Inc. and Arista Networks, Inc.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

ATVI,Microsoft hires Brussels-beating lawyer to take on Britains competition watchdog,"Microsoft has hired a lawyer who has repeatedly defeated the EU as it seeks to overturn a decision by Britain’s competition regulator to block its £55bn gaming takeover.The US tech giant has enlisted Daniel Beard KC as it prepares to lodge an appeal at the Competition Appeal Tribunal in the coming days.Mr Beard of Monckton Chambers is seen as a leading competition barrister and has overturned multi-billion dollar penalties levied on Apple and Intel by the EU in recent years.Last year, Mr Beard overturned a €1.1bn fine handed to Intel more than a decade ago after the European Commission had claimed the company had abused its dominance of the microchip market. The case was seen as a landmark blow for Brussels’ attempts to rein in Big Tech.Mr Beard had represented Microsoft in the late stages of hearings with the CMA, before the regulator blocked the takeover in April.An appeal at the Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT) is likely to take several months, beyond the July 18 deadline for the two companies to complete the deal. The timeline is already likely to be extended because US regulators have launched a legal challenge to the deal.If Microsoft successfully appeals the CMA’s ruling, the case can be sent back to the regulator to reconsider its decision. If the CAT refuses the case, the company can then take the case to the Court of Appeal.In addition to representing Apple and Intel, Mr Beard represented Sky in seeking to overturn a 2007 Government decision that the broadcaster must sell down its stake in ITV, which it eventually lost. He also argued for Tesco in 2009 as the supermarket overturned a Competition Commission ruling that planning permission for new stores should require a competition test.Microsoft has said it remains “fully committed” to the deal despite the CMA block. Activision’s chief executive Bobby Kotick has said the company will support Microsoft’s appeal.He said when the deal was blocked: “We’re confident in our case because the facts are on our side: this deal is good for competition.”Mr Kotick has said that over regulation will mean the company reassessing its growth plans in the UK.The Government plans to grant the CMA new powers to issue hefty fines to tech companies that are seen as abusing their position.Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

ATVI,"Activision Blizzard, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:ATVI) latest 12% decline adds to one-year losses, institutional investors may consider drastic measures","Significantly high institutional ownership implies Activision Blizzard's stock price is sensitive to their trading actionsThe top 25 shareholders own 50% of the company Insiders have sold recently As a result, institutional investors endured the highest losses last week after market cap fell by US$8.3b. Needless to say, the recent loss which further adds to the one-year loss to shareholders of 3.5% might not go down well especially with this category of shareholders. Also referred to as ""smart money"", institutions have a lot of sway over how a stock's price moves. As a result, if the decline continues, institutional investors may be pressured to sell Activision Blizzard which might hurt individual investors.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Activision Blizzard, beginning with the chart below. See our latest analysis for Activision Blizzard Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Activision Blizzard. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Activision Blizzard's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.Since institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Activision Blizzard. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 7.9% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 7.2% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 6.7% by the third-largest shareholder. In addition, we found that Robert Kotick, the CEO has 0.5% of the shares allocated to their name.After doing some more digging, we found that the top 25 have the combined ownership of 50% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.The general public-- including retail investors -- own 16% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.We can see that public companies hold 6.7% of the Activision Blizzard shares on issue. We can't be certain but it is quite possible this is a strategic stake. The businesses may be similar, or work together.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

ATVI,RPT-EXPLAINER-What next for Microsoft's $69 bln Activision deal after UK ban?,"(Repeats April 28 item with no changes to text)By Paul SandleLONDON, April 28 (Reuters) - Britain's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) on Wednesday blocked Microsoft's $69 billion acquisition of 'Call of Duty' maker Activision Blizzard over concerns it would hinder cloud gaming.The ruling was a shock after the regulator had already resolved its concerns about the consoles market, a sector dominated by Sony's PlayStation and Microsoft's Xbox, which dwarfs cloud gaming.IS THE DEAL DEAD?Not necessarily. Microsoft said it remained fully committed and would appeal.The regulator's decision reflected a flawed understanding of the market, it said.HOW DOES THE APPEAL PROCESS WORK?Microsoft can appeal to Britain's Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT), an independent judicial body, which will only examine the CMA's decision-making process, not the merits of the merger.Microsoft will not be able to offer new remedies at this stage, such as offering to keep Activision content off its Xbox Game Pass, a subscription service for Xbox users, in Britain, as some analysts suggest.""The CAT will not engage with the merits of the CMA's decision or conduct a wholesale review of the parties' evidence,"" said Edward Lane, senior associate at law firm Harbottle & Lewis, where his particular focus is on creative industries, including film, TV, video games and music.WHAT'S NEXT?Microsoft must appeal by May 24 and a decision may take many months.""The CAT aims to deal with 'straightforward' cases in under nine months – and Microsoft/Activision is anything but straightforward,"" Lane, said.WHAT HAPPENS IF MICROSOFT WINS?The Tribunal will return the case to the regulator for further review. Microsoft can then offer new concessions.""The likelihood is that without a material change in circumstances or new evidence, the CMA is most likely to reach the same conclusion as it did first time around,"" said James Groves, a competition associate at European law firm Fieldfisher.WHAT ABOUT OTHER REGULATORS?European regulators will rule on the world's biggest gaming deal by May 22. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission filed a complaint to block the deal, which Microsoft has indicated it will fight.If either of those blocks the deal, it could be game over, Lane said.If the EU goes against it, Microsoft would be fighting an increasingly uphill battle and could decide to cut its losses, even if that would mean paying Activision a hefty $3 billion break fee.WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO OTHER CMA APPEALS?Facebook-owner Meta appealed a 2021 decision by the CMA to block its acquisition of Giphy, seen as a test case for the British regulator's resolve to take on ""Big Tech"".Meta succeeded on a single procedural ground, with the decision otherwise upheld. The CMA considered new submissions, but it came to the same view and Meta had to sell animated images platform Giphy.Global financial services company FNZ appealed a block on its 2019 merger with rival GBST. The regulator then ""identified certain potential errors"" in its investigation chaired by Martin Coleman, who also oversaw the Microsoft-Activision case.The CAT sent the case back to be reconsidered, and the CMA agreed to accept a new remedy whereby FNZ could sell GBST and then buy parts of it back.(Reporting by Paul Sandle; Editing by Josephine Mason and Tomasz Janowski)","May 2, 2023 at 12:00 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rpt-explainer-next-microsofts-69-050000670.html,Reuters,0.0,0.0,0.03760110503531555,0.42927916381863757,2023-05-02 00:00:00,2023-05-02 00:00:00,77.04000091552734,76.0,1.0400009155273438

ATVI,Activisions UK division faces HMRC investigation over diverted profits,"A UK subsidiary of the Call of Duty developer disclosed in its most recent accounts that it had “settled tax liabilities” worth $31m (£25m) with HMRC and was facing further questions over diverted profits and “transfer pricing” arrangements.The dispute has rumbled on as Activision attempted to secure a merger with US tech giant Microsoft, a $69bn deal and the largest takeover ever in the video games sector.The decision prompted a furious reaction from Activision, which threatened to “reassess our growth plans” for Britain and warned the UK was “clearly closed for business”. Activision and Microsoft pledged to appeal the decision.While Activision has sparred with the UK’s competition watchdog, it has also been locked in talks with HMRC over its tax affairs.Accounts for its UK subsidiary, Midasplayer.com Ltd, show it agreed to pay millions of pounds to the taxman over a “TP [transfer pricing] and DPT [diverted profit tax] enquiry”.Midasplayer is owned by King.com Limited, which is registered in Malta and owned by Activision.King is the developer of hit mobile apps such as Candy Crush, the colourful smartphone puzzle game, which Activision acquired for $6bn in 2015.The island nation has faced accusations of operating as a tax haven.Activision’s UK mobile gaming company paid £25m in settlements in 2020, while discussions over further tax matters dating from 2016 to 2020 were ongoing as of the signing of its accounts in September last year.The business reported profits of $469m in the year ending December 2021, paying $11.7m in total taxes.According to Blizzard’s US filings, the company is engaged in a “collaborative multilateral process with tax authorities” in the UK and Sweden over its King division.In February this year, HMRC disclosed it was “currently carrying out around 100 reviews into multinationals with arrangements to divert profits… the total amount of tax under consideration in these cases was £2.4bn at the end of March 2022”.The diverted profit tax, known as the “Google tax”, was introduced by George Osborne in 2015, allowing HMRC to chase down multinationals that had tried to avoid paying enough tax on UK profits by routing it overseas.The levy could be charged on diverted profits at a rate 5pc higher than normal corporation tax.","May 1, 2023 at 7:07 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/activision-uk-division-faces-hmrc-120731687.html,The Telegraph,0.0,0.0,0.04865079365079365,0.434920634920635,2023-05-01 07:07:00,2023-05-01 07:07:00,77.5999984741211,77.43000030517578,0.1699981689453125
ATVI,Microsofts threats against the UK could backfire,"“It should be as much the aim of those who seek for social betterment to rid the business world of crimes of cunning, as to rid the entire body politic of crimes of violence,” President Roosevelt told Congress in his State of the Union Address in 1901.Today, the Roosevelts – Theodore and Franklin Delano – are credited with saving capitalism from the populists and socialists who wanted to burn the house down.Both challenged the idea that business should do exactly as it pleased.Yet today “Big Tech” platforms have replaced a functioning marketplace with systems they control, carefully rationing the information that both producers and consumers need. That’s a “crime of cunning” few can comprehend. So the world has changed, but competition policy hasn’t. Last week, the UK made its move.After Brexit, Smith said the European Union was now a “more attractive place” than the UK. And darkly, he also mentioned national security, when he said “we play a vital role not just supporting businesses and nonprofits but even defending the nation from cybersecurity threats”.Would Microsoft really leave us vulnerable because it couldn’t get the rights to Call of Duty? Such threats may backfire, and it all rather smacks of entitlement.They fear the CMA’s new doctrine may one day deny them a well-deserved cash out. But others whisper that high quality content creators must be able to set the price for their goods in a fair negotiation, and they see what can happen in the platform world, where a dominant distributor sets the terms of trade. Entrepreneurs still quite like the idea of growing the company that they founded independently.There is a growing conservative support in the US for taming a censorious Big Tech. Many were wary of handing even more market power to Microsoft, which is already a giant games publisher.Some will doubtless recall how key Microsoft products, such as its Internet Explorer web browser, languished and became dilapidated over the years from neglect, once the threat of competition diminished. However to be fair, Microsoft’s games story is a little different.The games division somehow evaded the savage corporate infighting and entropy at Microsoft under its previous CEO, Steve Ballmer, that had made other arms such dysfunctional operations. It deserves the success it enjoys today.As the CMA explained: “the cloud allows UK gamers to avoid buying expensive gaming consoles and PCs and gives them much more flexibility and choice as to how they play.”Blocking such acquisitions entails a major philosophical break with the principle that has guided competition regulators for 40 years. This is the idea that lower prices trump all other considerations. In US law this is enshrined as “the consumer welfare standard”.“In the US now it’s broadly accepted now that the consumer welfare standard is dead – but we need new ideas,” says Caffara, now a managing partner at Keystone.The problem is that as Big Tech has grown more dominant, the very idea of markets has fallen out of fashion. Those who once defended them have become mindless cheerleaders for monopolies. And one senses that if it was all left to Labour, they’d be quite happy with monopolies, so long as they can tax them every now and again.So regulators are stumbling towards new thinking on competition that’s more reflective of the dominance of Big Tech, largely alone. They have a sympathetic public to call on, but few friends. We can hardly blame the CMA for trying, no matter how clumsily, to address a very real problem.Andrew Orlowski is on Twitter @andreworlowski","May 1, 2023 at 4:00 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-threats-against-uk-could-090000712.html,The Telegraph,0.0,0.0,0.09085964035964036,0.42681601731601726,2023-05-01 04:00:00,2023-05-01 04:00:00,77.5999984741211,77.43000030517578,0.1699981689453125

ATVI,4 big deal reports: Activision plunges on blocked Microsoft buyout | Pro Recap,"Investing.com -- Here is your Pro Recap of the biggest head-turning deal dispatches you may have missed this week: a shocking block for the Microsoft-Activision buyout in the U.K.; a scramble to save the failing First Republic Bank; a multibillion-dollar deal for Carrier Global; and Getty Images' response to an unsolicited bid from an activist investor.Shares of Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) plummeted more than 11% on Wednesday after the United Kingdom's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) issued an order blocking Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) $68.7 billion pending acquisition of the company.The CMA's final ruling cited concerns that the deal would harm competition in the fast-growing cloud gaming market, potentially leading to reduced innovation and choice for U.K. gamers in the years to come.The agency also noted that Microsoft's prior proposed solutions failed to address these concerns, with significant shortcomings requiring regulatory oversight. Panel Chair Martin Coleman emphasized that cloud gaming requires a free, competitive market to drive innovation and choice.The proposed merger has faced roadblocks in the U.K. since its announcement in January 2022, with an in-depth review launched in September of the same year.According to BMO Capital, this is a shocking development as the CMA had previously concluded that the deal would not hurt competition in the console market, which seemed the more significant concern. The CMA was always clear that it was skeptical about the cloud gaming market. Activision Blizzard has announced that it intends to collaborate with Microsoft to appeal the decision.After a shattering week for First Republic Bank (NYSE:FRC) investors, U.S. regulators were attempting over the weekend to secure a sale of the failing bank.According to Reuters, sources say about a half-dozen banks are bidding for First Republic, among them Citizens Financial (NYSE:CFG), PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC), and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM). The bidding process is being run by the Federal Deposit Insurance Company, sources told Reuters, and a deal should be announced by Sunday night.This week saw steep declines in the shares that began when the bank disclosed $100B in customer withdrawals the previous month.In an effort to stabilize the bank's finances, First Republic's advisors had attempted to persuade larger U.S. banks to acquire bonds from them at above-market prices, as reported by CNBC.Shares closed the week with a massive 75% loss.Carrier Global (NYSE:CARR) has confirmed its acquisition of Viessmann Climate Solutions for €12B in cash (80%) and stock (20%), with the stock issued directly to Viessmann Group under a long-term ownership commitment.The acquisition reinforces Carrier's position as a leading player in the European climate and energy transition market, positioning the company for sustainable growth.Following the announcement, several Wall Street firms lowered their price targets on the stock, including Barclays with a new target of $48.00 (from $50.00), Citi with a new target of $45.00 (from $48.00), RBC Capital with a new target of $48.00 (from $54.00), and Morgan Stanley with a new target of $49.00 (from $50.00).Shares fell more than 7% this week.Getty Images (NYSE:GETY) shares jumped 31% on Monday after activist investor Trillium Capital announced that it has made a bid to acquire the company for $10 per share in cash.However, the next day shares fell more than 4% as Getty Images said the offer is not sufficiently credible to warrant engagement by its Board.Shares closed the week with a 27% gain.Related Articles4 big deal reports: Activision plunges on blocked Microsoft buyout | Pro RecapUBS looks to bring Naratil back and mulls Swiss bank spin-off - NZZ4 hot insider trades: Enphase director buys $4.6M in stock | Pro Recap","April 30, 2023 at 12:56 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-big-deal-reports-activision-055613132.html,Investing.com,0.0,0.1,0.06391184573002755,0.42484504132231415,2023-04-30 00:56:00,2023-04-30 00:56:00,,,
ATVI,Brexit has ushered in a new nanny state,"But what's this?It is as though Britain is in competition with the EU over quite how punitively politically suspect – though entirely legitimate – business activity might be treated.In both cases, this seems to be more a case of taking back control so as to exercise more of it than freeing business from the well-intentioned but enterprise-crushing burden of EU constraint.To have left the European Union only to become more like it seems an odd path to tread.It says a lot about the deficiencies at the heart of the UK economy that gaming and online gambling are in fact two of Britain's most successful industries.According to the Competition and Markets Authority, the gaming industry alone is the UK's largest revenue-generating form of entertainment, with around £5bn in annual revenue, or more than pay TV, video streaming, cinema, music and books.Some of these strictures, which come overwhelmingly from the two parties with the most to lose, should no doubt be treated sceptically.The CMA's decision has effectively scuppered the entire deal, with limited chances of reversal on appeal. It is understandable that Microsoft, which has been working on the transaction for the best part of two years and sees it as key to the company's future, should be angry.But has confidence in the UK really been as “severely shaken” as Mr Smith claims?This seems a little far fetched. There are surely much bigger threats to Britain's “world beating” position in gaming content – tax and the wider regulatory framework for business prime among them – than this.Microsoft is substantially invested in the UK, and has spent decades building its presence here. It is not about to write this off in a petulant fit of pique, and nor is Activision, which is similarly a big employer in the UK.In order to get the deal through, they could conceivably quit the UK market for cloud gaming, but this would be difficult, if not impossible.The threat of such action none the less raises a serious point.The European authorities have, perhaps surprisingly, taken a much more relaxed view of the Activision takeover than the CMA, and indeed seemed minded to accept the very same behavioural remedies proposed by Microsoft that the CMA has rejected.Indeed, were it not for Brexit, the CMA would have had little or no traction on the merger in the first place, even if admittedly it could have fed into the European judgment.As it is, the CMA is fast establishing itself as the world's most hawkish global enforcer, and what is more, one with the powers to ensure that its actions actually have some effect.Think of it like this: if Norway was to put its foot down and banned Microsoft from acquiring Activision, nobody would bat an eyelid.Microsoft and Activision would simply close their businesses in Norway and move on, little or no harm done to their merger or ongoing business activity. Norway is too small to matter.Yet if the EU were to do the same, the two companies would have no option but to abandon the merger. The EU is the biggest consumer market in the world, and even the mighty Microsoft cannot afford to be out of it.The UK sits somewhere in between. It is too large a market for Microsoft to easily bypass, but not so large that it would be unthinkable.If you believe your plans are going to be constantly scuppered by UK enforcers, you will in time take steps to disengage from the jurisdiction.Nor is it just big multinational corporations where this way of thinking might apply.Smaller, entrepreneurial ventures, like, say, the very same gaming content providers the UK is so good at spawning, might think twice about investing here if they thought attempts to sell the business might be blocked.The CMA's actions also look disproportionate on the specifics of the deal.The CMA finds no reason to block the takeover when it comes to console gaming, which currently accounts for the overwhelming bulk of the $280bn a year global market.Rather it is Microsoft's potential for dominating cloud gaming – widely recognised as the future once current technical and capacity constraints are overcome – that the CMA worries about.Those concerns are instructed by the network effects of Microsoft's already market leading positions in operating systems and cloud computing, and rightly so in some respects.Furthermore, tech giants such as Microsoft are notorious for gobbling up innovative players in order to snuff out potential future competition.Yet in effectively deciding that big tech should be banned from future takeovers, the CMA's Sarah Cardell has in essence substituted her own judgement for that of the markets, where for the moment there is no competition issue of significance.Truth be told, the CMA has as little idea as you and me how these markets might evolve.The only two significant complainants were Sony and Google, both of whom have skin in the game, and are not averse to using regulators to protect their own incumbent positions.I note that Ian Livingstone, who as co-founder of Games Workshop can reasonably claim to be the godfather of British gaming, seems relatively unconcerned about Microsoft's ambitions.Indeed, many UK content providers see Microsoft's assault on cloud gaming as more of an opportunity than a threat, opening up potentially vast new markets beyond the exclusivity and anti-competitive practices of consoles.Let's protect consumers from egregious big tech by all means, but not on the basis of imagined threats or at the expense of desperately needed investment in UK tech.","April 29, 2023 at 7:00 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/brexit-ushered-nanny-state-120000446.html,The Telegraph,0.13636363636363635,0.45454545454545453,0.1375311196739768,0.4532376353804925,2023-04-29 07:00:00,2023-04-29 07:00:00,,,

ATVI,It makes no sense: Activision CEO Bobby Kotick slams U.K. blocking of $69 billion Microsoft deal as clearly irrational,"“Cloud gaming is an inconsequential part of the business,” he insisted, adding that mobile gaming accounted for a much larger proportion of the industry.“The idea that somehow [the CMA is] protecting all of these big, foreign competitors from market competition makes no sense,” he said, noting that Microsoft had made it clear it would continue to provide cloud gaming content to other providers after the deal.Kotick also suggested that rather than standing in the way of innovation, the Microsoft-Activision deal would have enhanced it.“The opportunity we have with Microsoft is to give them more access to mobile talent, mobile technology, and that is something they saw as incredibly valuable,” he said. “There is an enormous amount of talent at Microsoft, that if we were to have access to, would allow us to grow even better.”Kotick’s criticism of the U.K. government came as Microsoft’s president, Brad Smith, also lashed out at the country’s blocking of its deal.He had earlier said in a statement that the CMA’s decision appeared to reflect “a flawed understanding of this market and the way the relevant cloud technology actually works.”Both Microsoft and Activision have said they will appeal the CMA’s decision.“We have every expectation, as does Microsoft, that we should prevail in an appeal,” Kotick told Bloomberg on Thursday. “We think the appeals process will work in our favor.”Microsoft and Activision’s purchase agreement has a July deadline.

ATVI,Microsoft's 'good guy' approach frays in UK gaming battle,"Microsoft's charm offensive with the world's governments is starting to lose some of its luster as the software giant is confronting its toughest antitrust scrutiny since co-founder Bill Gates was in charge.Microsoft's policy chief responded by calling it a “bad day for Britain” that could make it an unattractive place to do business and warned Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's government “it needs to look hard” at the role of its antitrust regulator.“This decision, I have to say, is probably the darkest day in our four decades in Britain,"" the company's president, Brad Smith, told BBC Radio 4. ""It does more than shake our confidence in the future of the opportunity to grow a technology business in Britain than we’ve ever confronted before.”The sharp tone marked a shift for Microsoft, and Smith in particular, who joined the company in 1993 and helped defend it from antitrust enforcers in the U.S. and Europe who targeted the company's personal computer software empire centered around the Windows operating system.“Basically, this is Microsoft and Brad Smith throwing their toys out of the pram after they didn’t get the decision they wanted after all the lobbying they did,” said Max von Thun, director of the Europe office of the Open Markets Institute, a proponent of stronger antitrust enforcement.After legal battles starting in the late 1990s, Microsoft came close to having to break up its business but ended up agreeing to concessions instead. It was eclipsed for a time by rivals like Google, Facebook and Amazon, which drew closer scrutiny from both Wall Street and regulators. Now, it’s back, both as a powerhouse in sectors such as artificial intelligence and cloud computing and as a target for antitrust enforcement.“They’re struggling to maintain that ‘good guy’ reputation,” von Thun said.After adopting a confrontational attitude toward regulators at the turn of the century, Microsoft's senior leaders, led by Smith, have spent years crafting a friendlier and collaborative approach, said William Kovacic, former chair of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.“That generated a great deal of goodwill for them around the world,"" Kovacic said. ”They’re seen as being in a different category than the other well-known information technology giants. They’re seen as being more reasonable, thoughtful.""But it’s not just Microsoft that has changed. Behind the heightened attention on technology companies is a belief that regulators were too weak over the past two decades in preventing monopolies. Kovacic said the “halo effect” of pitching itself as a good partner with governments only goes so far if the regulator believes a deal could harm competition. Not only that, but some of the dozens of nations with antitrust laws are increasingly talking with each other.“A number of jurisdictions are coming to realize that their effectiveness increases if they operate as a coalition,” Kovacic said. “They share thoughts about strategy. They share thoughts about timing.”In his comments to the BBC, Smith said the “English Channel has never seemed wider” as he compared the United Kingdom unfavorably with regulators for the 27-nation European Union, who are due to make a decision on the Activision deal in May.Smith said that “people are shocked, people are disappointed” by the U.K. decision. Microsoft and Activision have vowed to appeal.The company may end up with a more favorable ruling in Brussels, but Microsoft still has to contend with the FTC, which has challenged the deal in the U.S. and is taking the company to trial in August.“We're not alone,” Sarah Cardell, chief executive of Britain's Competition and Markets Authority, told BBC 4's Today program of her agency's decision and the pending FTC lawsuit. “There is a lot of alignment there.”Cardell defended the decision, saying the U.K. is “absolutely open for business"" and the regulator wants “to create an environment where a whole host of different companies can compete effectively, can grow and innovate.""The regulator's concern was over cloud gaming, or games streamed over the internet, which represents a tiny fraction of the industry today but where Microsoft, owner of the Xbox game system, already has the most powerful platform and would become more so with the Activision takeover, making it harder for other platforms to compete, Cardell said.Macquarie Group analyst Sarah Hindlian-Bowler said it will “be challenging, but possible” for Microsoft to complete its Activision takeover without the U.K.'s support. She also said it made sense for Smith to call out the CMA, a relatively new body formed several years before Britain's exit from the EU.“Microsoft is dancing an incredibly delicate ballet,” Hindlian-Bowler said. ""I think the aggressive comments from Microsoft really are intended to get British lawmakers and the British people to be really aware that this body, that I think is attempting to do good, may actually do more to set the U.K. back.""Microsoft also has faced other scrutiny, including complaints to European regulators that it is leveraging its position to lock customers into its Azure computing platform or bundling its Teams communications software with the rest of its Office suite of workplace products. And while Microsoft has endorsed broad AI safeguards, the rapid commercialization of ChatGPT-like products could bring about conflicts for the company amid a growing push to rein in the technology.—————————AP writer Kelvin Chan in London contributed to this report.","April 27, 2023 at 3:09 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microsofts-good-guy-approach-frays-200915630.html,AP Finance,0.7,0.6000000000000001,0.05292446524064172,0.4629957664884135,2023-04-27 15:09:00,2023-04-27 15:09:00,77.16999816894531,77.61000061035156,-0.44000244140625

At an all-hands meeting for division employees Thursday morning, Microsoft gaming chief Phil Spencer acknowledged the company’s disappointment, saying the UK’s decision will slow the approval process, according to a person who attended the meeting. Still, he said Microsoft’s desire to pursue the deal hasn’t wavered, said the person, who asked not to be identified discussing an internal event.Spencer told staffers that Microsoft President Brad Smith was up at 2 a.m. Seattle time Wednesday drafting a response to the UK Competition and Markets Authority. He said Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood, who oversees acquisitions, held a senior leadership meeting the same day.The Xbox chief said the acquisition was intended to speed up Microsoft’s gaming plans, but doesn’t represent the entirety of the company’s gaming strategy, which would move ahead even without Activision, the person said.The CMA said concerns about the deal couldn’t be solved by remedies such as the sale of blockbuster title Call of Duty or other solutions involving promises to permit rivals to offer the game on their platforms, according to a statement Wednesday. Microsoft said it will appeal the decision.Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft had no immediate comment on the internal meeting.Read more: Activision CEO Kotick Says Focus Is on Microsoft Merger AppealMost Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekHow a Dishwasher Engineer Challenged Elon Musk’s Grip on Commercial SpaceTwitter’s Unpaid Bills Threaten to Be an Even Bigger Problem for Elon MuskToo Big to Fail, But Not Too Big to Bail Out Other BanksThe Company Behind Ben Shapiro Is Trying to Build a Right-Wing Magic KingdomCadillac’s Lyriq EV Might Be a Winner If GM Can Build Enough of Them©2023 Bloomberg L.P.","April 27, 2023 at 1:22 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-xbox-chief-seeks-reassure-182235911.html,Bloomberg,-0.4,0.4,-0.04,0.3443333333333334,2023-04-27 13:22:00,2023-04-27 13:22:00,77.16999816894531,77.61000061035156,-0.44000244140625

ATVI,FTC chair met UK antitrust officials last week but did not talk deals,"WASHINGTON, April 27 (Reuters) - Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan met with the heads of other antitrust enforcers, including Britain's, last week but no mergers were discussed, according to an FTC official who spoke amid allegations the FTC and UK are working together to block Microsoft's bid for Activision.On Wednesday, Britain's Competition and Markets Authority blocked Microsoft's $69 billion deal to buy ""Call of Duty"" maker Activision Blizzard, saying it could hit competition in the nascent cloud gaming market.The FTC official, speaking on Thursday, was responding to comments made by the game-maker's CEO, Bobby Kotick, who told CNBC he believed that the U.S. agency had pushed Britain's CMA to stop the planned acquisition.The FTC has filed a complaint to block the deal.

ATVI,Microsofts $69 Billion Deal Tripped Up by Niche Gaming Market,"(Bloomberg) -- UK regulators blocked Microsoft Corp.’s $69 billion purchase of Activision Blizzard Inc. over concerns it would harm competition in cloud gaming, a small but growing segment of the industry.Most Read from BloombergChina Takes the Yuan Global in Bid to Repel a Weaponized DollarZelenskiy Denies Ukraine Sent Drones to Hit Putin, KremlinTD, First Horizon End $13 Billion Merger as Regulators StallBank Drama Rages On; Apple Climbs in Late Trading: Markets WrapPacWest Is Weighing Strategic Options, Including Possible SaleAnalysts expressed surprise Wednesday that UK regulators would move to thwart a deal in a nascent field where companies are still finding their footing. Cloud gaming is dwarfed by the larger console-based business.The UK Competition and Markets Authority ruled Wednesday that Activision titles like Call of Duty would bolster Microsoft’s edge over rivals in cloud gaming, threatening growth in the sector. The companies plan to appeal.Titles like World of Warcraft and Overwatch “will be important for the competitive offering of cloud gaming services as the market continues to grow and develop,” the authority said in a statement. The regulator concluded that under Microsoft, Activision wouldn’t have enough incentive to seed its games across multiple services.The UK decision could ultimately stop the deal if Microsoft is unable to win on appeal. The merger agreement expires on July 18, though it can be extended. The breakup fee is $3 billion.Read The CMA Statement HereAnalysts were baffled that concerns over the evolution of cloud-based play could prove fatal to the biggest-ever deal in gaming. After three years, Alphabet Inc.’s Google shuttered its Stadia cloud-gaming offering in January, while Amazon.com Inc.’s Luna has seen dozens of games leave its subscription service.Regulators more often focus on deals that threaten competition in mature, developed markets. But the UK action Wednesday reflects a growing emphasis on deals that could impede rivalry in the future. The Federal Trade Commission, for example, didn’t challenge Facebook’s $1 billion acquisition of Instagram in 2012 and was criticized later for letting the world’s largest social network eliminate what probably would have become a major competitor. These days, regulators are increasingly focused on emerging industries, like cancer detection and virtual reality.Cloud-based gaming services generated just $5.1 billion in 2022 revenue, while console-game sales amounted to nearly $35 billion, according to research firm Omdia.Read More: Microsoft’s Activision Deal Chances Evaporate After UK Blow“It’s just not a big market,” said Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, citing cloud gaming’s volatility and potential to change. “It doesn’t make sense that Microsoft would keep nascent cloud gaming services that haven’t even been imagined yet from launching by locking up content.”He compared the agency’s reasoning to the idea that no other streaming service could compete with Netflix Inc.Cloud gaming involves streaming from data centers to devices, including mobile phones and smart TVs. Some analysts and executives argue the market could one day eat into gaming consoles’ market share by increasing access to top-tier games on less sophisticated hardware. Success in the market depends in part on the strength of gaming services’ catalogs, the CMA said.While standalone cloud gaming services have struggled to penetrate the mainstream gaming market, Microsoft’s Game Pass subscription service, which has a cloud gaming offering, is popular and growing.As part of a Netflix-for-games approach, Microsoft charges 25 million-plus Game Pass subscribers $10 to $15 a month to play over 400 games across the Xbox game console, Microsoft’s Windows PC operating system, smart TVs, tablets and smartphones. The Game Pass’s highest-tier offering lets users stream games from Microsoft’s international network of data centers to their phones with Xbox’s beta Cloud Gaming service.Microsoft currently has a 60% to 70% share of the global cloud gaming market, according to the CMA. Sony Group Corp. has a parallel offering, PlayStation Plus. Although PlayStation Plus boasts about 46 million subscribers, the service doesn’t offer splashy new releases on their day of launch. Sony also doesn’t own its own data centers.Analysts on Wednesday questioned whether the CMA was making an apples-to-oranges comparison between the Microsoft Game Pass’s cloud offering and those of Amazon, Sony, Nvidia Corp. and others.“I think they’re rather misinformed on what the cloud gaming market is,” said Joost Van Dreunen, who lectures at New York University’s Stern business school. “They’re conflating cloud gaming with the revenue model. Then they’re looking at it as a distinct technology and a market in another sense.”For example, the CMA may be overstating the Game Pass’s role in Microsoft’s cloud gaming dominance when cloud gaming is just one feature of the service.“I don’t think we can compare the way Microsoft uses cloud gaming to the way Amazon uses it for Luna,” said Joost Rietveld, an associate professor of strategy and entrepreneurship at University College London’s School of Management. “The market share is driven by the popularity of Game Pass, not the popularity of cloud gaming within gamers.”It’s an argument that analysts say Microsoft and Activision may invoke when they appeal. Activision on Wednesday called the CMA decision “disproportionate, irrational and inconsistent with the evidence,”UK regulators took the view that Microsoft’s dominance in cloud gaming doesn’t just apply to Game Pass. They cited the company’s network of software, infrastructure and services — ranging from the Xbox console and dozens of game studios to the Windows PC operating system and global chain of data centers.Although Sony leads in console sales, the CMA decided Microsoft’s ecosystem gives it early dominance in cloud gaming. And the agency concluded the company’s recent deals to work with other cloud gaming providers fall short of addressing its concerns.Agency officials have said for at least a year that they would rather err on the side of over-enforcement, since deals are tough to unwind after the fact.Analysts have speculated that cloud gaming could one day compete with console gaming because of the high price of both developing and purchasing gaming consoles.“Cloud gaming remains very much a nascent market, so a decision to block is looking quite far into the future,” said Vili Lehdonvirta, a professor of economic sociology and digital social research at the University of Oxford. “Of course we have existing examples where tech giants have used their dominance in one market to capture another market that’s emerged.”The decision means both companies will have to get more serious about planning a future without the other. Microsoft, for example, has expressed interest in launching a store for mobile games, where Activision’s King division is a big player with titles like Candy Crush.(Corrects spelling of Joost Rietveld in eighteenth paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekHow a Dishwasher Engineer Challenged Elon Musk’s Grip on Commercial SpaceTwitter’s Unpaid Bills Threaten to Be an Even Bigger Problem for Elon MuskToo Big to Fail, But Not Too Big to Bail Out Other BanksThe Company Behind Ben Shapiro Is Trying to Build a Right-Wing Magic KingdomCadillac’s Lyriq EV Might Be a Winner If GM Can Build Enough of Them©2023 Bloomberg L.P.","April 27, 2023 at 9:46 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-69-billion-deal-tripped-192015703.html,Bloomberg,0.0,0.0,0.017076917456664304,0.39940681681188,2023-04-27 09:46:00,2023-04-27 09:46:00,77.16999816894531,77.61000061035156,-0.44000244140625

ATVI,Big Tech Has Formidable Foe in Britains Antitrust Watchdog After Microsoft Blow,"(Bloomberg) -- The UK’s surprise decision to stop the Microsoft Corp. $69 billion Activision Blizzard Inc. deal in its tracks shows a more muscular approach to deal enforcement that’s come into its own since Brexit.Most Read from BloombergChina Takes the Yuan Global in Bid to Repel a Weaponized DollarZelenskiy Denies Ukraine Sent Drones to Hit Putin, KremlinTD, First Horizon End $13 Billion Merger as Regulators StallPacWest Is Weighing Strategic Options, Including Possible SaleBank Drama Rages On; Apple Climbs in Late Trading: Markets WrapThe final ruling deals a blow to Microsoft’s chances of securing the world’s biggest gaming takeover and puts the Competition and Markets Authority at the center of global antitrust alongside the US and the EU. Wednesday’s decision is globally binding and the road to approval looks to be hard slog.“The Microsoft-Activision decision is another clear example of the CMA establishing itself firmly as one of the most important competition enforcers on the world stage in the post-Brexit world,” Pinar Akman, a competition professor at the University of Leeds, said.It’s the second, but by far the biggest, Big Tech tie-up that the CMA has blocked after ending Meta Platforms Inc. chances of buying GIF search engine Giphy. These decisions have cut across criticism that it hasn’t done enough in the past to get to grips with nascent tech industries being snapped up by a handful of major players. Failings that may have led to Meta’s takeover of Whatsapp and Instagram.In another show of post-Brexit strength, this week the UK introduced new laws to parliament that will further boost its powers to clamp down on tech dominance and help benefit the country’s consumers. It includes new digital competition rules and regulations that will designate a handful of tech companies as having “strategic market status.”“Preventing the development of entrenched market power in the first place is the most effective way to safeguard competition,” Sarah Cardell, the CMA’s chief executive officer, said on Wednesday. “Merger control therefore has a critical role to play in driving productivity and growth in the UK.”Oxford University-educated Cardell is the first woman to ever run the UK’s watchdog since she took over the role in December. Three women are now the faces of global antitrust with Lina Khan’s US Federal Trade Commission and Margrethe Vestager at the European Commission.The CMA’s confidence in its mergers system has drawn criticism that the agency has become too interventionist and may put off international businesses. Leaders at both Microsoft and Activision blasted the decision on Wednesday as being bad for business and investment in the UK.Closed for Business“The CMA’s report contradicts the ambitions of the UK to become an attractive country to build technology businesses,” an Activision spokesperson said. “Global innovators large and small will take note that - despite all its rhetoric - the UK is clearly closed for business.”Analysis from law firm Linklaters shows that of the deals subject to an in-depth probe, 64% have failed over the last three-and-a-half years compared with 34% of deals scrutinized by the CMA between 2014 and 2017.Cardell, a former competition partner at elite London firm Slaughter and May, deflected the criticism arguing that the idea the agency is too interventionist is misplaced and it’s just doing its job to protect the UK. She said that of the 12 to 14 deals that are referred to an in-depth probe from hundreds annually, only a handful of those are blocked.For now, all eyes turn to what the European Commission will do next month and how Microsoft defends itself before the UK’s Competition Appeal Tribunal — a fight that will take many months to resolve. The CAT also rarely rules against the watchdog in merger probe reviews.“The CMA is taking on a leadership role in Big Tech merger control,” Anne Witt, a law professor at the EDHEC Business School, said. “If the CMA wins this, it will create precedent and the message to the Big Tech industry will be clear — times are changing and the days of unconstrained acquisition sprees are over.”(Updates with biography details of CMA’s Sarah Cardell in the sixth and 11th paragraphs)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekTwitter’s Unpaid Bills Threaten to Be an Even Bigger Problem for Elon MuskHow a Dishwasher Engineer Challenged Elon Musk’s Grip on Commercial SpaceToo Big to Fail, But Not Too Big to Bail Out Other BanksThe Company Behind Ben Shapiro Is Trying to Build a Right-Wing Magic KingdomCadillac’s Lyriq EV Might Be a Winner If GM Can Build Enough of Them©2023 Bloomberg L.P.","April 27, 2023 at 6:35 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/big-tech-formidable-foe-britain-060000022.html,Bloomberg,0.0,0.1,0.030755583554091026,0.39591867502315264,2023-04-27 06:35:00,2023-04-27 06:35:00,77.16999816894531,77.61000061035156,-0.44000244140625

It is understood that he has not been a member of any political party for over 30 years.Coleman previously chaired a panel that made the surprise decision to block the merger of airline software companies Sabre and Farelogix, despite them not having any direct UK customers. The CMA panel argued that the businesses’ software affected passengers flying in and out of the UK and said that a combination would hurt innovation.Coleman has made clear that he is open to criticism from the companies he adjudicates.Speaking to the Law Society last year, he said: “We expect parties to tell us when they think we are wrong and we expect them to tell us this in clear language.”","April 27, 2023 at 2:15 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/former-labour-council-leader-helped-071530148.html,The Telegraph,0.0,0.0,0.06083333333333335,0.34458333333333335,2023-04-27 02:15:00,2023-04-27 02:15:00,77.16999816894531,77.61000061035156,-0.44000244140625

ATVI,Microsoft hits back at UK after Activision acquisition blocked,"By Paul SandleLONDON (Reuters) - Microsoft's president Brad Smith said the UK regulator's decision to prevent its acquisition of 'Call of Duty' maker Activision Blizzard ""had shaken confidence"" in Britain as a destination for tech businesses.The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), which operates independently from government, blocked the deal on Wednesday, saying it could hit competition in the nascent cloud gaming market.Microsoft hit back on Thursday, saying it was ""probably the darkest day in our four decades in Britain"" and sent the wrong message to the global tech industry about the UK.""If the government of the United Kingdom wants to bring in investment, if it wants to create jobs (...) it needs to look hard at the role of the CMA, the regulatory structure in the United Kingdom, this transaction, and the message that the United Kingdom has just said to the world,"" he told BBC radio.A spokesman for British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said Smith's comments were ""not borne out by the facts"".""We continue to believe that the UK has an extremely attractive tech sector and a growing games market,"" he said. ""We will continue to engage proactively with Microsoft and other companies.""Smith said Microsoft had worked effectively with regulators in Brussels but not in London, which he said refuted Britain's claim that it would be more flexible after Brexit.The company had answered the CMA's questions, he said, and it had told them to come back with any more concerns. ""They went silent, we heard nothing from them,"" he said.""There's a clear message here - the European Union is a more attractive place to start a business if you want some day to sell it than the United Kingdom,"" he added.But CMA Chief Executive Sarah Cardell said the regulator's role was to make sure Britain was a competitive environment for businesses to be able to grow and thrive.""The decision that the CMA takes is an independent decision that we reached looking at an overall assessment of the impact of the deal on competition, and we think that is the right decision for the UK,"" she said.She noted the U.S. Federal Trade Commission was also pressing for the deal to be blocked on competition grounds.Microsoft said yesterday it would appeal, with ""aggressive"" support from Activision.Appeals against CMA rulings are heard by the Competition Appeals Tribunal, which makes a judgment on the merits of the decision.

ATVI,Microsoft Stock Soars After UK Regulators Block Activision Deal,"In January 2022, when Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) first announced it had struck a deal worth $69 billion to acquire popular video game developer Activision Blizzard Inc. (NASDAQ:ATVI), investors applauded the news. It seemed like a perfect way to utilize Microsofts $104 billion cash hoard, as it would strengthen the company's already significant position in the gaming industry and help reduce competition.MSFT 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of MSFTPeter Lynch Chart of MSFTThe first regulatory hurdle to the deal came on Dec. 8, 2022, when the U.S. Federal Trade Commission sued to block Microsoft and Activisions combination. The markets did not have much of a reaction to the development at all, and Microsofts shares rose just 1% that day, which is well within the realm of normal daily fluctuations.However, it appears that investor sentiment may have changed since then. On April 26, when the U.K. Competition and Markets Authority voted to block the deal on anti-competitive grounds, Microsoft shares soared more than 7%, even as Activision was down 11%.Just what was it that changed investors outlook on Microsoft and Activision to the point where optimism for Microsoft soared following a major blow to what could have been a blockbuster value-accretive deal?For one, some investors were already certain that regulators would succeed in blocking the deal and had factored that into their valuations, so they may have been discounting Microsoft as a result. Another thing to consider is that, as the economic outlook in general and Activisions outlook in particular have worsened, fears began to crop up that Microsoft might be over-paying. Lastly, but perhaps most importantly, Microsoft had reported positive earnings results the previous morning, so there may have been some leftover trading enthusiasm from that, even though the share price did drop the day of the earnings report.Regulatory opposition was not unexpectedFrom the moment Microsoft declared its intention to acquire Activision, it was clear there would likely be some form of opposition from regulators. In addition to being the third-largest maker of game consoles with its Xbox, Microsoft also dominates the PC gaming market and is buying its way into mobile games. Microsoft even has 23 in-house game development studios for Xbox, PC and mobile.The gaming community was quick to point out that Microsoft would have both the means and the incentive to make Activisions games lower quality on competitors platforms. Microsoft tried to placate gamers and regulators by promising not to take such actions, but the fact remains that even if it signed contracts to that effect, those contracts would expire and new games would be developed that the contracts did not cover.Thus, some investors may have taken a cautious approach on Microsoft due to fears that a regulatory block on the Activision deal could hurt the share price. That may be why the first regulatory blow did not move the stock much, and the second blow validated the view that the deal would likely be successfully blocked in the end, though nothing is set in stone yet.Pressured earnings lower Activisions perceived valueEven if a good chunk of investors were just waiting for the Activision acquisition to be blocked, why did that become such a positive development for Microsoft in the markets eyes? To help answer this question, lets take a look at Activisions quarterly revenue and earnings per share numbers:As we can see, Activisions earnings per share are down since the acquisition was announced, though revenue per share has grown. There is a general expectation that people are likely to spend less money on games when the economy is struggling, which is hurting Activisions outlook as fears arise that Microsoft may be paying too high of a price tag.Additionally, even Microsofts fortress-like balance sheet would take a hit from a $69 billion all-cash acquisition. Its strong balance sheet has always worked in Microsofts favor, so why would it put that in jeopardy, especially in a rising interest rate environment?Did positive earnings play a role?There is also a chance that Microsofts positive earnings report from the day before impacted the April 26 price movement. For its third quarter of fiscal 2023, the company reported revenue was up 7% year over year while earnings per share grew 10%, both beating analysts expectations.Microsofts share price actually dropped slightly during normal trading hours on earnings day, but it spiked sharply in after-hours trading. The U.K. is five hours ahead of New York time, so it is actually difficult to discern whether the price spike was due to the regulatory announcement, a vast amount of in-the-money options being automatically exercised at the markets closing price (as is always a danger with a heavily-traded stock like Microsoft) or a combination of the two.Will the deal really be blocked?Despite regulatory pushback, Microsoft is one of the most powerful publicly traded companies in the world, so it is possible the Activision deal may go through after all. The company has already shown it is willing to go to lengths such as a decade-long contract with Samsung Electronics (XKRX:005930) to make Call of Duty releases available on the same day for PlayStation and Xbox. It will probably take a lot more than that to satisfy regulators, but if Microsoft is willing to make enough concessions, it might have a chance.Overall, I do not think it matters one way or another for Microsofts long-term results. Anti-competitive acquisitions can sometimes be less valuable than anticipated because they essentially boil down to paying money for a development that slows down overall industry growth, which extends the break-even timeline.","April 26, 2023 at 4:41 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-stock-soars-uk-regulators-214116015.html,GuruFocus.com,0.0,0.0,0.12132113257113261,0.4731781181781183,2023-04-26 16:41:00,2023-04-26 16:41:00,79.0999984741211,76.80999755859375,2.2900009155273438

EA,3 Attractive Large-Caps Worth Investors' Attention,"There is a wide variety of investing styles out there, whether that be value-focused or targeting a specific industry.Of course, some also prefer to tailor their investing style to target primarily large-cap stocks.Large-cap stocks are a staple in almost every portfolio. They are well-established, have more analyst coverage, and frequently pay dividends, all undeniably significant benefits that make them so popular among investors.For those with an appetite for large-caps, three companies – Kroger Co. KR, PPG Industries PPG, and Electronic Arts EA – have all seen their near-term earnings outlook shift positively and carry solid projected growth.Below is a chart illustrating the performance of each year-to-date, with the S&P 500 blended in as a benchmark.Kroger Co. Founded in 1883, the long-time retailer operates approximately 2,700 retail stores under various banners and divisions in 35 states. The stock presently carries a favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Shares aren’t stretched in terms of valuation, with the current 10.9X forward earnings multiple sitting nicely beneath the 12.4X five-year median and the Zacks Retail and Wholesale sector average.KR sports a Style Score of “A” for Value.For those seeking an income stream, KR shares have that covered; the company’s annual dividend currently yields 2.1%, with its payout growing by an impressive 15% over the last five years.KR shares have also recently experienced the ‘Golden Cross,’ as we can see illustrated in the chart below. The Golden Cross occurs when the shorter 50-day moving average rises above the 200-day moving average. Electronic ArtsElectronic Arts is a leading developer, marketer, publisher, and distributor of video game software and content. Currently, the stock is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).EA posted better-than-expected results in its latest release, snapping a streak of negative surprises. The company reported earnings per share of $1.77 on $1.9 billion in revenue, reflecting a 35% EPS beat and a 13% sales surprise.In addition, it’s hard to ignore the company’s growth profile, with earnings forecasted to soar 23.5% in its current fiscal year (FY24) and an additional double-digit 10.4% in FY25. Top line growth is also apparent, with sales forecasted to climb 3.7% and 7.5% in FY24 and FY25, respectively.PPG Industries  PPG Industries is a global supplier of paints, coatings, chemicals, specialty materials, glass, and fiberglass. Shares have recently broken out of a year-long range, with prior resistance now becoming a support level.Like Kroger, PPG has had little issue increasingly rewarding its shareholders, boosting its dividend payout by nearly 7% over the last five years. Shares currently yield 1.7% annually, below the Zacks Basic Materials sector average by a fair margin.Bottom LineLarge-cap stocks can help bring stability to a portfolio, as these stocks are typically less volatile. In addition, they commonly pay dividends and carry a well-established nature, further perks that make them beloved among investors.And all three above – Kroger Co. KR, PPG Industries PPG, and Electronic Arts EA – could be considerations for those seeking large-caps with improved near-term earnings outlooks.PPG Industries, Inc.

EA,Here's What's Concerning About Electronic Arts' (NASDAQ:EA) Returns On Capital,"For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Electronic Arts is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities) Check out our latest analysis for Electronic Arts On the surface, the trend of ROCE at Electronic Arts doesn't inspire confidence. To be more specific, ROCE has fallen from 24% over the last five years. However it looks like Electronic Arts might be reinvesting for long term growth because while capital employed has increased, the company's sales haven't changed much in the last 12 months. It's worth keeping an eye on the company's earnings from here on to see if these investments do end up contributing to the bottom line.In summary, Electronic Arts is reinvesting funds back into the business for growth but unfortunately it looks like sales haven't increased much just yet. Unsurprisingly then, the total return to shareholders over the last five years has been flat. On the whole, we aren't too inspired by the underlying trends and we think there may be better chances of finding a multi-bagger elsewhere.","May 18, 2023 at 9:11 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-whats-concerning-electronic-arts-141123524.html,Simply Wall St.,0.0,0.0,0.12236842105263158,0.3915204678362573,2023-05-18 09:11:00,2023-05-18 09:11:00,125.4000015258789,126.20999908447266,-0.80999755859375

EA,"Roblox losses swell in Q1, Electronic Arts posts earnings beat","Yahoo Finance Live anchors Julie Hyman and Brad Smith discuss stock performance for Roblox and Electronic Arts following quarterly earnings.So let's just take these quickly one by one here. If you look at those Roblox numbers, it looks like users did improve here. First quarter daily active users, 66.1 million. That is ahead of estimates here. And that was even though the company had said earlier in the year that users fell in March from February.But if you look at the first quarter overall, you saw some improvement there. EBITDA down 22%. That came in below estimates. So initially, again, we did see a decline there. But now the shares have turned around.One thing that stuck out to me was the commentary from EA Sports CEO Andrew Wilson saying that ""interactive entertainment right now is at an inflection point here."" And you think about a couple of the themes that we've heard about over the course of the past year that are certainly changing the course for these companies at large, and you can even weave, of course, Take-Two Interactive into this conversation, but things like the metaverse and where immersive technology are going to change the gaming structure, where cloud has already really disrupted where the access to that game takes place. And that even changes the type of device or console that you're using. And console was the last thing that I had written down as well within this.And so with the disruption, with the inflection that-- inflection point that the industry is at as a whole, there's going to be so much more focus on not just how quickly a lot of these companies can create titles and perhaps where they can leverage artificial intelligence to write more quickly some of that code for the experience, but also where that experience takes place and how much each of these companies have to buy into developing specifically for where gamers are most apt to have that console experience or cloud-based experience based on the device that they want to use as well.","May 10, 2023 at 8:43 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/roblox-losses-swell-q1-electronic-134301246.html,Yahoo Finance Video,0.0,0.0,0.11986446093588952,0.3927437641723356,2023-05-10 08:43:00,2023-05-10 08:43:00,129.32000732421875,124.73999786376952,4.580009460449233

EA,Electronic Arts Inc.'s (NASDAQ:EA) Has Had A Decent Run On The Stock market: Are Fundamentals In The Driver's Seat?,"Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. Check out our latest analysis for Electronic Arts Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Electronic Arts is:14% = US$1.0b ÷ US$7.6b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.14 in profit.We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.At first glance, Electronic Arts seems to have a decent ROE. And on comparing with the industry, we found that the the average industry ROE is similar at 14%. However, while Electronic Arts has a pretty respectable ROE, its five year net income decline rate was 9.0% . We reckon that there could be some other factors at play here that are preventing the company's growth. For example, it could be that the company has a high payout ratio or the business has allocated capital poorly, for instance.That being said, we compared Electronic Arts' performance with the industry and were concerned when we found that while the company has shrunk its earnings, the industry has grown its earnings at a rate of 17% in the same period.Electronic Arts' low three-year median payout ratio of 22% (implying that it retains the remaining 78% of its profits) comes as a surprise when you pair it with the shrinking earnings. The low payout should mean that the company is retaining most of its earnings and consequently, should see some growth. So there could be some other explanations in that regard. For example, the company's business may be deteriorating.Only recently, Electronic Arts stated paying a dividend. This likely means that the management might have concluded that its shareholders have a strong preference for dividends. Existing analyst estimates suggest that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 10% over the next three years. Accordingly, the expected drop in the payout ratio explains the expected increase in the company's ROE to 26%, over the same period.","May 3, 2023 at 6:47 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/electronic-arts-inc-nasdaq-ea-114705656.html,Simply Wall St.,0.16666666666666666,0.6666666666666666,0.08583333333333333,0.4346794871794871,2023-05-03 06:47:00,2023-05-03 06:47:00,126.30999755859376,125.06999969482422,1.2399978637695455
EA,12 Best Video Game Stocks to Buy Now,"“Selling plenty of product may be a great outcome for GPU vendors, but the artificial price inflation caused by stock shortages is a less welcome look for any mainstream company [...] The company’s true customers – the end users who were after the product in the first place – end up feeling outmaneuvered by and aggrieved at the company itself, not the buyers who flipped for quick money.”Our MethodologyFor our list of best video game stocks, we chose the 12 video game companies listed on NYSE and NASDAQ based on their hedge fund sentiment as of the fourth quarter of 2022. The chosen companies are either entirely focused on gaming, have a separate gaming division in the company, or provide products that are focused on the gaming industry.The hedge fund sentiment around each stock has been taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 943 elite hedge funds.Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 28Sony Group Corporation (NYSE:SONY) released its Q4 results on April 28, where it reported a GAAP EPS of ¥103.53 (1 Japanese Yen = 0.0073 USD) and revenue of ¥3.06 trillion, up 35.3% YoY. For FY 2024, the company provided revenue guidance of ¥11.5 trillion and ¥840 billion for net income.“Sony Group Corporation (NYSE:SONY), the global provider of video games and consoles, image sensors, and music, as well as movies, was a major detractor for the period. The share price of the company has struggled this year following its strong performance in 2021. Signs of a slowdown in the gaming industry (as people seem inclined to take on outdoor activities as pandemic fears have subsided), combined with sales of its PlayStation 5 that have been held up by a global parts shortage, have led to gaming‐related software sales falling more than 20% year‐over‐year. Rather than focusing on short‐term demand dislocations, we focus on the company’s ability to continue migrating videogame users toward the firm’s subscription offerings, as well as its capacity to leverage content across its video, music and gaming platforms. We are also impressed with the expansion of Sony’s Music segment, which has been supported by the pervasiveness of streaming services. Management’s ongoing work to improve the company’s TV and film studios is bearing fruit as well, with sales growing 67% year‐over‐year for its Pictures segment as its regional strategy has taken hold, including recent progress made toward solidifying a merger plan with India‐based Zee Entertainment. All of this is to say we remain excited by the oligopolistic nature of the businesses Sony operates in, and the future prospects for the company given its leadership in image sensors, music publishing and gaming consoles.”Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 29Roblox Corporation (NYSE:RBLX) is a California-based gaming and multimedia company. It runs an online game creation system where the users can create games and play games created by other users.

In March, Roblox Corporation (NYSE:RBLX)’s platform had 66.2 million daily active users, showing a 26% YoY rise. The users engaged for a total of 4.8 billion hours, representing an increase of 26% YoY. Finally, the estimated revenue was up 15% to 21% YoY while the estimated bookings were up 23% to 27% YoY.“We’ve used this incremental capital strategy with some of our ‘early-stage’ investments such as Roblox Corporation (NYSE:RBLX), Purple Group, Transaction Capital and Karooooo (Cartrack).Today, we would like to discuss one of our early-stage investments, Roblox. While there is a risk that we may be premature, mistaken, or even wrong in our evaluation of this opportunity, we see Roblox as a company with the potential to ‘matter’.Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 31NetEase, Inc.

Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD) with a combined value of nearly $1.35 billion.“Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD) – Media conglomerate Warner Bros Discovery (WBD) was the top contributor in the quarter. WBD was a top detractor last year in the face of concerns over management’s ability to effectively merge two businesses with different cultures, high leverage and exposure to cord cutting. In 2023, a solid plan is emerging for the integration of the businesses. This management team has a strong track record of integrating assets and growing free cash flow (FCF) per share, which is beginning to happen at WBD. Management has guided that the company will likely be below 4 times net debt to EBITDA by the end of 2023 and to 3x or less by the end of 2024, taking WBD out of the penalty box. We have seen this management team successfully execute this playbook before when Discovery bought former Southeastern holding Scripps in 2017.

EA,Electronic Arts (EA) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,"The market expects Electronic Arts (EA) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on May 9, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis video game maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.32 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +11.9%.Revenues are expected to be $1.73 billion, down 1.2% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.93% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Electronic Arts?For Electronic Arts, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +2.08%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Electronic Arts will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Electronic Arts would post earnings of $3.05 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.71, delivering a surprise of -11.15%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Electronic Arts appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Electronic Arts Inc.

EA,Top 20 Entertainment Brands In The World,"In this context, it's critical to examine the leading entertainment brands that have had a big impact on the sector.

This particularly applies to tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.What if you'd invested in Electronic Arts (EA) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to EA for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?Electronic Arts' Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at Electronic Arts' main business drivers.Bottom LineAnyone can invest, but building a successful investment portfolio takes a combination of a few things: research, patience, and a little bit of risk. So, if you had invested in Electronic Arts a decade ago, you're probably feeling pretty good about your investment today.A $1000 investment made in April 2013 would be worth $7,075.50, or a gain of 607.55%, as of April 28, 2023, according to our calculations.

EA,How to Find Strong Consumer Discretionary Stocks Slated for Positive Earnings Surprises,"Wall Street watches a company's quarterly report closely to understand as much as possible about its recent performance and what to expect going forward. Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.Boyd Gaming's Earnings ESP sits at 4.06%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $1.56 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.50.Electronic Arts, which is readying to report earnings on May 9, 2023, sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now. It's Most Accurate Estimate is currently $1.34 a share, and EA is 18 days out from its next earnings report.For Electronic Arts, the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.32 is 1.32%.BYD and EA's positive ESP figures tell us that both stocks have a good chance at beating analyst expectations in their next earnings report.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

TTD,Some Investors May Be Worried About Trade Desk's (NASDAQ:TTD) Returns On Capital,"For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. The formula for this calculation on Trade Desk is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities) See our latest analysis for Trade Desk When we looked at the ROCE trend at Trade Desk, we didn't gain much confidence. Over the last five years, returns on capital have decreased to 5.0% from 29% five years ago. Although, given both revenue and the amount of assets employed in the business have increased, it could suggest the company is investing in growth, and the extra capital has led to a short-term reduction in ROCE. If these investments prove successful, this can bode very well for long term stock performance.On a related note, Trade Desk has decreased its current liabilities to 46% of total assets. So we could link some of this to the decrease in ROCE. Effectively this means their suppliers or short-term creditors are funding less of the business, which reduces some elements of risk. Since the business is basically funding more of its operations with it's own money, you could argue this has made the business less efficient at generating ROCE. Keep in mind 46% is still pretty high, so those risks are still somewhat prevalent.In summary, despite lower returns in the short term, we're encouraged to see that Trade Desk is reinvesting for growth and has higher sales as a result. And long term investors must be optimistic going forward because the stock has returned a huge 671% to shareholders in the last five years. So while the underlying trends could already be accounted for by investors, we still think this stock is worth looking into further.","May 16, 2023 at 7:00 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-may-worried-trade-desks-140027536.html,Simply Wall St.,0.0,0.0,0.11988505747126436,0.474367816091954,2023-05-16 07:00:00,2023-05-16 07:00:00,63.63999938964844,64.13999938964844,-0.5

We expect the variability of the above charges could have a significant and potentially unpredictable impact on our future U.S. GAAP financial results.Use of Non-GAAP Financial InformationIncluded within this press release are the non-GAAP financial measures of Adjusted EBITDA, Non-GAAP Net Income and Non-GAAP Diluted EPS that supplement the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations of The Trade Desk, Inc. (the Company) prepared under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Adjusted EBITDA is earnings before interest expense (income), net; benefit from income taxes; depreciation and amortization; and stock-based compensation. Non-GAAP Net Income excludes charges and the related income tax effects for stock-based compensation. Tax rates on the tax-deductible portions of the stock-based compensation expense approximating 25% to 30% have been used in the computation of non-GAAP Net Income and non-GAAP Diluted EPS. Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP amounts for the periods presented herein are provided in schedules accompanying this release and should be considered together with the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. These non-GAAP measures are not meant as a substitute for GAAP, but are included solely for informational and comparative purposes. The Company's management believes that this information can assist investors in evaluating the Company's operational trends, financial performance, and cash-generating capacity. Management believes these non-GAAP measures allow investors to evaluate the Company’s financial performance using some of the same measures as management. However, the non-GAAP financial measures should not be regarded as a replacement for or superior to corresponding, similarly captioned, GAAP measures and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.First Quarter 2023 Financial Results Webcast and Conference Call DetailsAbout The Trade DeskForward-Looking StatementsTHE TRADE DESK, INC.CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED

TTD,3 Quiet Stocks That AI Predicts Will Surprise Everyone in 2023,"Artificial intelligence has generated quite a lot of buzz in recent months, especially on Wall Street. Stock prices of AI-related companies have skyrocketed, while investors are increasingly looking into AI-powered ETFs that are supposedly better than even human analysts. Because of the growing intrigue into AI-related investing, I was curious to use AI prediction to see which quiet stocks Google’s Bard AI would pitch us.  InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsMe: Hi, Bard! I’m writing an article for InvestorPlace titled “3 Quiet Stocks That AI Predicts Will Surprise Everyone in 2023” Can you provide me with three such candidates that you think will surprise everyone this year?Here’s what Bard picked:Source: Konstantin Savusia / Shutterstock.comBard: “Unity Software is a leading provider of real-time 3D development platform. The company’s platform is used by game developers, artists, architects, filmmakers, and other creative professionals to create interactive 3D content. Unity’s platform is gaining traction in a number of industries, including gaming, e-commerce, and advertising. The company is well-positioned to benefit from the growing demand for 3D content.”In addition, the falling ad revenue has been hurting the Unity ads segment, while indie game development has been dying for the past few years. These indie developers are a significant user base for Unity and make up a large proportion of its sales.I’m also very optimistic about its upcoming earnings call later today.Source: rblfmr / Shutterstock.comBard: “Snowflake is a cloud-based data warehousing company. The company’s platform allows businesses to store and analyze large amounts of data in the cloud. Snowflake’s platform is gaining traction in a number of industries, including finance, healthcare, and retail. The company is well-positioned to benefit from the growing demand for cloud-based data warehousing.”But again, Bard may be correct that it could surprise everyone in 2023!Source: Tada Images / Shutterstock.comBard: “The Trade Desk is a programmatic advertising company. The company’s platform allows advertisers to buy and sell digital advertising space in real time. The Trade Desk’s platform is gaining traction in a number of industries, including retail, media, and technology. The company is well-positioned to benefit from the growing demand for programmatic advertising.”Indeed, the company’s financials have been on a consistent uptrend despite many other digital marketing companies seeing a downfall. The Trade Desk’s sales are projected to continue accelerating along with its earnings, and investors are paying a hefty premium.But again, the Q1 report is underway, and it might surprise everyone with growth near or above 20%. That’s still nowhere near what is needed to sustain such a rich valuation. Buy This $5 Stock BEFORE This Apple Project Goes LiveThe Best $1 Investment You Can Make TodayWall Street Titan: Here’s My #1 Stock for 2023It doesn’t matter if you have $500 or $5 million.

TTD,"Bullish The Trade Desk, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTD) insiders were rewarded last week as their US$802k investment inflated to US$1.1m","While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. See our latest analysis for Trade Desk The Independent Non-Employee Director David Wells made the biggest insider purchase in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$802k worth of shares at a price of US$45.81 each. Although we like to see insider buying, we note that this large purchase was at significantly below the recent price of US$64.34. While it does suggest insiders consider the stock undervalued at lower prices, this transaction doesn't tell us much about what they think of current prices.You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!Many investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. It's great to see that Trade Desk insiders own 9.9% of the company, worth about US$3.1b. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $363.74 million, up 15.35% from the year-ago period.TTD's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $1.16 per share and revenue of $1.88 billion.

TTD,"The Trade Desk, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTD) is favoured by institutional owners who hold 70% of the company","Significantly high institutional ownership implies Trade Desk's stock price is sensitive to their trading actions51% of the business is held by the top 10 shareholdersBecause institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Trade Desk. See our latest analysis for Trade Desk Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Trade Desk. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Trade Desk's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.Institutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Trade Desk. Baillie Gifford & Co. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 9.7% of shares outstanding. With 9.3% and 8.3% of the shares outstanding respectively, Jeffrey Green and The Vanguard Group, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders. Jeffrey Green, who is the second-largest shareholder, also happens to hold the title of Chief Executive Officer.On further inspection, we found that more than half the company's shares are owned by the top 10 shareholders, suggesting that the interests of the larger shareholders are balanced out to an extent by the smaller ones.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.The definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.With a 20% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Trade Desk. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated. This may not be consistent with full year annual report figures.","April 23, 2023 at 4:00 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trade-desk-inc-nasdaq-ttd-110018856.html,Simply Wall St.,0.0,0.0,0.16856787743506496,0.4750852272727273,2023-04-23 04:00:00,2023-04-23 04:00:00,,,

TTD,"The Trade Desk, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:TTD) Stock Has Seen Strong Momentum: Does That Call For Deeper Study Of Its Financial Prospects?","Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. View our latest analysis for Trade Desk Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Trade Desk is:2.5% = US$53m ÷ US$2.1b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.03 in profit.We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.It is hard to argue that Trade Desk's ROE is much good in and of itself. Even when compared to the industry average of 13%, the ROE figure is pretty disappointing. Although, we can see that Trade Desk saw a modest net income growth of 9.6% over the past five years. Therefore, the growth in earnings could probably have been caused by other variables. Such as - high earnings retention or an efficient management in place.Next, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Trade Desk's growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 6.1% in the same period, which is great to see.Trade Desk doesn't pay any dividend, meaning that all of its profits are being reinvested in the business, which explains the fair bit of earnings growth the company has seen.","April 19, 2023, 7:00 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trade-desk-inc-nasdaq-ttd-140019298.html,Simply Wall St.,0.21666666666666665,0.36666666666666664,0.11752380952380954,0.47438095238095235,2023-04-19 07:00:00,2023-04-19 07:00:00,60.93000030517578,61.61000061035156,-0.6800003051757812

ZG,25 Hardest Places To Sell a Home,"The average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage increased to 6.73% in the first week of this month, according to Freddie Mac's benchmark rate analysis. Just a year ago, the 30-year fixed rate was 3.89%. According to the National Association of Realtors (NAR), the median existing-home sales price went up 1.3% to $359,000 in January compared to January 2022.To help locate housing markets that may be in distress, GOBankingRates analyzed the 190 largest metropolitan housing markets according to Zillow's Housing Data and found the 25 hardest places to sell a home. Primary factors considered were the difference between list and sale prices, average price cut and average number of days on Zillow.More From GOBankingRates10 Aldi Brand Products Worth BuyingSee GOBankingRates' Top 100 Most Influential Money Experts and Get Advice3 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,00048 Easy Things You Can Do To Live Better and Save MoneyMethodology: GOBankingRates analyzed the 190 largest metropolitan housing markets for which Zillow provides complete data to find the 25 hardest places to sell a home. GOBankingRates first found the 2022 average median list price and 2022 average median sale price for homes in each metropolitan area by averaging Zillow's monthly estimates of each figure for January through August 2022. Then, GOBankingRates calculated the (1) typical difference between the list and sale price for homes in each area in 2022. GOBankingRates then similarly analyzed Zillow's monthly estimates of other housing market metrics to find each metro area's (2) average housing market inventory in 2022, (3) 2022 average median number of days homes spent on the market, (4) 2022 average share of listings that took a price cut while on the market, and (5) 2022 average median price cut taken by homes on the market, measured as a percent of the prior list price. All cities were then scored against each other and ranked, with a larger difference between list and sale prices, larger housing market inventory, greater typical number of days spent on the market, greater share of listings taking a price cut, and larger price cuts taken indictaing places where it is more difficult to sell a home. Zillow's smoothed estimates for single family residences were used for all metrics. In the calculation of final scores, factor (2) was weighted half as heavily as all other factors. All data was compiled on and up to date as of September 27, 2022.","May 17, 2023 at 7:30 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/25-hardest-places-sell-home-210002437.html,GOBankingRates,0.0,0.0,0.04433170995670997,0.42264880952380957,2023-05-17 07:30:00,2023-05-17 07:30:00,44.290000915527344,44.810001373291016,-0.5200004577636719
ZG,"Is Now The Time To Look At Buying Zillow Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZG)?"," View our latest analysis for Zillow Group According to my valuation model, the stock is currently overvalued by about 31%, trading at US$44.77 compared to my intrinsic value of $34.21. This means that the buying opportunity has probably disappeared for now. If you like the stock, you may want to keep an eye out for a potential price decline in the future. Given that Zillow Group’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by 76% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Zillow Group. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.","May 16, 2023 at 4:14 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/now-time-look-buying-zillow-111422793.html,Simply Wall St.,0.0,0.0,0.23737499999999997,0.48887500000000006,2023-05-16 04:14:00,2023-05-16 04:14:00,44.790000915527344,44.18000030517578,0.6100006103515625

There are plenty of underrated and charming towns that homebuyers might be missing out on. Some could be a financial stretch, but others are below May's average U.S. home value of $339,048, as reported by Zillow.To find these ""hidden gems"" in every state, GOBankingRates analyzed cities with a population between 10,000 and 75,000, according to data sourced from AreaVibes and have information on the average 2023 single-family home value in their area available from Zillow. If there were too few cities within the state that met this criterion, the population requirement was relaxed to include cities with a population of over 5,000. States for which the population requirement was relaxed: Alaska and Vermont. The study also looked at the median list price of homes within the area.

ZG,Housing market could tumble into a deep freeze if US defaults on its debt,"WHAT IS THE DEBT CEILING, AND WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR YOU?""Much uncertainty surrounds these estimates, but there’s little doubt that a default would be a major negative shock to housing market activity,"" Tucker wrote in the report (titled ""A debt ceiling default would send the US housing market back into a deep freeze"").READ ON THE FOX BUSINESS APPThe Zillow analysis comes amid a prolonged standoff over the debt limit. Republicans, who control the House, passed a bill that raises the borrowing limit, and also includes budget cuts. In turn, President Biden and his fellow Democrats, who control the Senate, have insisted on a ""clean"" debt ceiling bill and will negotiate any spending cuts separately.DEBT CEILING SHOWDOWN RISKS TRIGGERING ‘SELF-INFLICTED’ RECESSION""I really think there’s a desire on their part, as well as ours, to reach an agreement, and I think we’ll be able to do it,"" Biden told reporters Sunday in Delaware.However, McCarthy cast doubt on that statement Monday morning. He told NBC News during an interview the two sides are still ""far apart."" ""It doesn’t seem to me yet that they want a deal,"" he said.Biden, McCarthy and the other congressional leaders will meet again Tuesday.If the U.S. failed to raise or suspend the debt limit, it would eventually have to temporarily default on some of its obligations, which could have serious negative economic implications. Interest rates would likely spike, and demand for Treasuries would drop; even the threat of default can cause borrowing costs to increase, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.","May 15, 2023 at 11:31 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/housing-market-could-tumble-deep-183135234.html,Fox Business,0.0,0.4,-0.012731481481481474,0.48356481481481495,2023-05-15 11:31:00,2023-05-15 11:31:00,44.25,44.77000045776367,-0.5200004577636719
ZG,25 Best Places in the US To Live on a Fixed Income,"Living on a fixed income basically means you're solely or almost entirely dependent on funds such as Social Security, pensions and inheritance, with little to no flexibility in the amount you're paid each month. Unstable costs, such as a volatile housing market, can be especially challenging to deal with on a fixed income.Nestled along the Hudson River, Troy saw housing prices rise 7.16% from January 2022 to January 2023. Rent prices grew about the same to a median of $1,329 per month. But by New York standards. Troy is fairly affordable for those on a fixed income. The median home value of $235, 955 fell well below the national average of $328,111, and prices are slowing down, rising only 0.07% in the interval from October 2022 to January 2023.Coraopolis is a western suburb of Pittsburgh, near the airport if you expect visits from out-of-state relatives and friends. Rent prices increased 3.46% year over year, but at $1,398, they're still well below the national average of $1,970. Median home prices went up 5.41% in  the past year but less than 1% over the past quarter to $270,816.Pictured: Pittsburgh, PennsylvaniaIf you're thinking of renting instead of buying a home, consider Marion, a suburb of Cedar Rapids. The median rent of $809 is the lowest of the 25 cities in the GOBankingRates study, although it did rise 6.78% over the past year. That's almost identical to the increase in home prices, which rose to $253,157 in the past year but went up only about $300 in the past quarter.Pictured: Cedar Rapids, IowaRent prices in Saint Cloud went up by 9.20% over the past year, one of the highest increases in the study. However, the price grew to $1,219, which still is more than $700 a month less than the national average. The median home value went up just 0.01% over the last quarter to $224,822 in Saint Cloud, which is a little more than an hour northwest of the Twin Cities.Wauwatosa sits on the shores of Lake Michigan, about 100 miles north of Chicago. It's other distinction? With a median home value of $322,992, Wauwatosa is the most expensive place to buy a home in the GOBankingRates study. But the prices didn't skyrocket over the past year, going up 5.96%. Rents didn't go up quite as much, rising just over 5% a median of $1,538 per month. While it's one of the higher rental prices in the study, it's still $400 less than the national average.Pictured: Milwaukee, WisconsinIn the Oklahoma City suburb of Yukon, housing prices skyrocketed in the first three quarters of 2022, then barely moved a trickle in the final quarter. Median home values went up 10.03% from January 2022 to January 2023, making it the highest jump in the study, with the price settling at $242,829. Maybe the rush to buy accounted for an increase in rental costs of less than 2% to $1,507.Pictured: Oklahoma City, OklahomaIowa City is the second Iowa locale on the list, but it's costlier than its suburb of Marion. The median home price in Iowa City is just under $300,000, making it the fourth most expensive place to buy a house in the study. The value went up 5.27% year over year, a half-percentage point higher than the increase in rent. A rental in Iowa City is $1,218 per month, well under the national average.Real estate prices in Wheeling, which is about 30 miles northwest of Chicago, increased just 3.25% year over year to $268,919. Rent prices had more than triple of an increase, however, going up 10.99% to $1,766 per month - one of the two highest rents in the study.Pictured: Buffalo Grove, IllinoisStillwater's median home value of $216,714 put in the bottom third of prices in the study.

With all these data points sourced GOBankingRates then pared the list to only include cities that met the following criteria: a home value of less than the national average of $328,111 and also a ranking as one of the 5,000 largest housing markets, according to ZillowFor these qualified cities, GOBankingRates found: (1) the quarter-over-quarter percent change in home value; (2) the year-over-year percent change in home value; and (3) the year-over-year percent change in rent. Those cities with negative values for factors (1) or (2) were then eliminated. With the remaining cities, GOBankingRates scored and combined all three factors with the lowest score being best. These factors were chosen because changes in home values serve as a proxy for measuring the volatility of a housing market, with large increases posing a threat to those living on fixed incomes, while a negative change in value means money is being lost in depreciating house values. However, decreasing rental prices benefit a household on a fixed income.All data was collected on and up to date as of March 1, 2023.Photo Disclaimer: Please note photos are for representational purposes only and may represent the nearest large metropolitan area. ","May 15, 2023 at 7:15 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/best-places-every-state-live-143100947.html,GOBankingRates,0.4121212121212121,0.3333333333333333,0.060317998750834566,0.39364029419999585,2023-05-15 07:15:00,2023-05-15 07:15:00,44.25,44.77000045776367,-0.5200004577636719

ZG,"Home buyers need to 'be prepared to move quickly' amid supply, mortgage rate constraints: Economist","Zillow Senior Economist Jeff Tucker joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss how debt default will impact the housing market, mortgage rates, pricing in the housing market, and housing inventory.Excuse me, Jeff Tucker. Sorry about that, Jeff. Break this down for us. When we talk about the impact that a debt default is going to have on the housing market, mortgage rates are going to jump by how much?What that means for consumers and homebuyers is borrowing costs are likely to rise really substantially.But just because it's unlikely doesn't mean it's impossible. And so one of the reasons we did this research was just to highlight what a serious issue it is and why it is so important to come to a resolution on the debt ceiling and hopefully never find out exactly what does happen if we crash through it and default on the debt.Buyers kind of went missing in action in last fall and last winter. There was a lot of concern that home prices might even decline this year. And instead, a lot of buyers have kind of come back to the market. They're out there shopping for homes.Yes, it's a lower level of activity, fewer homes are trading hands. But a big part of the reason for that is when those home shoppers have returned to the market, they're not finding as many listings as they would have hoped for or as we would expect in really any previous spring selling season. There just aren't that many new listings hitting Zillow every week as we would expect or as homebuyers would like to see. So the ones that do come to the market are getting a surprising amount of competition and actually seeing the prices get bid up again.But compared to any time pre-pandemic, that still qualifies as a very fast moving market. So I think that underscores for buyers that it's not too hot to handle like it may have felt last year or the year before, but you need to be prepared to move quickly in a market like this. If you see a home that you like, you need to be preapproved, you need to be working with an agent so you can be one of those folks who makes an offer on it within the first weekend or by that offer review date on Monday or Tuesday.So there's a lot of scenarios where people could be coming off the sidelines. I think as folks hear the news that homes are selling quickly and prices haven't actually particularly fallen, that could draw some more sellers out. And then probably the elephant in the room here is new construction. So home builders have absolutely heard this news, that there's not much existing home inventory to compete with them.So they are kind of filling the void. They are continuing to crank through and complete the homes that they started building last fall, last year as they suddenly see buyers lining up to buy them again.","May 12, 2023 at 1:59 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/home-buyers-prepared-move-quickly-205948801.html,Yahoo Finance Video,0.3333333333333333,0.5,0.10756433381433379,0.45354316979316966,2023-05-12 13:59:00,2023-05-12 13:59:00,44.5099983215332,44.13999938964844,0.3699989318847656
ZG,"Mortgage Payments Could Surge 22% if US Defaults on Debt, New Zillow Report Shows","A mortgage rate of 8.4% would represent a spike of about one-third from current levels. As of May 11, the average mortgage rate on 30-year fixed-rate loans was 6.35%, according to Freddie Mac. The four-week average was 6.39%.“Home buyers and sellers finally have been adjusting to mortgage rates over 6% this spring, but a debt default could potentially raise borrowing costs even higher and send the market into a deep freeze,” Zillow senior economist Jeff Tucker said in a press release “Home values might not see a notable drop, but higher mortgage rates would severely impair affordability, for first-time buyers especially. It is critically important to find a solution and not put more strain on Americans who are striving to achieve their homeownership dreams.”Zillow did point out that the U.S. “has never before” defaulted on its debt and is “very unlikely” to do so now. But as GOBankingRates reported, there doesn’t appear to be much common ground in current debt ceiling negotiations as June 1 approaches – even after a meeting this week between President Joe Biden and U.S. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy.A default would “almost certainly mean severe disruption for the economy,” according to Zillow, with ripple effects that would take a major toll on the U.S. housing market. Interest rates (and mortgage rates) would likely spike due to lower confidence in Treasury bills being repaid, which means investors would require a bigger return before buying them.In this scenario, Zillow projects that mortgage rates would peak at 8.4% in September. This in turn would “freeze sales in an already chilled market” hampered by a lack of affordable homes for many potential buyers.“If the affordability mountain grows even taller, fewer would-be buyers will be able to purchase a home,” the Zillow report said.In addition, homeowners who in recent years locked in historically low rates of around 3% would be unlikely to sell their homes and re-enter the market if rates move above 8%.Zillow estimates that such an environment would “wipe nearly one-quarter of expected sales” off the board in coming months. The biggest impact would likely come in September, with an estimated 23% fewer existing home sales. The one bright spot is that home values probably wouldn’t take much of a hit.More From GOBankingRatesHouses in These Cities Are Suddenly BargainsGet Top Travel Tips To Help You Save More3 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000What's Your Favorite Local Small Business?

ZG,"Zillow: U.S. default would see mortgage rates top 8%, home sales plummet, and the housing market slip back into a deep freeze","Zillow's economist does acknowledge that a U.S. default is ""unlikely.""Let’s take a look at the difference between monthly mortgage payments at 6% versus 8%. On a $600,000 home, after putting 20% down, the monthly payment at 6% would be roughly $2,878 (without taxes and insurance.) With the exact same circumstances but at 8%, the monthly payment would be $3,522. That’s a $644 monthly difference. That would price a lot of buyers out of the market, and keep those who have been sidelined since rates went up last year on the outskirts.“When we forecast the evolution of the housing market over the next 18 months in the event of such a debt default, we estimate that existing home sales would fall as much as 23% relative to the no-default baseline forecast later this year, and that home values may be 5% lower at the end of 2024 than expected in the no-default scenario,” Zillow says.According to Zillow, if mortgage rates top 8%, existing home sales would drop 23% from 4.3 million in April to 3.3 million in September.“Any major disruption to the economy and debt markets will have major repercussions for the housing market, chilling sales and raising borrowing costs, just when the market was beginning to stabilize and recover from the major cooldown of late 2022,” Zillow says.","May 11, 2023 at 11:16 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zillow-u-default-see-mortgage-181606369.html,Fortune,0.16666666666666666,0.3,-0.02878086419753086,0.346141975308642,2023-05-11 11:16:00,2023-05-11 11:16:00,46.47999954223633,45.02000045776367,1.4599990844726562
ZG,Soft Inflation Report Sets Stage for a Summer Stock Surge,"Today, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics released its April Consumer Price Index report, which is the most widely followed inflation report. It showed that the headline inflation rate in the U.S. dropped again in April to 4.9%, below expectations for a reading of 5%. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsInflation has now dropped for 10 consecutive months, matching the longest losing streak for inflation in the past 100 years!You read that right. While it may still feel like prices are high, the data says we are in the midst of the most powerful disinflation streak of the past century. Inflation is very clearly on track to revert back to its long-term averages within a few months. As inflation falls, stocks are rising – especially inflation-sensitive tech stocks. Bank lending standards have proven to be a very reliable leading indicator of inflation trends over the past 25 years. During that time, these standards have been about six months ahead of inflation rates.And when banks dramatically tighten lending conditions, inflation tends to collapse over the next six months. When banks loosen lending conditions, inflation tends to soar over the next six months. Ever since Silicon Valley Bank failed in early March, banks across the U.S. have dramatically tightened their lending standards. The pace and magnitude of tightening we’ve seen in April and May has only been matched twice this century – during COVID and the 2008 financial crisis. This record-level tightening in bank lending standards strongly suggests that inflation will keep crashing in the coming months. At the same time, the biggest component of inflation – shelter – is finally starting to roll over. Leading indicators suggest it will come crashing down over the next 12 months. Shelter CPI rose 8.1% in April, down from 8.2% in March. Sure, that is the tiniest of drops. But it is a drop nonetheless, and it is significant because it is the first drop that shelter CPI has registered in this economic cycle. Data suggests this is just the first of many shelter CPI drops over the next year. That is, when Zillow’s Observed Rent Price Index moves higher, shelter CPI tends to move higher over the next 12 months, and vice versa. Zillow’s Observed Rent Price Index peaked about 12 months ago at 17% growth. Since then, it has collapsed to 6%. Shelter is the biggest weighting in CPI. If it collapses over the next 12 months, headline CPI will assuredly crash, too. On the whole, the bulk of evidence strongly suggests that inflation will keep crashing – and perhaps even at an accelerated pace – over the next few months. As inflation has crashed over the past few months, stocks have soared, particularly tech stocks. And as it keeps crashing over the next few months, stocks will keep soaring, particularly tech stocks. We think being bullish on tech stocks today will pay off in spades over the next few months. Get ahead of the curve and find out which tech stocks we’re buying today ahead of a summer surge.On the date of publication, Luke Lango did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.","May 10, 2023 at 12:33 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/soft-inflation-report-sets-stage-193318132.html,InvestorPlace,0.1,0.35,0.07724712107065049,0.33707282913165265,2023-05-10 12:33:00,2023-05-10 12:33:00,47.41999816894531,46.52000045776367,0.8999977111816406
ZG,Home-buying costs could soar 22% if US defaults on its debt,"A debt default is very unlikely, but new scenario projections from Zillow show sales would decrease sharply as mortgage costs balloonMortgage rates could reach 8.4% in the unlikely event of a debt default, sending the mortgage payment on a typical home 22% higher by September.Home values would not lose much ground, according to Zillow's analysis, but a sharp rise in mortgage rates would do further damage to housing affordability.Home sales activity might fall by nearly one-quarter from current projections at its lowest point, in September.To be sure, the U.S. has never before defaulted on its debt, and it is very unlikely that the U.S. will fail to pay its debts now. This analysis projects what might happen in the unlikely worst-case scenario of a prolonged default, and it is not a prediction that a default will occur.A debt default would almost certainly mean severe disruption for the economy, with the ripple effects taking their toll on the housing market. One highly likely consequence would be rising interest rates — including mortgage rates — as shaken confidence in Treasury bills being repaid means investors would require a greater return before purchasing them. Mortgage rates tend to follow Treasury rates and would be expected to rise as a result.Zillow projects this combined impact of buyers and sellers pulling back would wipe nearly one-quarter of expected sales off the board in some months.

Newly pending sales rose 2% from March — a smaller monthly increase than historical norms.United States$339,3661.0 %2 %-1 %-28 %3 %10New York, NY$579,5980.9 %-7 %-5 %-33 %-17 %22Los Angeles, CA$869,8701.1 %-3 %-4 %-38 %-13 %13Chicago, IL$295,5121.5 %0 %1 %-32 %-18 %6Dallas, TX$371,4020.8 %9 %9 %-13 %33 %9Houston, TX$301,9590.5 %-2 %-6 %-24 %17 %14Washington, DC$539,8361.2 %7 %-4 %-39 %-25 %5Philadelphia, PA$334,0221.3 %1 %-2 %-33 %-15 %7Miami, FL$456,9721.1 %-14 %-13 %-23 %31 %25Atlanta, GA$365,9880.8 %-8 %-10 %-35 %-2 %11Boston, MA$630,6751.4 %10 %-7 %-32 %-15 %7Phoenix, AZ$434,3510.3 %-2 %-6 %-38 %15 %27San Francisco, CA$1,114,0901.3 %0 %4 %-40 %-23 %12Riverside, CA$545,3920.5 %1 %-1 %-42 %-4 %16Detroit, MI$237,8451.7 %10 %10 %-28 %-7 %6Seattle, WA$688,3301.2 %3 %-9 %-47 %-24 %6Minneapolis, MN$365,8841.4 %6 %6 %-37 %-21 %11San Diego, CA$852,5351.3 %-5 %-5 %-44 %-23 %8Tampa, FL$367,4050.7 %-5 %-4 %-24 %32 %13Denver, CO$585,8901.2 %9 %-5 %-32 %1 %6Baltimore, MD$362,8911.5 %7 %-1 %-35 %-19 %5St. Louis, MO$235,3771.6 %10 %1 %-21 %-5 %5Orlando, FL$382,4410.7 %-4 %-5 %-26 %18 %12Charlotte, NC$364,7040.8 %2 %-11 %-36 %16 %8San Antonio, TX$292,1700.5 %-5 %-2 %-20 %43 %17Portland, OR$543,7831.3 %8 %7 %-37 %-13 %7Sacramento, CA$555,5160.8 %6 %15 %-40 %-21 %8Pittsburgh, PA$198,2411.2 %10 %1 %-19 %-1 %7Cincinnati, OH$265,1491.6 %9 %-1 %-30 %-15 %3Austin, TX$481,1000.6 %4 %-4 %-18 %47 %31Las Vegas, NV$396,5180.3 %-3 %0 %-41 %12 %19Kansas City, MO$291,6451.9 %16 %2 %-28 %-9 %3Columbus, OH$299,1461.7 %14 %10 %-27 %-10 %3Indianapolis, IN$268,7991.3 %-1 %0 %-24 %0 %5Cleveland, OH$211,6721.6 %4 %-2 %-29 %-8 %5San Jose, CA$1,427,2071.5 %11 %-2 %-45 %-31 %15Nashville, TN$427,6620.7 %9 %1 %-21 %35 %11Virginia Beach, VA$327,5411.0 %-5 %-4 %-34 %-16 %16Providence, RI$436,0701.0 %10 %5 %-32 %-18 %7Jacksonville, FL$355,9460.5 %-7 %-9 %-29 %37 %30Milwaukee, WI$310,6631.6 %0 %13 %-31 %-27 %6Oklahoma City, OK$226,3381.5 %2 %0 %-16 %23 %7Raleigh, NC$423,6570.6 %0 %-8 %-30 %5 %6Memphis, TN$230,3490.6 %0 %-3 %-17 %18 %20Richmond, VA$347,4211.3 %13 %5 %-26 %-16 %5Louisville, KY$246,9201.3 %49 %1 %-29 %-2 %6New Orleans, LA$234,608-0.1 %-8 %-7 %-20 %35 %21Salt Lake City, UT$537,9151.1 %1 %6 %-36 %4 %8Hartford, CT$322,7621.2 %23 %9 %-36 %-30 %5Buffalo, NY$243,4491.7 %-1 %6 %-22 %-10 %9Birmingham, AL$242,5370.8 %4 %4 %-23 %7 %8*Table ordered by market size SOURCE Zillow","May 10, 2023 at 5:00 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/market-firmly-sellers-favor-rising-120000037.html,PR Newswire,-0.1,0.35,0.10135566188197767,0.3121212121212121,2023-05-10 05:00:00,2023-05-10 05:00:00,47.41999816894531,46.52000045776367,0.8999977111816406
ZG,These Are the 20 Most Underpriced Housing Markets in the U.S.,"If your goal as a seller is to get as much value out of your home as possible, listing your house in a buyer's market is not ideal.

ZG,8 Famous Companies That Arent Profitable,"What's keeping them in business is their potential for growth and investors who believe that future gains later are better than money in hand now. They're sacrificing profits today, the bulls believe, to invest for success down the road.The bears, on the other hand, would just feel better if they saw some black ink.Everyone can be an at-home chef thanks to Blue Apron, the grocery delivery and recipe service established in 2012. The company went public in 2017 with a valuation of $1.9 billion -- but it was an up-and-down ride until the pandemic sent demand for in-home cooking subscriptions soaring. A COVID-19-inspired mega-bump in subscriptions allowed Blue Apron to briefly introduce itself to profitability, according to the Wall Street Journal, but the greeting was brief.Blue Apron always had high marketing costs, always struggled to attract new customers, and always had trouble retaining the customers it already had. In addition, Blue Apron had to deal with an increasingly competitive market space as more and more meal-delivery services sprang up in the late 2010s -- HelloFresh and Sunbasket are hot on Blue Apron's tail. According to Coresight Research, meal-kit companies enjoyed growth of 70% in 2020. But that rate slowed as restaurants returned to peak capacity, down to 20% in 2022, according to The Business Research Company. If Blue Apron couldn't cling to a fleeting profit during the best of times, the future is uncertain.Direct-to-consumer mattress brand Casper was established in 2013 and quickly attracted big-name investors like Leonardo DiCaprio, Ashton Kutcher and 50 Cent. The company went public on Feb. 5, 2020, with a valuation of $476 million, according to Crunchbase. Casper stated in its filing that it wouldn't be profitable any time soon, Forbes reported. But a few months later in August, the Wall Street Journal reported that Casper had announced that it expected to turn a profit in mid-2021.Mid-2021 came and went, and Casper failed to keep its promise. On Aug. 10, shareholders punished the stock with a bruising selloff of more than 14% when the company announced it would now not turn a profit until 2022. The company has yet to disclose its net loss for the full year 2022. Like so many other businesses in so many other segments of the economy, Casper had fallen victim to supply chain woes, labor inflation and the rising cost of raw materials, according to Seeking Alpha.Ride-sharing app Lyft was founded in 2012 and became a publicly traded company in March 2019. With a valuation of $24 billion at its IPO, stocks opened at $72 a share. The stock value has dropped significantly since then, with the current value hovering around $10.The last time Lyft's operations generated positive cash flow was the third quarter of 2019, according to TechCrunch. But when using the EBITDA format -- a stricter way of calculating profitability that's preferred by tech startups -- Lyft was in the black the last three quarters in a row. And anyway, the company is sitting on $2 billion in growth-supporting cash.Peloton went public in 2019, seven years after its founding. It was valued at $8.1 billion at the time of its IPO.Although Peloton's CEO John Foley repeatedly stated that his fitness company was profitable, the numbers revealed in its IPO filing tell a different story -- and it remained that way until the pandemic.When gyms across the country closed, Peleton became an early and obvious winner in the pandemic. In September 2020, the Wall Street Journal reported that the company had just posted its first-ever quarterly profit -- but management wouldn't make a habit of it. Just one month later in November, according to Seeking Alpha, the company announced it was continuing its march toward 100%-plus growth into 2021, which could 0nly come at the expense of profits. Indeed, the downward trend has continued. Peloton had a total net loss of $2.83 billion in 2022, according to Business of Apps.Pinterest fell from its high of around $90 per share earlier in 2021 to its current $20ish -- but it might soon actually turn a profit. In June 2021, Yahoo reported that the company was essentially operating at break-even. Its analysts speculated that Pinterest was nearing the point where Facebook was when it first began amassing profits and that Pinterest would likely start doing the same thing soon itself. But at the close of Q4 2022, Pinterest reported net losses of $96 million.When Snap Inc. went public in 2017, it was valued at $24 billion -- the biggest initial public offering in years, the Financial Times reported. However, years later, the company is still not profitable. In April 2019, a Financial Times analysis calculated that the company would run out of funds in three years if that didn't change.Like so many other companies on this list, Snap had long prioritized growth over profitability, according to Crunchbase. Today, it's experiencing strong revenue growth that is impressing both investors and Wall Street alike, according to Investor's Business Daily.  That, however, is no guarantee. At the end of 2020, Nasdaq reported that Snap still wasn't profitable three years after its IPO and was still three years away from breaking even. But in 2022, even though revenue continued to grow, Snap reported a loss of $1.4 billion.WeWork co-founder Adam Neumann set out to change the way people work by establishing collaborative co-working spaces catering to younger workers. He also had plans to expand the brand to residential and educational spaces, too. Then, the company's failed IPO filing in August 2019 threw a wrench in the gears -- but the worst was yet to come.By July 2019, WeWork was losing $219,000 every hour, the Financial Times reported. The company's disastrous attempt to go public resulted in a management shakeup -- and then the pandemic came. The virus closed offices around the world, suffocating the company's shared-workspace business model. WeWork lost 30% of its customers, according to The Guardian, as revenues were cut in half and losses topped $2.1 billion. Even so, at the start of 2021, the company's CEO announced that WeWork was on track to be profitable by the end of the year. But losses have continued to mount. The company ended 2021 with $4.6 billion in losses, and 2022 with $2.3 billion in losses.Zillow was founded in 2005 and went public in 2011. At the time of its IPO, Zillow's valuation was $540 million with an initial share price of $20, according to Crunchbase. Now, shares are worth around $40.In February 2020, Zillow announced it was moving away from its core business and moving toward a new model of buying houses directly from sellers and flipping them to new buyers. That kind of ambition requires a profit-gobbling level of investment, particularly considering that the first thing the new project did was lose millions of dollars, according to CNN Business.One year later in February 2021, however, Zillow posted not just a profit, but its highest profit ever thanks to demand from a red-hot housing market. But in August, Barron's reported that Zillow's commitment to investing in the business was still hampering profits on the year. In 2022, they reported a net loss of $72 million.More From GOBankingRates5 Expensive Renovations Homeowners Always RegretFinancial Insight in Your Inbox: Sign Up for GBR's Daily Newsletter3 Ways to Recession Proof Your Retirement7 Things You Must Do To Create a Plan for Your Money","May 8, 2023 at 5:00 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/8-famous-companies-aren-t-120001206.html,GOBankingRates,0.5,1.0,0.04504019484788716,0.3062463391309545,2023-05-08 05:00:00,2023-05-08 05:00:00,47.5,47.380001068115234,0.11999893188476562
ZG,"A heartbreaking truth for single Americans: US renters pay a singles tax of up to $19,500 heres how to feel financially secure even when you're on you...","Living alone has its perks. You get to watch what you want on TV, there are no timetable tussles for the shower, and no one steals your leftovers from the fridge.But flying solo comes at a cost.According to a Forbes survey, 93% of U.S. singles feel the burden of the “singles tax” and 1 in 3 respondents admitted to staying in a relationship longer for the financial benefits.Nationwide, singles pay nearly $7,000 extra per year to live alone in a one-bedroom apartment — but don’t despair, there are ways to turn use that independence to your financial advantage.The size of the so-called ""singles tax"" — how much more you pay per year compared to a couple living in the same apartment — varies widely depending on your local real estate market.Other cities sucking the savings out of single Americans include San Francisco, with a $14,000 singles tax for a one-bedroom apartment, San Jose ($12,401), San Diego ($11,774) and Boston ($11,546).Zillow found that, compared to renters living solo, couples save an average of $14,000 by cohabitating. In the most expensive areas, like New York City and San Francisco, couples can save up to $39,000 or $28,227, respectively.In January, renters in apartments and single-family homes paid 8.6% more than they would have 12-months ago, according to the National Association of Realtors (NAR). The monthly rent change was 0.7% or 8.8% on an annualized basis.But some believe rent relief is on the way.However, Zillow’s home trends expert Amanda Pendleton urged renters to be cautious.“Even though rent prices are starting to cool, they are still significantly higher than they were a year ago,” she said. “Renters considering going solo this year must decide how valuable living alone is to them, and if the cost is worth it.”If you do opt for the single lifestyle, here are some steps you can take to shore up your financial security.If you're carrying a balance, paying down debt should be a top priority.Keeping an emergency fund with about three month's worth of money — including all expenses like rent, bills, groceries, loan payments, car expenses and so on — is important to becoming financially secure.This article provides information only and should not be construed as advice.

ZG,Hate Your New House? Heres How To Sell It Quickly and Easily,"So, what can you do if you hate your new house and want to sell it quickly?First, Zillow recommends cleaning and decluttering, especially if you’re short on time to sell.Staging the house is also crucial. According to Zillow, 48% of recent buyers said having the home staged is “extremely, very or somewhat important to their home-buying decision.”In addition, Zillow notes that 22% of sellers who make improvements to the home sell above list price, compared with 16% of sellers who don’t.In terms of improvements you might undertake, painting the home’s interior is the most common update sellers engage in (36% of those polled said so), followed by landscaping the yard (29%), replacing or repairing carpeting or flooring (26%) and making improvements to the bathroom (26%).The most common options are selling “for sale by owner” (FSBO) or with a real estate agent. Zillow points out that in bypassing an agent, you will save on the commission. However, hiring an agent will likely save you some headaches and will streamline the process — which in the end might result in a faster sale.Another strategy is to sell to an investor, which could also save you time as “you can expect a quicker close, an as-is sale and an all-cash offer,” Zillow notes. However, beware of scams and make sure you conduct proper research before considering this avenue.You could also sell to a so-called iBuyer (instant buyer), which is a company that uses technology to make an offer on your home instantly, according to Opendoor.Realtor.com explains that, usually, you will receive a cash offer within 24 hours on your home when selling to an iBuyer. There are downsides, however, namely that you might make less money on the sale.If you’re in a hurry to sell your house, Zillow recommends you set a timeline to lower your price if you don’t receive any offers.“The longer your home is on the market, the lower your odds are of selling it for listing price,” Zillow notes.Alternatively, offer to sweeten the deal with additional repairs or included appliances.Interestingly, Zillow says that homes listed on a Thursday sell faster and are more likely to sell above list price than those listed on any other day of the week. On the other hand, Sunday is the worst day to list for a quick sale, as homes listed on that day tend to stay on the market for 8 days longer than homes listed on Thursdays.March is statistically the best month to list a property if you want to sell quickly, while July is the best month to list a property if you want to maximize profit.Zillow says it recommends listing your home for sale in March (or during the summer), but no later than Labor Day.More From GOBankingRatesHouses in These Cities Are Suddenly BargainsGet Top Travel Tips To Help You Save More3 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000Have a Favorite Small Business?

I think the -- probably, Jeremy, you're best positioned to address the higher conversion mid-funnel question, and then we'll talk about the second part. Yes.Jeremy WacksmanRichard N. BartonJeremy WacksmanOperatorOur next question is from Brad Erickson with RBC.Bradley D. EricksonSo maybe 1 or 2 more on tours. Just based on all the positive indicators going on already mentioned, how would we see tours in this case start to translate to revenue in terms of, I guess, agents finding more value and conversion from those leads and then obviously wanting to pay more? Because I guess with the 3x conversion comment you've always given, that kind of implies that agents already pay more for those leads or would. Maybe that's right or not. But if you could just talk about the mechanics and the -- kind of the process of getting paid more on that higher conversion and sort of how you see that evolving, with real-time touring in particular.Jeremy WacksmanBradley D. EricksonGot it. Maybe just one follow-up related to that then. Are you saying then that you're also -- I recognize the real-time touring, rolling it out in 4 markets, et cetera, and going presumably nationwide over time. But are you also seeing a mix of touring leads within the broader business? Is that what you're saying? Or am I not understanding that right?Jeremy WacksmanOperatorThe next question is from the line of Vincent Kardos with Jefferies.Vincent Nugent KardosThis is Vincent on for John Colantuoni at Jefferies. I have a follow-up on real-time touring as well. Is there any color you're able to provide on the impact specifically from real-time touring in your test markets that you're seeing on the cost per transaction, the rate at which Premier Agents introduce clients to Zillow Home Loan officers or the ultimate mortgage attachment rate to buyers?Jeremy WacksmanVincent Nugent KardosGot it. Got it. And then one more quick one on the financing side of the business as well as these Premier Agents, is there anything you're able to tell us at this point about kind of what you've seen as mortgage rates have started to stabilize a little bit in kind of the 6.3% to 6.4% range over the past month or 2 here?Richard N. BartonAre you seeing -- Brad, maybe? Are you seeing anything? I mean my commentary on the macro has it kind of more of the same. Brad, are you seeing anything -- how have our e-com forecasts for, say, transactions for the year changed recently? Not much, right?Bradley Allen BerningYes, not much. I think you saw out of the March quarter, we were talking about around $4.4 million, $4.5 million. For the full year, I think we're looking at like $4.3 million now. So there's been some modest changes, but relatively modest as we bounce around at these levels.Richard N. BartonWhich are low. I mean they're low levels. We've said for a couple of quarters now that we think over the next 10 years, there are going to be 60 million home transactions. And our eyes are focused on that. We're investing for that, and we want to have a meaningful and increasing percentage of those transactions happen in our sphere, so that we can monetize it and we can deliver value via the super app and many other means. So...OperatorThe next question is from Tom White with D.A. Davidson.Thomas Cauthorn WhiteRichard N. BartonWell, maybe, Jeremy, maybe you start and then Allen finish?Jeremy WacksmanRichard N. BartonDo you want to hit the marketing, too? Or Allen, do you want to hit that?Allen W. ParkerI'm happy to. Or Jeremy will hook you up.Jeremy WacksmanYes, Allen.Allen W. ParkerJeremy WacksmanYes. No, I think that's right.OperatorOur next question is from Jay McCanless with Wedbush.Jay McCanlessSorry to press on this topic, but I don't -- still not understanding. When you talk about the better-than-expected number of connections, that -- those connections weren't from a specific app or a specific process that you have there but it's more you fix the pipeline of how those leads got to the agents. And I guess the kind of the second part of that question is, if that pipeline wasn't working before, do you feel like you may have lost some business that now you'll be gaining and helping you to grow ahead of the market?Richard N. BartonJeremy, it sounds like you have a reasonable -- I mean...Jeremy WacksmanYes. I mean I guess, I think, Rich, you talked about it earlier as fixing our leaky funnel, right? It's really just...Richard N. BartonI don't like to talk about it as a leaky funnel anymore. That implies we're broke. We're like smoothing. We're getting better at converting the leads that are already in our funnel into transactions anyways.Jeremy WacksmanRichard N. BartonJay McCanlessUnderstood. All right. And then the second question I had -- and kudos on the growth in new construction. And I was wondering, you said when you were given the guidance about resi being down 10% in the midpoint, probably doing better than the overall market. Is that just Zillow's residential revenue versus existing homes? Or is there a forecast around new housing growth built in there? And if so, maybe could you talk about what you're thinking the growth rates for those 2 different types of housing would be.Bradley Allen BerningWant me to start on that, Rich?Richard N. BartonYes, yes. Sure, Brad.Bradley Allen BerningSo the existing home sale forecast that we talked about is -- we're talking about down 18% to down 28% in total transaction dollar volumes for Q2, and so our residential outperformance we talked about is versus that existing home market. That does not include, obviously, the new home market. The new home market is a smaller part of our overall business. So the part that more closely correlates with our business is the existing home sales, so that's why you see us reference that and correlate. And as we called out, the things that are driving the benefits that we see in Q1, we expect to continue into Q2.OperatorThis completes the allotted time for questions. I will now turn the call back over to Rich Barton for any closing remarks.Richard N. BartonWell, great chatting with everybody. Thanks for taking the time on this busy earnings day. You can see we feel really good about a bunch of incremental improvements adding up to good relative results, good results relative to the industry. We look forward to chatting with you soon. Thanks a lot.OperatorThis concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.","May 4, 2023 at 6:49 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/q1-2023-zillow-group-inc-134938929.html,Thomson Reuters StreetEvents,0.0,0.0,0.20938091035178413,0.4506638857367013,2023-05-04 06:49:00,2023-05-04 06:49:00,42.400001525878906,45.880001068115234,-3.479999542236328
ZG,Zillow Group (ZG) Q1 Earnings and Revenues Beat Estimates,"Zillow Group (ZG) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.35 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.15 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.49 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 133.33%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this online real estate marketplace would post earnings of $0.10 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.21, delivering a surprise of 110%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.Zillow , which belongs to the Zacks Internet - Services industry, posted revenues of $469 million for the quarter ended March 2023, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 11.31%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $4.26 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Zillow shares have added about 35% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 7.3%.What's Next for Zillow?While Zillow has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Zillow: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.24 on $457.1 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $1.15 on $1.83 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Internet - Services is currently in the top 47% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Another stock from the same industry, Bridgeline Digital, Inc. (BLIN), has yet to report results for the quarter ended March 2023.This company is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.04 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -233.3%.

That was better than what the Street was looking for. Also, active sellers, active buyers also coming in above expectations.Year to date, looking at losses of just about 17%. We heard from an analyst earlier in the program saying that some of the slowdown here that we could potentially see as consumers pull back their spending, that some of that may be priced in when you're looking at those losses since the start of the year.Moving on to Costco, Costco releasing its April sales. Just a drop of about a tenth of a percent. Not much movement here in extended trading. Net sales up 3% on a year-over-year basis, but comp sales in the US up just below 1%, up 9/10 of a percent. Total comp sales up 1.4%. E-commerce-- some weakness there. Those sales declining 5.9% year to date. Shares of Costco up just about 7%.And another look at the housing sector with Zillow out with its earnings after the bell. You're looking at gains of just about 4%.

ZG,5 big analyst picks: Comcast upgraded to Buy following super quarter | Pro Recap,"Investing.com -- Here is your Pro Recap of the biggest analyst picks you may have missed today.BofA Securities upgraded Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) to Buy from Neutral and raised its price target to $49.00 from $44.00 after a ""super"" quarter.According to BofA Securities, stronger-than-anticipated results in Content & Experiences (C&E), a net increase in broadband subscribers, and solid cost control/reductions at Connectivity & Platforms (C&P) drove the beat. The firm sees Comcast at a turning point, with promising prospects for a robust media operations turnaround, and its connectivity business enjoying low churn, substantial ARPU growth, and solid growth in Business Services.Bernstein upgraded Zillow (NASDAQ:ZG) to Market Perform from Underperform and raised its price target to $45.00 from $35.00. This follows the firm’s May 2022 coverage initiation which expressed concerns about negative revision risks in revenues and profits. Since then, revenue and adjusted EBITDA forecasts have dropped significantly.According to the firm, the easing of comps and signs of a bottomed core business have increased its optimism about Zillow's prospects. However, to warrant an Outperform rating, the firm seeks more visibility on the recovery curve and acknowledges that the revenue outlook is still uncertain and the stock isn't particularly cheap.The company is set to report its Q1/23 earnings on Wednesday after the market close.Morgan Stanley upgraded General Motors (NYSE:GM) to Overweight from Equalweight and raised its price target to $38.00 from $35.00, noting it believes the stock is “oversold” and offers an attractive risk-reward.Northland Capital Markets upgraded Power Integrations (NASDAQ:POWI) to Outperform from Market Perform with a price target of $82.00, noting it estimates strong quarter-over-quarter growth in Q2 and Q3, up 15% and 25%, respectively. “These numbers could prove to be low relative to a potential Q1 beat and Q2 raise,” added the firm.Shares gained 3% today.The company will report its Q1/23 earnings on Thursday after the market close.Stifel upgraded Scotts Miracle-Gro (NYSE:SMG) to Buy from Hold and raised its price target to $80.00 from $65.00, outlining an attractive near-term set-up for the shares with a margin recovery enabling outsized EPS growth alongside advantaged long-term growth prospects it believes are undervalued at current levels.The stock has experienced fluctuations in price, and there has been a lot of attention paid to the negative impact of weather conditions in March.

ZG,"How Housing Market Could Look by End of 2023, According to Experts","The national median list price was $424,000 in March 2023, an increase from $415,000 in February, according to Realtor.com. The yearly growth rate of the median list price dropped to 6.3% in March — the lowest growth rate since June 2020; it was 7.8% in February.By summertime, this could mean median sale prices likely will decline relative to 2022, according to Realtor.com. In February, the national median sale price dropped on an annual basis for the first time in more than 10 years.However, the Zillow Home Value Index is 3% higher than one year ago, according to the Zillow March 2023 Market Report. Of course, this largely varies by city. In March 2023, the Zillow Home Value Index surged 8.3% in Miami and 7% in Richmond, Virginia, but declined 9.4% in San Francisco and 7.5% in Austin, Texas.So far in early spring, he said, sellers have been holding onto their properties, which is helping to stabilize home prices.“Like in big cities, many rural areas are experiencing housing shortages,” he said. “Demand in select rural areas will grow as workers continue to telecommute.”He said people also are continuing to migrate to the southern states.“I look for interesting dynamics to unfold as price points in rural areas are more attractive compared to larger urban centers areas,” he said.Ultimately, he said, housing prices at the end of 2023 will depend on where you live.“I could see further decline, albeit minimally, in the western half of the country and a slightly positive number for the eastern half. — maybe on the whole a 1% increase,” he said. “Some rural areas, especially in the Carolinas, may see growth above 1%.”He said this all depends on interest rates.“If we see them get into the 5% range, we will see sellers who have been sitting on the sidelines because of their rate put their homes on market and millions more buyers nationally also get back in,” he said. “This will fuel higher prices because the excess demand has just been waiting for an acceptable interest rate range to get back into the market.”He said the current market might look like a bubble, but it isn’t for a variety of reasons. This includes mortgage lending becoming more stringent, a decline in the popularity of adjustable-rate mortgages, low housing inventory keeping demand high and low foreclosure rates.“These trends forecast that towards the third quarter of 2023, market conditions might be better and more stable,” he said.He also noted that different areas will see different types of price changes.“Homes in rural areas are selling much faster than in 2022,” he said. “Properties in suburban and rural areas will continue to remain popular as post-Covid remote work continues to motivate buyers to prioritize space over city living.”While plenty of speculation can be done, there’s ultimately no real way to know what home prices will be by the end of 2023. If you’re waiting to make a move, keep a close eye on properties that compare to the type you’re looking to buy or sell in your area.More From GOBankingRates5 Expensive Renovations Homeowners Always RegretFinancial Insight in Your Inbox: Sign Up for GBR's Daily Newsletter3 Ways to Recession Proof Your Retirement14 Ways to Invest That Don't Involve the Stock Market","April 29, 2023 at 5:00 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/housing-market-could-look-end-180009430.html,GOBankingRates,0.0,0.0,0.11803797717434082,0.36760350255804797,2023-04-29 05:00:00,2023-04-29 05:00:00,,,

ZG,Zillow CEO to face questions in rival real estate platform's lawsuit,"By Mike ScarcellaApril 26 (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Tuesday said Zillow Group Inc Chief Executive Rich Barton can be questioned in a rival real estate platform's antitrust lawsuit in Seattle federal court, over an objection that he has no material involvement in the issues in the case.U.S. District Judge Thomas Zilly said in an order that REX -Real Estate Exchange Inc could depose Barton for up to three hours in the company's lawsuit filed in 2021 accusing Zillow and National Association of Realtors (NAR) of anticompetitive business practices.Zillow's lawyers had opposed any questioning of Barton, who co-founded Zillow in 2005 and has served as CEO since 2019. Zillow reported $2 billion in revenue last year.REX's lawsuit alleged Zillow in 2021 redesigned its consumer website in concert with NAR to ""segregate, conceal and demote"" home listings that were not part of NAR's member-operated multiple listing services. They comprise the databases showing residential real estate for sale in regions across the country.The change allegedly caused views on REX's listings to ""plummet,"" the company said.REX wants to question Barton about Zillow's decision to join multiple listing services and also its move to buy houses and originate mortgages.A Zillow spokesperson on Tuesday said the company doesn't comment on pending cases, and a representative from NAR had no immediate comment.REX and its lawyers at Boies Schiller Flexner did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment.Zillow and NAR both have denied liability and are contesting claims in the lawsuit.Lawyers for Zillow dispute there was any agreement with NAR and deny that the website redesign harmed competition.Zillow's chief industry development officer was due to be questioned on Thursday, and the company's vice president of industry development has a deposition scheduled in May.The complaint is seeking unspecified monetary damages and an injunction ""from continuing to engage in any anticompetitive conduct.""A trial is scheduled for Sept. 18.The case is REX - Real Estate Exchange Inc v.

ZG,Analysts Estimate Zillow Group (ZG) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for,"Zillow Group (ZG) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on May 3. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis online real estate marketplace is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.12 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -75.5%.Revenues are expected to be $423.37 million, down 90.1% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 12.42% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Zillow?For Zillow, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -4.35%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Zillow will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Zillow would post earnings of $0.10 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.21, delivering a surprise of +110%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Zillow doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Zillow Group, Inc.

ZG,More buyers are purchasing mortgage points as a way to ease monthly costs,"15% more borrowers purchased mortgage points in 2022 than 2021, and continue to do so as interest rates hover around 6%Mortgage points, also known as discount points, are an option for buyers to pay an upfront fee to buy down the interest rate on a loan. The term ""points"" is a common way of referring to a percentage of your loan amount. When buyers choose to purchase mortgage discount points, they are essentially pre-paying interest up front in exchange for a lower rate and monthly payment.Regardless of income level, borrowers were more likely to purchase points for homes in the top and middle price tiers, than for homes in the bottom price tier.

ZG,"Gen Z Believes Winning the Lottery Is the Only Way To Afford a House, New Study Shows","New research from Zillow found that 52% of Gen Zers and 57% of millennials who don’t currently own a home believe they’d need to win the lottery to afford one.Since winning the lottery does not represent a sound financial plan, just about all younger Americans — 95% of Gen Zers and 94% of millennials — say they will need to make some serious life changes if they want to achieve the dream of home ownership.The Zillow survey of 2,066 U.S. adults — conducted in March and released on April 19 — found that roughly 40% of millennials said they would need to get a second or third job to afford a home right now. About 28% of Gen Zers said they’d have to make a career change in to afford one.The good news is, as of February 2023 the median sale price in the U.S. was down 1.2% from the previous year, according to Redfin. The bad news is, that median price was $386,721 — roughly 18% higher than the median sales price just three years earlier, according to Federal Reserve data.The current housing affordability crisis is the “worst it’s been in at least 15 years,” Zillow reported. Overall home values are up 3% over the past year… and that’s coming off an already high base. During the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, average home values rose by double digits.Those home values already priced many would-be buyers out of the market, and now they are being squeezed further by rising mortgage rates.“These findings highlight the gap between Gen Z and millennials’ dream of owning a home and their ability to actually make it happen,” Zillow home trends expert Amanda Pendleton said in a press release. “Mortgage rates have been on the rise since last year, sending monthly housing costs through the roof.”The typical monthly mortgage payment is now $431 higher than a year ago, Pendleton added. When you combine rising rates with record-breaking home value appreciation, “it’s easy to understand why younger generations are wondering how they’ll ever be able to afford a home,” she said.If you’re a first-time buyer looking to take the plunge this year, Zillow recommended starting out by coming up with a price you can afford. Using a mortgage calculator and affordability calculator can help you arrive at the right number.After that, Zillow advised reading reviews of realtors in your area to find out which ones get the best scores. You should also get pre-approved for a mortgage so you are ready to hit the ground running if the perfect home suddenly comes on the market.More From GOBankingRates10 Aldi Brand Products Worth BuyingLearn To Master Your Money With These Financial TipsHow to Build a Financial Plan From ZeroFinancial Insight in Your Inbox: Sign Up for GBR's Daily Newsletter","April 20, 2023 at 7:15 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gen-z-believes-winning-lottery-141533304.html,GOBankingRates,0.21212121212121213,0.7348484848484849,0.09747715247715248,0.40270547739297746,2023-04-20 07:15:00,2023-04-20 07:15:00,44.290000915527344,44.040000915527344,0.25

That’s because there is a high demand and short supply of housing in the city.On the other hand, Qiu suggests, investing in a house in Seattle can be a better long-term investment.“Houses in Seattle typically appreciate in value over time, and you can expect a higher return on investment compared to a condo. A house also offers more space, privacy and flexibility than a condo, making it a more attractive option for families or those who plan to live in the property.”Zillow 2023 median home value: $901,291Anywhere you go along California’s coastline, you’ll run into the same issue when it comes to buying a home: price.Ang says that in Los Angeles there is not much of a difference between houses and condos in terms of investment returns. Overall, though, Ang suggests that “condos may be the better option due their generally lower prices and higher rental yields.”Zillow 2023 median home value: $398,908With all the new construction projects Phoenix, buying a house could be the right choice when it comes to investing. However, don’t underestimate what a condo can do.“A more accessible entry point into the city’s real estate market may be provided through condos, which frequently include facilities like a fitness [center] or pool,” explains Edwards, who says that Phoenix is on par with most major cities when it comes to real estate purchasing.“Alternatively, homes offer more solitude and may have a yard or outside space. The investor’s financial situation and lifestyle preferences will ultimately determine whether to purchase a condo or a home.”Zillow 2023 median home value: $272,270While houses in Chicago may be the better investment due to lower purchase prices and solid rental yields, it is still worth exploring all factors.One other thing to take into account, according to Dowski, is school district. “It doesn’t matter if the property is great and cheap, if it’s in a bad school area, you’re not going to get anybody willing to rent it,” Dowski explains. “And if you do, you’re not going to be willing to rent to them, if you know what I mean.”Zillow 2023 median home value: $622,280Big Apple condos generally have higher rental yields, plus the draw of living in one of the biggest, most exciting cities in the world.“Houses, especially in Manhattan, are much more expensive, and most small investors cannot afford to purchase a house,” explains Shapot. “The tenant pool for houses in NYC is more limited than for condos, again because of price. But, the greater the risk, the greater the potential reward.”Zillow 2023 median home value: $213,244“In Philadelphia, I think a house is a better investment,” says Franqui. “In general, houses seem to hold their value and appreciate more than condos. Houses are typically easier to resell, as there is more demand for houses in Philadelphia.”Additionally, Franqui cites that the majority of Philadelphia renters are not renting apartments or condos, but instead, they are renting houses.“Since the start of the pandemic, houses, which provide more space and usually some outdoor space, have seemed to be in higher demand than smaller units like condos,” Franqui explains.“For the same price, a condo will typically have a higher monthly carrying cost when you factor in condo dues,” Franqui says. “The higher monthly costs often make it more challenging to cover your costs with a renter, as condos don’t necessarily command a higher rent. The main advantage to a condo is less direct maintenance, as things like roofs, common areas, etc., are a shared responsibility.”So what is the best overall investment no matter what city you live in: a condo or a house?“Condominiums, on the other hand, are subject to association fees and may have more restrictions on renovations or modifications,” Sanchez explains. “Houses typically provide greater space, privacy and flexibility. Homeowners have greater control over their property and can make changes or improvements as they see fit. Owning a house can [also] be more expensive and requires more maintenance and upkeep than a condo.”The bottom line: assess your financial goals, look at your city’s market trends and determine which long-term growth investment makes the most sense for you.More From GOBankingRates5 Expensive Renovations Homeowners Always RegretFinancial Insight in Your Inbox: Sign Up for GBR's Daily NewsletterHow to Build a Financial Plan From ZeroThe 10 Best Credit Cards for 2023","April 19, 2023 at 5:11 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/condo-vs-house-best-investment-193543869.html,GOBankingRates,1.0,0.3,0.17796943078496483,0.44756801720393957,2023-04-19 17:11:00,2023-04-19 17:11:00,43.79999923706055,44.72999954223633,-0.9300003051757812
ZG,Entry-level home shoppers most likely to face bidding wars this spring,"Prices rose by 8% annually for the least-expensive one-third of houses; the most-expensive homes lost value for the first time in more than a decade.The recent uptick in inventory hasn't included the least-expensive houses — bottom-tier inventory is up just 1% from last year, compared to a 13% boost for top-tier homes.A slight annual recovery in inventory has left out entry-level shoppers. There are just 1% more homes available for sale in the bottom price tier compared to 8% and 13% more in the slower-moving middle and top tiers, respectively.In the recent past, entry-level shoppers had an easier time finding discounts than their well-heeled colleagues, but that comparative benefit is gone now, too. The share of mid- and top-tier homes that sold above list price rose far above the bottom-tier share through most of the pandemic. Super-low rates had cranked up demand for more-expensive houses. But after mortgage rates peaked at 7% last fall, the share sold above list price for all three tiers converged; now they're tracking together.United States8 %-1 %48 %33 %1 %13 %New York, NY5 %0 %34 %19 %-24 %-9 %Los Angeles, CA0 %-6 %35 %28 %-18 %2 %Chicago, IL6 %0 %40 %19 %-19 %-13 %Dallas, TX2 %-1 %44 %40 %3 %15 %Houston, TX4 %2 %41 %33 %12 %28 %Washington, DC3 %-2 %26 %22 %-32 %-3 %Philadelphia, PA8 %4 %43 %31 %-7 %-12 %Miami, FL16 %6 %64 %54 %18 %48 %Atlanta, GA6 %1 %64 %39 %-1 %9 %Boston, MA4 %-1 %34 %24 %-32 %4 %Phoenix, AZ-2 %-3 %46 %40 %1 %55 %San Francisco, CA-5 %-14 %26 %16 %-37 %2 %Riverside, CA1 %-4 %48 %34 %0 %15 %Detroit, MI5 %1 %54 %27 %9 %-2 %Seattle, WA-3 %-11 %35 %32 %-32 %6 %Minneapolis, MN1 %-1 %26 %23 %-22 %8 %San Diego, CA1 %-6 %41 %43 %-38 %-1 %Tampa, FL8 %2 %69 %51 %26 %59 %Denver, CO-1 %-5 %29 %25 %-4 %47 %Baltimore, MD8 %2 %35 %25 %-7 %-12 %St. Louis, MO8 %2 %45 %27 %2 %-1 %Orlando, FL8 %3 %53 %43 %12 %41 %Charlotte, NC7 %1 %65 %45 %30 %29 %San Antonio, TX5 %1 %43 %37 %42 %63 %Portland, OR-1 %-4 %30 %25 %-32 %11 %Sacramento, CA-3 %-7 %32 %24 %-36 %2 %Pittsburgh, PA0 %0 %45 %21 %-6 %9 %Cincinnati, OH9 %3 %52 %32 %-17 %3 %Austin, TX-6 %-8 %48 %45 %30 %95 %Las Vegas, NV0 %-5 %34 %27 %9 %38 %Kansas City, MO7 %2 %51 %31 %5 %12 %Columbus, OH8 %3 %54 %33 %-10 %16 %Indianapolis, IN6 %1 %57 %37 %8 %32 %Cleveland, OH6 %4 %47 %30 %-1 %2 %San Jose, CA-1 %-11 %31 %24 %-54 %16 %Nashville, TN6 %-1 %55 %48 %25 %67 %Virginia Beach, VA8 %3 %40 %29 %-16 %-9 %Providence, RI6 %2 %42 %35 %-34 %-13 %Jacksonville, FL7 %2 %61 %51 %49 %63 %Milwaukee, WI8 %3 %39 %21 %-32 %-21 %Oklahoma City, OK10 %4 %56 %31 %-9 %77 %Raleigh, NC4 %0 %54 %43 %2 %66 %Memphis, TN8 %2 %62 %35 %7 %36 %Richmond, VA21 %-3 %67 %21 %-12 %-8 %Louisville, KY10 %2 %47 %27 %-6 %2 %New Orleans, LA11 %-1 %34 %17 %49 %48 %Salt Lake City, UT-2 %-5 %43 %36 %6 %66 %Hartford, CT9 %5 %43 %31 %-32 %-9 %Buffalo, NY4 %2 %41 %28 %-1 %-2 %SOURCE Zillow","April 20, 2023 at 2:00 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/entry-level-home-shoppers-most-090000647.html,PR Newswire,0.25,0.75,0.18333333333333332,0.3401515151515151,2023-04-20 02:00:00,2023-04-20 02:00:00,44.290000915527344,44.040000915527344,0.25
ZG,"Some Confidence Is Lacking In Zillow Group, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:ZG) P/S"," See our latest analysis for Zillow Group While the industry has experienced revenue growth lately, Zillow Group's revenue has gone into reverse gear, which is not great. One possibility is that the P/S ratio is high because investors think this poor revenue performance will turn the corner. If not, then existing shareholders may be extremely nervous about the viability of the share price.Zillow Group's P/S ratio would be typical for a company that's expected to deliver very strong growth, and importantly, perform much better than the industry.Retrospectively, the last year delivered a frustrating 8.2% decrease to the company's top line. The last three years don't look nice either as the company has shrunk revenue by 29% in aggregate. Accordingly, shareholders would have felt downbeat about the medium-term rates of revenue growth.Shifting to the future, estimates from the analysts covering the company suggest revenue should grow by 7.4% per year over the next three years. That's shaping up to be similar to the 7.5% per year growth forecast for the broader industry.With this information, we find it interesting that Zillow Group is trading at a high P/S compared to the industry. It seems most investors are ignoring the fairly average growth expectations and are willing to pay up for exposure to the stock. Although, additional gains will be difficult to achieve as this level of revenue growth is likely to weigh down the share price eventually.We'd say the price-to-sales ratio's power isn't primarily as a valuation instrument but rather to gauge current investor sentiment and future expectations.Given Zillow Group's future revenue forecasts are in line with the wider industry, the fact that it trades at an elevated P/S is somewhat surprising. When we see revenue growth that just matches the industry, we don't expect elevates P/S figures to remain inflated for the long-term. A positive change is needed in order to justify the current price-to-sales ratio.","April 19, 2023, 3:55 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/confidence-lacking-zillow-group-inc-105556454.html,Simply Wall St.,0.0,0.0,0.1160966810966811,0.5507431457431456,2023-04-19 03:55:00,2023-04-19 03:55:00,43.79999923706055,44.72999954223633,-0.9300003051757812
ZG,More than half of Gen Zers and millennials believe they'd need to win the lottery to afford a home,"New Zillow survey finds younger generations still believe owning a home is part of the American dream, but they don't know how they'll achieve itOutside of winning the lottery, large shares of both generations (95% of Gen Zers and 94% of millennials) say they would have to make some life changes in order to make their dream of homeownership a reality. About 40% of millennials say they would need to get a second or third job, and 28% of Gen Zers say they'd have to make a career change in order to afford a home right now.The housing affordability crisis is the worst it's been in at least 15 years. Home values are up 3% over the past year, but during the peak of the pandemic, home values were rising in the double-digits. Record-fast home value growth has already been squeezing budgets, and now rising mortgage rates are compounding the affordability challenges many buyers are facing.When it comes to a down payment — a major barrier to homeownership — 36% of Gen Zers say they'd give up their beloved social media if it meant magically having enough cash to put down on a starter home.Still, these two generations are optimistic about the future. About two-thirds of the Gen Zers and millennials surveyed say it's realistic to think they can buy a home within the next five years.For first-time buyers looking to get in the game this spring, here are a few tips that could help make the dream of homeownership a reality:Gen Zers Millennials Win the lottery52 %57 %26 %27 %Get a second or third job27 %39 %Move to a different city20 %25 %Marry someone with savings26 %16 %Change careers28 %22 %Survey MethodologyAbout Zillow Group SOURCE Zillow","April 19, 2023, 5:00 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/more-half-gen-zers-millennials-120000489.html,PR Newswire,0.37777777777777777,0.35555555555555557,0.05134830447330446,0.35434317666460524,2023-04-19 05:00:00,2023-04-19 05:00:00,43.79999923706055,44.72999954223633,-0.9300003051757812

MTCH,DEA administrator: Technology has 'transformed drug trafficking',"One reason for this is that social media has solved a ""last mile problem"" for cartels, Milgram explained.""They've got to get that drug into someone's hands,"" she said. ""It's that last mile, which is how a drug cartel that's making fentanyl pills in Mexico gets to a teenager... and social media has made it so much more anonymous.""""A young person will walk into their room, and open up their phone or computer… but that same young person would be really hesitant to walk into an open air drug market and buy heroin like they would have had to 20 years ago,"" Milgram added. ""It's a totally different world.”When someone dies from a drug poisoning, investigating agents will often, very early on, access their phones and social media accounts.""Our agents will go out and they'll access the victim's phone, and we'll find the deal on Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat, or TikTok,"" Milgram said.It's also a cross-platform endeavor, as one transaction can move through many different apps.""Drug traffickers are often on multiple social media sites and payment apps,"" Milgram said. ""Social media makes people feel connected for life.""However, as much as tech has been successfully leveraged by cartels, it can also be a way to spread awareness, according to Milgram.""I think tech could play a huge role in awareness, and I think it has to be part of that conversation,"" she said. ""Anything that tech can do to spread the word is vital. A young person thinks they're buying oxycontin or Xanax, but they don't know that they're buying fentanyl. Six out of ten times, that can be potentially deadly.""The DEA is also evolving to keep up with the pace of change, Milgram said.""We think about globalization and how it's changed the entire world — the cartels have just evolved their entire business model to harness encrypted applications, social media, and cryptocurrency,"" she said. ""They've taken everything they do and adapted it, whether it's recruiting couriers on social media or selling the pills on social media apps... So a big part of what we're doing is transforming the DEA to have the data and technology, so we are as prepared as possible to meet this threat.""Recently, Milgram and Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco held a meeting with senior leadership at several tech companies. Though conversations have been ongoing for some time between Big Tech and the DEA, the meeting was in-person and, in many ways, the first of its kind.""Our message was that this is an emergency and we need them to do more, like make zero tolerance part of their policy,"" she said.","May 14, 2023 at 8:34 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dea-administrator-technology-has-transformed-drug-trafficking-153410271.html,Yahoo Finance,0.0,0.0,0.11837301587301588,0.3360714285714286,2023-05-14 08:34:00,2023-05-14 08:34:00,,,

MTCH,25 Best Cities for Singles in the U.S.,"One area of daily living that technology has managed to disrupt is dating. Gone are the days when men and women had to actually go out and meet strangers to find that perfect match. Instead, applications like Tinder let you browse through user profiles simply through the palm of your hand, and, if you're lucky, match up with a potential partner.Naturally, these players operate on a global level, and their scale makes it difficult for incumbents to launch alternatives on a similar scale. Some of the newer entrants in the industry are Snack, a video dating application; Thursday, a rather interesting application that is available only on Thursdays; Heart to Heart, an application that lets users also send voice notes to each other; and Schmooze which lets you match on meme choice. Looking at this handful of examples, it's clear that newer entrants are getting creative with their applications to wrest away market share from the larger companies. Additionally, just as small businesses can benefit from targeting the right local markets, so can these companies, especially since dating is a local phenomenon. After all, you're unlikely to match or go out with someone from Tokyo if you're living in New York. Some strategies for small businesses targeting local markets that those in the dating industry can also follow include developing a unique selling proposition, separating the market by geography, and evaluating the market in terms of growth potential.We expect the company overall as well as Tinder to have accelerating year-over-year revenue growth as we move through 2023 driven by improved product execution leading to improved revenue momentum at Tinder. In terms of AOI, we expect improving year-over-year margins in the back half of the year as the benefits of our cost savings initiatives take hold and Tinder top line growth accelerates. Our cost savings initiatives are focused on rightsizing headcount and reducing overhead costs, including office expenses and professional fees. We expect to reduce our global workforce by approximately 8% in aggregate. We’ve already reduced roles in the U.S. In other countries, this process is ongoing. We expect to incur $6 million of severance and similar costs related to our cost savings initiatives in 2023.With these details in mind, let's take a look at some of the best cities in America for singles.Our MethodologyInsider Monkey's Score: 21.2 Houston is one of the largest cities in Texas in terms of population.Insider Monkey's Score: 21Durham is one of the most populous cities in North Carolina.

MTCH,TripAdvisor (TRIP) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Next Week's Release,"TripAdvisor (TRIP) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on May 3. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis travel website operator is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.04 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +144.4%.Revenues are expected to be $357.75 million, up 36.6% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 3.33% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for TripAdvisor?For TripAdvisor, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +90.91%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that TripAdvisor will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that TripAdvisor would post earnings of $0.05 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.16, delivering a surprise of +220%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.TripAdvisor appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAmong the stocks in the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry, Match Group (MTCH) is soon expected to post earnings of $0.40 per share for the quarter ended March 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -46%.

MTCH,10 Growth Stocks Jim Cramer is Talking About,"""Nobody can blame the Fed for slowing down the pace of its rate hikes. Until a few weeks ago, we didn't care that so many banks had taken their Covid-boosted deposits and invested them in longer-term bonds that were practically guaranteed to take losses in the event of aggressive rate hikes, which we got. We didn't have a clue that old-fashioned bank runs could happen so swiftly.""""In a sluggish economy, the Wall Street playbook says you buy tech, but not just any tech. You buy tech that's brimming with cash and doesn't need to tap the equity or bond markets.

YELP,Yelp Sets Goal of Reaching Net Zero by 2031 in Latest ESG Report,"Commitment to sustainable investing includes $25 million in Green Deposits and integrating ESG filters in its investment portfolio""Embracing remote work has created an opportunity for us to develop a new playbook as we move beyond traditionally held beliefs around an office-centric workplace,"" said Jeremy Stoppelman, Yelp co-founder and CEO. ""Remote work has allowed us to accelerate Yelp’s carbon reduction efforts and our ability to hire diverse talent from around the globe. Our goal of reaching net zero by 2031 reflects Yelp’s deep commitment to doing what we can to protect our planet for future generations.""As part of the report, Yelp also outlined its commitment to sustainable investments, including implementing ESG filters in its investment portfolio, which exclude future investments in issuers with revenues from thermal coal extraction, oil sands and other revenue sources that do not meet Yelp’s ESG standards. Yelp also invested $25 million in Green Deposits, which are earmarked to fund qualifying Green Loans in the U.S. These Green Loans support environmental projects like clean transportation, energy efficiency, green buildings and sustainable water/wastewater management, providing another way for Yelp to sustainably invest in the local communities it serves.About Yelp Inc.Yelp Inc.

YELP,3 Reasons Why Growth Investors Shouldn't Overlook Yelp (YELP),"Investors seek growth stocks to capitalize on above-average growth in financials that help these securities grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all.In addition to volatility, these stocks carry above-average risk by their very nature. Also, one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end.However, the task of finding cutting-edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.Our proprietary system currently recommends Yelp (YELP) as one such stock. This company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this online business reviews company a great growth pick right now.Earnings GrowthEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.While the historical EPS growth rate for Yelp is 18%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 86.4% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 22.5%.Impressive Asset Utilization RatioGrowth investors often overlook asset utilization ratio, also known as sales-to-total-assets (S/TA) ratio, but it is an important feature of a real growth stock. This metric shows how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales.Right now, Yelp has an S/TA ratio of 1.2, which means that the company gets $1.2 in sales for each dollar in assets. Comparing this to the industry average of 0.7, it can be said that the company is more efficient.While the level of efficiency in generating sales matters a lot, so does the sales growth of a company. And Yelp is well positioned from a sales growth perspective too. The company's sales are expected to grow 9.1% this year versus the industry average of 0%.Promising Earnings Estimate RevisionsSuperiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.There have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for Yelp. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 1.3% over the past month.Bottom LineWhile the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Yelp a Zacks Rank #2 stock, it has earned itself a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This combination positions Yelp well for outperformance, so growth investors may want to bet on it.Yelp Inc.

YELP,"YELP's Q1 Loss Narrower Than Estimated, Revenues Rise YoY","Meanwhile, Yelp’s revenues increased 13% year over year to $312 million and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $306.2 million. The top line primarily reflected growth in advertising revenues.Yelp Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseYelp Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Yelp Inc. QuoteAdvertising revenues (95.2% of total revenues) climbed 13% year over year to $297.1 million. This upside can primarily be attributed to higher customer spending and an increase in Paying Advertising Locations in both Services and Restaurants, Retail & Other categories.Paying Advertising Locations reached 554,000, up 1.5% from the year-ago quarter and 1.7% from the previous quarter. Within key categories, Paying Advertising Locations for Services business as well as Restaurants, Retail & Other categories increased 7,000 and 2,000, respectively, from the fourth-quarter 2022 figures.Within Advertising, Services revenues grew 15% year over year to $183.5 million on approximately 25% growth in the Home Services category and an increase in Paying Advertising Locations.Transaction revenues were $4 million in the first quarter, up 12% year over year, driven by an increase in per-order transaction fee from Grubhub post renewal of partnership in March 2022. This was partially offset by lower food take-out and delivery order volumes, as several restaurants resumed and increased their dine-in operations.Other revenues jumped 15% to $12 million, driven by the strong adoption of its Yelp Fusion program introduced in 2020.Total costs and expenses flared up 13% year over year to $319 million, reflecting the company’s continued investments in its long-term growth initiatives.Yelp’s first-quarter adjusted EBITDA increased 12% year over year to $54 million. The adjusted EBITDA margin remained flat year over year at 17%.As of Mar 31, 2023, Yelp’s cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities were $414.2 million without any debt.During first-quarter 2023, the company generated an operating cash flow of $74.2 million. Yelp repurchased shares worth $50 million during the reported quarter.For the second quarter of 2023, Yelp projects revenues between $320 million and $330 million.Management expects adjusted EBITDA in the $60-$70 million band for the second quarter.For full-year 2023, the company estimates revenues between $1.295 billion and $1.315 billion.

YELP,Yelp (YELP) Beats Q1 Earnings and Revenue Estimates,"Yelp (YELP) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.02 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $0.08 per share.

Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions.

other income, net; depreciation and amortization; stock-based compensation expense; and, in certain periods, certain other income and expense items, such as impairment charges. We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by net revenue.Adjusted EBITDA, which is not prepared under any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles, has limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of Yelp’s financial results as reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (""GAAP""). In particular, Adjusted EBITDA should not be viewed as a substitute for, or superior to, net income (loss) prepared in accordance with GAAP as a measure of profitability or liquidity. Some of these limitations are:although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect all cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements;Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, Yelp's working capital needs;Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the impact of the recording or release of valuation allowances or tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to Yelp;Adjusted EBITDA does not consider the potentially dilutive impact of equity-based compensation;Adjusted EBITDA does not take into account any income or costs that management determines are not indicative of ongoing operating performance, such as impairment charges; andother companies, including those in Yelp’s industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure.Because of these limitations, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin alongside other financial performance measures, net income (loss) and Yelp’s other GAAP results.The following is a reconciliation of net loss to Adjusted EBITDA, as well as the calculation of net loss margin and Adjusted EBITDA margin, for each of the periods indicated (in thousands, except percentages; unaudited):Three Months EndedMarch 31,20232022Reconciliation of Net Loss to Adjusted EBITDA:Net loss$(1,178)$(915)Benefit from income taxes(197)(2,612)Other income, net(5,212)(929)Depreciation and amortization10,80511,490Stock-based compensation46,25741,0603,555—Adjusted EBITDA$54,030$48,094Net revenue$312,438$276,628Net loss margin—%—%Adjusted EBITDA margin17%17%Contacts","May 4, 2023 at 1:05 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/demand-yelp-advertising-products-drove-200500780.html,Business Wire,0.3416666666666667,0.5333333333333333,0.027524468285337847,0.33184053265575,2023-05-04 13:05:00,2023-05-04 13:05:00,27.209999084472656,27.290000915527344,-0.0800018310546875
YELP,Earnings Preview: Yelp (YELP) Q1 Earnings Expected to Decline,"The market expects Yelp (YELP) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on May 4. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis online business reviews company is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.08 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -700%.Revenues are expected to be $306.17 million, up 10.7% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Yelp?For Yelp, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -28.21%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Yelp will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Yelp would post earnings of $0.31 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.28, delivering a surprise of -9.68%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release.

YELP,Yelp is using AI to help users write reviews,"When writing a review on Yelp, users now see topics—like “Food,” “Service,” and “Ambiance”—above the draft post that help them keep track of what they’ve covered and remind them what they may want to address. Once a topic is covered, it turns green with a checkmark.Read moreWhole Foods has shut down a store in downtown San Francisco on safety concernsYour anxiety brings 4 distinct superpowersAmericans may have seen the last of big rent hikesFor now, this AI writing guidance is only available for restaurants, but the company plans to expand it to more categories such as services, beauty, and health. “We know that sometimes you may develop writer’s block when crafting reviews,” Yelp said in a press release.Yelp shows how AI is meant to “help more people to do less of the operational aspects of finding the information or trying to summarize it in their mind,” so they can focus on the discovery, said Akhil Kuduvalli Ramesh, the company’s VP of consumer product.Lately, the company has trained its AI models on its own data and third-party sources to roll out not just review assistance but also features that help people search more efficiently. Yelp users can now see results beyond their search location without having to adjust it manually, as well as relevant snippets highlighted from reviews under each listing. More specific reviews and nuanced searches could also mean more usage of Yelp, which needs to compete with Google search.For instance, when you search for “tennis courts,” in addition to a list of parks and sports facilities, you’ll see details like “There are tennis courts that you need to book in advance.”“[As] a product manager, personally, I wouldn’t want them to wonder,” he added. “I want the app to be as intuitive helpful and relevant as possible...and they should feel like it’s a seamless, intuitive experience that just helps them.”More from QuartzThe world’s biggest banknote printer said the demand for cash hit a two-decade lowWhat were the world's busiest airports in 2022?Click here to read the full article.","April 25, 2023 at 10:57 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/yelp-using-ai-help-users-175700757.html,Quartz,0.0,0.0,0.20501207729468596,0.4602053140096619,2023-04-25 10:57:00,2023-04-25 10:57:00,29.0,28.540000915527344,0.45999908447265625
