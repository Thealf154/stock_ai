AMZN,Cloud Spending Is Slowing. Here's Why Tech Investors Shouldn't Panic.,"The latest batch of quarterly earnings reports from the top cloud computing companies indicated an unnerving trend: Spending from cloud clients is slowing down. Investors are already concerned about rising interest rates and a potential recession, so hearing management from Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) say that customers are somewhat backing off of cloud spending right now didn't exactly instill confidence. You'd have to ignore some really huge cloud computing trends to think the market is on the decline.","May 8, 2023 at 6:45 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/m/85fcd5a7-703f-317d-89eb-3b1bdc9905b5/cloud-spending-is-slowing..html,Motley Fool,0.0,0.0,0.25430839002267575,0.6249433106575965
AMZN,Be Wary Of Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) And Its Returns On Capital,"For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. To calculate this metric for Amazon.com, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities) See our latest analysis for Amazon.com When we looked at the ROCE trend at Amazon.com, we didn't gain much confidence. Around five years ago the returns on capital were 6.4%, but since then they've fallen to 4.2%. On the other hand, the company has been employing more capital without a corresponding improvement in sales in the last year, which could suggest these investments are longer term plays. It may take some time before the company starts to see any change in earnings from these investments.To conclude, we've found that Amazon.com is reinvesting in the business, but returns have been falling. Unsurprisingly, the stock has only gained 32% over the last five years, which potentially indicates that investors are accounting for this going forward. So if you're looking for a multi-bagger, the underlying trends indicate you may have better chances elsewhere.","May 8, 2023 at 6:00 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wary-amazon-com-nasdaq-amzn-110025938.html,Simply Wall St.,-0.5,0.7,0.13125,0.47986111111111107
AMZN,4 Reasons You Should Cancel Amazon Prime,"At the beginning of 2022, the cost of Amazon Prime was $119 annually. The price increase for Prime membership plans went into effect on Feb. 18, 2022. The increase to $139 was a 15% increase over the previous price.While there is no confirmed statement or upcoming plans regarding another price hike on Prime, it is possible Amazon could increase prices again. Members who cancel now would be able to pocket $139 in savings immediately on membership fees.If you find most of your shopping purchases are made through Amazon, you may be less likely to cancel your membership. This is especially true of households that depend on the free two-day delivery or two-hour grocery delivery services.However, if you rarely shop at Amazon or your spending habits have changed significantly, you’re not likely to be getting your money’s worth in keeping the membership.Amazon Prime members receive access to Prime Video, Prime Gaming, Prime Music and access to Kindle Owners’ Lending Library. These are all perks of Prime — if you’re using them, of course.Maybe you subscribe to other streaming services for movies, TV and music. You might have a separate gaming console you love. Or you enjoy visiting the library to check out physical books and e-books. If you find you can easily live without these additional entertainment perks, it may be easier to cancel Amazon Prime.Some members of Amazon Prime may appreciate the swift way the service provides deliveries of groceries via Amazon Fresh or using the Amazon Pharmacy service.However, savvy shoppers may be focusing on other retailers and supermarkets where they can get even better deals.A frequent Costco or Sam’s Club shopper, for example, may be less inclined to give up their annual membership to these warehouse clubs or the benefits that come with these memberships. Shoppers at grocers like Aldi may enjoy the breadth of savings available to them while those who shop at Target can receive access to price-matching options. Still, other shoppers may wish to shop local and support small businesses in their communities. And some consumers may have different pharmacy preferences or visit a local pharmacist they have been with for a long time.Ultimately, Prime members need to weigh whether they’re getting a better deal with Prime versus other retailers.If you have decided a Prime membership no longer meets your needs, you can easily end it.Instructions on Amazon.com state members may go to their Prime membership account and select update, cancel and more options. Follow the on-screen instructions and you’ll be able to cancel Amazon Prime.More From GOBankingRates5 Expensive Renovations Homeowners Always RegretFinancial Insight in Your Inbox: Sign Up for GBR's Daily Newsletter3 Ways to Recession Proof Your Retirement7 Things You Must Do To Create a Plan for Your Money","May 8, 2023 at 8:30 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-reasons-cancel-amazon-prime-200113427.html,GOBankingRates,0.0,0.0,0.15117623604465708,0.5026629072681704
AMZN,"The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights Amazon.com MongoDB, Okta, Zscaler and Paycom Software","Chicago, IL – May 8, 2023 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog.

AMZN, MongoDB Inc. MDB, Okta Inc. OKTA, Zscaler Inc. ZS and Paycom Software Inc.

In its recently concluded May FOMC meeting, the Fed raised the benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to the range of 5-5.25%, marking the highest Fed Fund rate since August 2007.Fed Chairman Jerome Powell indicated that the ongoing rate hike cycle is perhaps reaching its end, although it will depend on the outcome of economic data. However, Powell has categorically denied any rate cut this year as inflation seems to be declining at a slow rate.As a result, the U.S. economy is suffering its biggest challenge in the regional banking segment. Three major regional banks have already collapsed and a large-section of economists and financial experts remain highly concerned about more casualties.In first-quarter 2023, the U.S. GDP growth rate came in at a moderate 1.1% compared with the consensus estimate of 2% and the fourth-quarter 2022 growth rate of 2.6%. Moreover, the Conference Board's Leading Economic Index, a gauge of future economic activity, dropped to 108.4 in March from February's revised reading of 109.7, its 12th successive monthly drop and the lowest reading since November 2020.Precipitous contraction in ISM manufacturing and services activities, a decline in orders of durable goods, a reduction in construction activities, and a freight recession are all signaling the possibility of a recession later this year. Fed Chair also acknowledged that the current banking turmoil in the United States has led to tighter credit conditions, and is likely to impact economic activities.Consequently, several large-cap stocks are currently available at attractive valuations.

AMZN,Time to Buy Alphabet and Amazon Stock After Q1 Earnings,"Let’s see why now may be a good time to buy these tech giants’ stocks after their first-quarter earnings last week.Alphabet Q1 Review Reporting Q1 earnings last Tuesday, Alphabet was able to put some of the fears that the company’s slower progress in ChatGPT would affect its search engine dominance. CEO Sundar Pichai stated the Search segment was performing well along with momentum in the Cloud segment.  This led to Q1 sales rising 3% from the prior year quarter at $58.06 billion which topped estimates by 1%.On the bottom line, first-quarter earnings nicely beat estimates by 10% at $1.17 per share despite dipping -5% from Q1 2022. More importantly, Alphabet put an end to a string of four consecutive quarters in which the company missed its bottom-line expectations.Amazon Q1 Review Amazon also had a solid first quarter after releasing its results last Thursday. The multi-operational behemoth expects slower cloud revenue growth at the moment but Amazon Web Services (AWS) sales were still up 16% YoY at $21.35 billion. Total sales for the quarter topped estimates by 2% at $127.35 billion and increased 9% from Q1 2022.Earnings widely topped expectations by 47% at $0.31 per share compared to EPS estimates of $0.21. This was also a 47% increase from the prior year quarter with Q1 2022 earnings at $0.21 per share.Growth & OutlookAlphabet and Amazon’s better-than-expected first-quarter results are reason to be optimistic about their outlooks and the possibility that operating conditions may begin to stabilize.To that point, Alphabet earnings are now forecasted to climb 18% this year and jump another 16% in FY24 at $6.25 per share. Earnings estimate revisions have remained higher over the last 30 days and are nicely up over the last quarter.On the top line, sales are projected to be up 6% in FY23 and rise another 10% in FY24 to $274.53 billion. Fiscal 2024 would represent 69% growth from pre-pandemic sales of $161.85 billion in 2019.Turning to Amazon, earnings are expected to continue to rebound and soar 117% in FY23 at $1.54 per share compared to EPS of $0.71 in 2022. Plus, FY24 EPS is forecasted to climb another 52% to $2.35 per share. Earnings estimates revisions have trended higher in the last week since Amazon’s Q1 report.Sales are projected to rise 9% this year and jump another 12% in FY24 to $629.96 billion. Furthermore, fiscal 2024 would be a very stellar 124% increase from 2019 pre-pandemic sales of $280.52 billion.TakeawaySimply put, Alphabet and Amazon’s first quarter reports started to reconfirm the tech giants anticipated annual growth and that inflationary concerns could potentially subside in the near future. Both tech giants currently land a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) as higher earnings estimate revisions are also supportive of buying shares right now.With Alphabet and Amazon stock both trading around $105 a share it’s starting to look more plausible that they will move closer to their Average Zacks Price Targets over the course of the year which are notably over $130 per share respectively.  Amazon.com, Inc.

AMZN,14 Items To Avoid at Walmart,"Whether you're in need of wrapping paper for a birthday gift, wedding present or Christmas surprise, you can save big by skipping Walmart and heading to the Dollar Store. Walmart charges $8.49 for one roll of a plain-colored wrapping paper. You can pick up a roll for only $1.25 at the Dollar Tree.Whether you're hosting a graduation party, an anniversary celebration or a baby shower, Walmart might be the first place you consider for party supplies. But if you're also hosting on a budget, you'll do better heading to the nearest dollar store.""Party supplies at Walmart can be up to five times the cost of party supplies at dollar stores,"" said Carson Yarbrough, a consumer insights specialist for Offers.com, a site for coupons and insider savings tips. ""If you're planning a party, opt to get party supplies like plastic cups, decorations and balloons at the dollar store to see significant savings.""There's nothing more exciting than watching your little one jump for joy when given a new toy, but you don't need to pay more to experience that same reaction. The Thomas & Friends Fix 'em Up Friends Toy Train Set costs $39.99 at Walmart, but you can save on it by buying it at Target for $18.99.Furniture can be expensive. So, if you're just starting out or looking for inexpensive pieces for your home, you might be lured by Walmart's low prices on wood furniture. Keep in mind, however, that you get what you pay for at these prices.""Walmart has relatively cheap wood furniture, but this is because it's a lesser quality than other furniture retailers,"" said Yarbrough. ""Wooden furniture from Walmart is more likely to break or deteriorate quicker, so buy your furniture elsewhere to save money and the hassle of replacing it in two months.""Many of us love to give our locks the luxury treatment with salon-quality shampoos and conditioners. However, shampoo is one of the items you should buy on Amazon instead of Walmart.At Walmart, 33.8 ounces of Nexxus Therappe Moisture Shampoo costs $25.98, but you'll pay $24.72 with free shipping on Amazon. You can use those savings to purchase some new hair ties to replace the ones you're always losing.Although Walmart offers a decent price of 12 cents per photo print, you can do better. There are several apps that give you the opportunity to order copies of your favorite photos for free. Shutterfly, for example, gets you started with unlimited free prints when you download its app. There's also an app called FreePrints that makes ordering pictures as easy as 1-2-3, and it also provides services free of charge. Customers simply pay for shipping, which still makes the purchase much cheaper than buying prints from Walmart.Crucial for operating everything from toys to remote controls, batteries are a must-have item around the house. The problem with Walmart, however, is that you'll likely spend a lot on batteries and get little in return.Right now, the retailer offers a four-pack of Energizer Ultimate AA Lithium Batteries for $14.76. But if you buy in bulk at Sam's Club, you'll get an 18-pack of the batteries for $34.98.Most people can't get their days started without a cup of joe. Because coffee is relatively inexpensive, you might not question Walmart's prices. But the truth is, competitors like Amazon typically sell the same brands of coffee for less.For example, Walmart's price for Maxwell House Original Roast Ground Coffee (30.6 ounces) is $10.46, but the coffee is sold at Amazon for $9.36.Many prospective college students head to Walmart to get items for their dorm rooms. This can include a minifridge for always having a cold drink on hand. Unfortunately, Walmart isn't the best place to get this appliance. Parents can save a significant amount of money by taking a few minutes to shop around. For example, if you purchased the Magic Chef 4.4 cubic feet Refrigerator at Walmart, you'd have to pay $355.59. After a little digging, you'd discover Home Depot sells the same minifridge for $249. That's a savings of over $100.Vitamin supplements can treat nutritional deficiencies, and some vitamins even improve the outlook for certain health conditions. But the cost of vitamins can add up over time, so it's important to find ways to save money. Rather than purchase vitamins from Walmart, compare prices to see if you can find your selections cheaper on Amazon.You'll save on Vitafusion MultiVites gummy vitamins, for example, when shopping on Amazon. A pack of two 150-count bottle is listed on Amazon for $21.90, whereas Walmart sells a single bottle for $12.47. You save $1.52 on each bottle buying from Amazon.You'll also save money by skipping Walmart and purchasing your Keurig K55 Brewer from another retailer. Walmart has this particular Keurig model for $169.96. For a cheaper option, head to Amazon where you'll find the same model for $109.99.Walmart's gift card center features a generous selection of restaurants and retailers, including Olive Garden, Papa John's, Starbucks and Burger King. Plus, there's the option to buy Visa, MasterCard and American Express gift cards. Walmart is a convenient place to pick up cards, but it isn't the cheapest place.A cost-saving solution involves buying from discount sites like Raise and Cardpool, which have gift cards for up to 30% and 35% off, respectively.With a prepaid or pay-as-you-go cellphone plan, you don't have to worry about a contract. And, you only pay for the minutes you use.Walmart's Straight Talk wireless is an affordable cellular solution, with its $55 monthly unlimited nationwide plan and 4G LTE data. This monthly price might agree with your wallet, it's certainly not the best deal in town. If you buy this same plan through Straight Talk Wireless' website, you can get the first three months at $50 per month when you automatically refill it.Walmart has a huge selection of kitchenware from drinking glasses to cooking items. But if you're on the hunt for simple, inexpensive kitchen merchandise like coffee mugs, flatware or bowls, there's no need to pay big retailer prices. Dollar stores might have exactly what you're looking for at a cheaper price.Why pay $5 for a basic coffee mug at Walmart when you can get mugs for $1 each at dollar stores?Most people want to save money. But just because a company claims to be the cheapest retailer on the block doesn't mean it's true. Even with Walmart coupons, you can potentially save elsewhere. With that being said, do your homework, shop around and compare prices at retailers -- your wallet will thank you.More From GOBankingRates10 Aldi Brand Products Worth BuyingLearn To Master Your Money With These Financial Tips3 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000Financial Insight in Your Inbox: Sign Up for GBR's Daily NewsletterPrices are accurate as of April 5, 2023.","May 5, 2023 at 5:00 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/14-items-avoid-walmart-230027641.html,GOBankingRates,0.0,0.0,0.15041801948051953,0.4703294101731602

AMZN,Which Amazon Services Are Worth the Money?,"An Amazon Prime membership, which costs $14.99 per month or $139 annually for an individual, includes a Prime Video subscription (or you can get it separately for $8.99 per month).Prime Video has stealthily been creeping up in inventory, quality and content in streaming services for some time now. According to CordCuttersNews.com, it offers some major benefits, such as original programming, like the award winning “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,” and “The Lord of the Rings: Rings of Power,” as well as live “Thursday Night Football” and WNBA games.Many shows that run on other networks eventually become available on Prime Video, as well, and it allows users to download offline, create multiple viewer profiles, and rent or buy movies and TV shows. You can also stack on and manage other streaming services through your Prime membership, such as HBO Max, Starz and Showtime, though you do pay additionally for each one.Competitor Netflix has long been a leader in both original and popular streaming content, with such award winning and original shows as “Ozark” and “Beef,” even with recent drops in stock prices. Netflix’s plans start as low as $6.99 per month, with ads, and go up to a premium subscription at $19.99 per month. The higher the tier, the more users you can have on one account, and at the premium tier you also get Netflix Spatial Audio, which enables a theater-like sound experience in a home theater.PC Magazine ultimately declares Netflix the winner over Amazon by a hair, due to “to innovative features and awesome originals.” However, if you already have an Amazon Prime membership, then you could certainly save money on streaming entertainment by not paying for other memberships.Most people know that one of the biggest perks of Amazon Prime is free one- and two-day shipping on hundreds of thousands of products, with a great return policy too. As mentioned above, for either $14.99 per month, or $139 per year, you can get an Amazon Prime subscription and save on all kinds of deliveries. Additionally, Amazon Prime offers discounts on its memberships to students, to people with EBT cards, and to people on Medicaid, according to PC Magazine.Enter the big-box retailer Walmart, which rolled out Walmart+ in 2020. This service is a bit cheaper than Prime at $12.95 per month or $98 per year. With this service, registered members can get free unlimited same-day grocery delivery from their local Walmart (with a $35 minimum order); free pickup of returned items from your home; free shipping on other non-grocery products without a minimum order; fuel savings on over 14,000 locations around the U.S. and the ability to earn Walmart rewards on every purchase.Both services are great, and both offer a 30 day free-trial period, but it’s a bit like comparing apples to oranges. Amazon has a wider selection of products and doesn’t require a shopper to be local to get discounts. A Walmart+ user will have to do the bulk of all of their shopping and gas purchases at Walmart to make the membership worthwhile, but if that is your primary place of shopping, it could be a great deal.Ultimately, a Prime membership will save you money on all kinds of shipping (not to mention saving you trips to a physical store). So if you order frequently, it’s definitely worth it.Audible is Amazon’s audiobook arm, where members get one book credit for $14.95 per month, which is often less than the cost of the book otherwise, and is redeemable for literally anything in the Audible database. Or, for $7.95 per month, listeners get access to a more limited selection of books, plus podcasts, sleep tracks and meditation tracks. Audible also often offers a three-credits discount, bringing the cost down to more like $11-$12 per credit, as well as other sales and discounts periodically throughout the year and offers a 30-day free trial.Competitor Scribd gives Audible a run for its money, and is available on all the same Apple or Android devices with a 30-day free trial. Scribd’s subscription is $11.99 per month, but rather than giving you only one credit, subscribers have unlimited access to the app’s wide database of books, magazines, podcasts and sheet music. The problem is that many bestsellers will take a while to become available, long after they are up on Audible. So as for which is better, it depends on how you’re using your service — to get the latest and greatest new releases, or to be open to books (as well as magazines and podcasts) of all kinds.Finally, there’s Libby, a free app that makes audiobooks, podcasts and music available to listeners by connecting them with local libraries through a system called Overdrive. Libraries that have Overdrive can allow library members to access audiobooks for free. But libraries are also only allowed a certain number of licenses for each book, and thus wait times can run long. But you can’t get any better than free!Ultimately, Audible is not the cheapest or likely the best option among audiobooks out there.Amazon touts its Kindle Unlimited (KU) plan as a great deal, because you can borrow up to 20 KU titles at a time, plus magazines. Because Kindle is available as a free app, you also don’t need to own a Kindle device, but can access it on any smart device such as a phone, tablet or even by computer.It sounds like an excellent deal, but according to MakeUseOf, there’s one big catch: None of the books available on KU are published by the big publishing houses. Its millions of titles are mostly self-published books, and a few items of classic literature. There’s nothing wrong with self-publishing, except that many of these books don’t go through the editing or vetting process that traditional publishing requires, meaning that you might find as many duds as you do gems.MakeUseOf also points out that many self-published books sell for very little already, some as little as 99 cents, thus you’d have to read quite a lot of KU books to make the $9.99 per month fee worth it. This is one area where the service is probably not worth the money, and you’d be better off using either Audible, Scribd or the Overdrive/Libby app through your local library.More From GOBankingRatesWhy Stealth Wealth Is the Best Way To Handle Your MoneyGot a Question About Money?

AMZN,Uber: Driving Growth With Logistics Software,"Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) recently reported first-quarter 2023 earnings results that have changed the prevailing narrative surrounding the company and have been well-received by investors. This year, the stock has seen stellar growth compared to the market, establishing it as one of the best-performing stocks in the tech industry.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with UBER. Click here to check it out. UBER 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of UBERPeter Lynch Chart of UBERUber was once considered just a ride-hailing service, but it soon built out its tech ventures, and now it's evolving into a logistics software company that uses its technology to enter new business lines. Uber's subscription service, Uber One, already has 12 million subscribers and offers numerous benefits for businesses. Let's take a closer look at why Uber is thriving, and why I expect it to continue doing so for the foreseeable future.An evolving business modelFollowing in the footsteps of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Uber is at its core a tech-driven logistics business that leverages software to transport physical assets (and people in Uber's case). It doesn't own the physical assets it controls, such as cars or drivers, but rather uses algorithms to control them, making it a ""pure software"" company. This allows Uber to pivot and scale its business model to new ventures easily.Uber's recent results have shifted the prevailing narrative, with the company delivering impressive free cash flows, strong revenue growth rates and record profitability.Although the stock is not cheap considering its low level of profitability, I am encouraged by the recent turnaround of the underlying business. The company's gross bookings for the second quarter point to steady growth, which could lead to strong revenue growth rates in 2023. Moreover, Uber's significant improvement in Ebitda profitability and free cash flow generation in the first quarter suggests that it is a growth business delivering solid free cash flows.The subscription model is a gamechangerUber One has revolutionized the ride-hailing experience, similar to how Amazon Prime revolutionized online shopping. Uber One is a subscription package that offers numerous advantages to its customers. This program has been designed to make it easier and more convenient for users to use Uber services. For $24.99 per month, Uber One members get 10% off rides, free deliveries on Uber Eats, priority airport pickups and more.The service's success has been indisputable, boasting 12 million users signing up already. One of the economic benefits of Uber One is improved consumer retention. With the subscription model, users are likelier to continue using Uber's services since they feel they have already paid for them. This also translates to higher spending per user, as subscribers are incentivized to use the service more often to get the most out of their subscriptions.Another benefit of Uber One is the smooth revenue stream it provides for the company. Since subscribers pay a monthly fee, it gives Uber a more predictable and consistent revenue stream compared to the volatile nature of ride-hailing revenue. This helps the company better plan for the future and invest in new business lines. Overall, Uber One should be a significant driver of results for Uber and has the potential to cement its position in the market further.Talking about the valuationUber's first-quarter earnings surpassed Wall Street estimates, leading to a 10% surge in its stock price. Despite management's confidence in improving profitability in the second quarter and achieving its adjusted Ebitda projections of $5 billion by the fiscal year 2024, I would still suggest investors exercise caution.I believe investors who missed buying the stock at lower levels should be wary of joining the momentum surge for its earnings release because it may not last. Despite posting strong earnings, there are potential macroeconomic risks that could intensify.TakeawayUber's business is more complex than it seems, with a diversified and fast-growing revenue stream aided by its logistics software core competency. Its new subscription service, Uber One, is driving growth and increasing user retention.Overall, it seems Uber is putting the pieces together for a spectacular business model, one that is lean and focused on growth. Considering these aspects, I think several years of extraordinary growth could be in store for the company. The company's ability to innovate and diversify its business, coupled with its logistics software core competency, makes it an attractive investment opportunity for the long term in my view. The market may not necessarily realize that now, which is understandable for a variety of reasons, but it is definitely one for the watch list.","May 5, 2023 at 2:42 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/uber-driving-growth-logistics-software-194209959.html,GuruFocus.com,0.0,0.0,0.18765460729746444,0.4702999381570809
AMZN,15 of Your Favorite Companies That Have Gone Out of Business,"And instead of shopping at specialty stores, Target, Walmart and Amazon have become the go-to for buying just about everything. With the changing consumer landscape, some of our formerly favorite companies have gone out of business in recent years.If you're ready for some retail nostalgia, take a look at some once-beloved stores and companies that don't really exist anymore.In a pre-e-reader, pre-Amazon world, browsing books at Borders was an idyllic way to spend an afternoon. The mega-bookstore started out with a single location in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and expanded to hundreds of locations throughout the U.S. during its 40-year run. Borders' focus on size may have been its downfall, however, NPR reported -- the chain continued to emphasize stocking a wide variety of books in-store even as online shopping continued to rise in popularity. The company was no longer profitable after 2006 and closed its doors for good in 2011.Kodak began with the mission to make photography more accessible to the masses -- and back when physical film was a thing, nothing could beat the excitement of seeing how all of your pictures turned out (or the disappointment about the ones that didn't). But as photography went digital, the company went into decline; it filed for bankruptcy in 2012.In the years since the filing, Kodak has pivoted its focus from cameras to a number of other products, including cellphones, tablets, a digital currency called KodakCoin and commercial printing software. Its latest pivot is even more unexpected -- in August, Kodak agreed to a deal for a $765 million government loan to produce ingredients used to make generic drugs, The Wall Street Journal reported.If you grew up in the '90s, you likely spent many a Friday night searching for the perfect movie at your local Blockbuster. The first Blockbuster video-rental store opened in Dallas in 1985, a time when most video stores offered just a limited selection of titles. With 8,000 tapes to choose from, Blockbuster quickly became a success and the company expanded rapidly. It eventually became one of the biggest in-home entertainment companies in the world, according to History. Then, digital video came into the picture, and Blockbuster struggled to compete, eventually closing its stores for good in 2013 following its acquisition by Dish in 2011, The New York Times reported. However, this decision did not affect locations that are independently owned. Although most franchises have since closed their stores, one location still remains in Bend, Oregon -- and it may be worth the trip to get your nostalgia fix. Just don't forget to rewind.Sports Authority was founded in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, in 1987 and grew to become the largest sporting goods store chain in the country with stores in 41 states and Puerto Rico, The Chicago Tribune reported. In 1990 it was acquired by Kmart, and in 2006, the company was bought by a private equity firm. Facing tough competition from Dick's Sporting Goods and Amazon, Sports Authority filed for bankruptcy in 2016. The company hoped to be able to keep some stores open, but after failing to secure a buyer, it closed its doors for good.The first RadioShack dates back to 1921 with a ham radio shop in Boston, according to the trade magazine Twice. Through the years, it evolved into the go-to spot for loudspeakers, mobile phones, satellite TVs, batteries and electronic toys, and it was the first retailer to sell a mass-marketed, fully-assembled PC. But with the rise of Best Buy and Amazon, RadioShack was soon left in the dust. The company filed for bankruptcy in 2015, was acquired by Sprint, and filed for bankruptcy again in 2017. Following its second bankruptcy, RadioShack started a new partnership with Hobby Lobby to bring RadioShack Express ""stores"" inside 100 HobbyTown locations, CNBC reported.A popular purveyor of rhinestone logo T-shirts and sweatpants, Bebe was a mall staple for many years. The women's retail store was founded by Iranian-born immigrant Manny Mashouf in 1976, who took the company public in 1998. He and his family were briefly billionaires in 2006 at the peak of the company's success, Forbes reported. But following years of declining sales and losses, Bebe decided to close all of its stores in 2017. The brand has since transitioned to an online-only retailer.Once lauded for its super-soft, somewhat-overpriced T-shirts and hoodies, American Apparel eventually got swept up in scandals involving its labor practices and allegations of sexual harassment, leading to its downfall. But before all that, the retailer began out of founder Dov Charney's dorm room in 1989. American Apparel went on to expand to over 200 stores in over 20 countries, reaching $633 million in sales, The Atlantic reported. But the scandals, Charney's ousting for those scandals and a changing retail landscape all added up to American Apparel's demise. It declared bankruptcy in 2015 and again in 2016, and was acquired by Canadian company Gildan Activewear in 2017, CNBC reported. While you can no longer browse identical basics in every color of the rainbow at an American Apparel store, you can still purchase the brand online.Toys R Us started as a baby goods store in 1948 and evolved into the first-ever big-box toy store in 1957. Originally created as a ""supermarket for toys,"" this new model transformed toy shopping from a once-a-year holiday treat to a regular family outing. The idea quickly caught on, and Toys R Us ended up going public in 1978. Business boomed in the '80s and '90s, but, ironically, Toys R Us was defeated by the big-box model it had pioneered, with stores like Walmart proving to be a tough competitor in the space. The rise of e-commerce and Amazon further hurt Toys R Us' bottom line, and the company eventually decided to close all of its U.S. stores in 2018 after declaring bankruptcy, CNN reported.In 2019, much to the delight of anyone who once considered themselves a Toys R Us kid, the beloved toy chain reemerged -- but on a much smaller scale. It now operates two mall stores: one in Houston and one in Paramus, New Jersey.Payless ShoeSource was once the go-to shopping destination for inexpensive footwear -- by 2011, its sales volume had reached $3.4 billion, Forbes reported. The shoe retailer started from humble beginnings, with a single store called Volume Shoe Corp. It was incorporated as a part of The May Department stores in 1979 and became its own independent company once again in 1996. Roughly two decades later, Payless filed for bankruptcy in 2017 following increasing debts from an overly aggressive expansion plan. In 2019, Payless filed for bankruptcy a second time and closed all of its stores.According to Forbes, ""the company continued to encounter too many aggressive competitors, including Zappos (a division of Amazon), Kohl's, Walmart, Target and others who provided more compelling merchandise offerings. A visit to a Payless store became irrelevant.""However, Payless reopened under new management in August 2020, and has since opened its first re-designed brick-and-mortar store in Miami.In 1976, Gymboree was founded as a play and music center for kids; it wasn't until a decade later that it began selling children's clothes, Retail Dive reported. In 2010, the company was bought by Bain Capital for $1.8 billion; at the time, Gymboree was rapidly expanding and carried almost no debt. Sadly, things took a turn for the worse and the company filed for bankruptcy in 2017 and again in 2019. Following its second bankruptcy filing, Gymboree was acquired by its competitor, The Children's Place, CNBC reported.Although Gymboree no longer has stand-alone stores, it's now available to shop online as well as in shop-in-shop locations in select The Children's Place stores.The original Dressbarn was founded in 1962 by Roslyn Jaffe, a mother of three, in Stamford, Connecticut. It was acquired by Ascena Retail Group in 2011, and in 2019, the company's chief executive announced that Dressbarn would be closing all of its stores.""This decision was difficult, but necessary, as the Dressbarn chain has not been operating at an acceptable level of profitability in today's retail environment,"" Steven Taylor, chief financial officer of Dressbarn, said in a statement at the time.Dressbarn had been struggling to maintain customers who were flocking to competitor stores like TJ Maxx, Target and Walmart, The New York Times reported. Although it no longer has physical locations, you can now shop the retailer at Dressbarn.com.Papyrus dates back to 1950 when it sold cards and imported stationery wholesale, and it expanded into retail stores in 1973. It eventually grew to 500 stores, including its American Greetings, Carlton Cards and Paper Destiny brands, CNN reported. The company never fully recovered from the 2008 financial crisis due to overexpansion and a decline in brick-and-mortar shopping. Although Papyrus stores are closed, you can still shop Papyrus-branded cards at other stores.Pier 1 Imports began as a single store in San Mateo, California, in 1962, and in 1979, its Royal Oak, Michigan, location became the first to reach $1 million in annual sales. Pier 1 launched its online e-commerce site in 2012 -- but it seems like this move was too little too late. In June 2020, Pier 1 officially went out of business and announced that it would be closing all of its stores by October, CNN reported. Sales had been declining as big-box stores like Target and Walmart expanded their home goods offerings.Pier 1 has now been acquired by Retail Ecommerce Ventures and it has been relaunched as an ""internet-first retailer.""Sam Stein, a Russian immigrant, opened the original Stein Mart as a general merchandise store in Greenville, Mississippi, in 1908, and through its evolution into a department store, it remained in the family until the company filed for bankruptcy in 2020, the Jacksonville Daily Record reported. The department store chain was already struggling due to a shift from brick-and-mortar retail to e-commerce, and pandemic-related closures proved to be the straw that broke the camel's back. In August, Stein Mart's liquidators announced that it would be closing all of its 279 locations, CNBC reported.The original Barneys was a 500-square-foot men's discount store in New York City founded by Barney Pressman in 1923. When his son Fred inherited the business, he turned it into a luxury retailer. In 2019, it was sold to Authentic Brands Group and financial firm B. Riley for $271.4 million, and a year later, the company closed its stores for good. Authentic Brands said that it will license the Barneys New York name to Saks Fifth Avenue, with plans to bring Barneys New York shops to various Saks stores in key markets in the U.S. and Canada, NBC New York reported.More From GOBankingRates5 Expensive Renovations Homeowners Always RegretFinancial Insight in Your Inbox: Sign Up for GBR's Daily Newsletter3 Ways to Recession Proof Your Retirement7 Things You Must Do To Create a Plan for Your Money","May 5, 2023 at 1:00 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-favorite-companies-gone-business-170039171.html,GOBankingRates,0.5,1.0,0.10481111005008069,0.3625157318172025

AMZN,"Walmart keeps grocery prices steady amid inflation, antitrust claims","By Siddharth CavaleNEW YORK (Reuters) - A new analysis of Walmart's pricing strategy reveals it has consistently kept grocery prices lower than competitors while generally hiking prices at rates far below U.S. inflation, even while the firm now faces allegations of using its clout to gain unfair advantages over rivals.Data analytics firm Dataweave compared the prices of 589 name-brand products in 34 categories, including coffee, soup, cereals, baking goods, batteries, personal care items and pet food exclusively for Reuters.The firm pulled and examined prices at both store and online properties of Walmart, Kroger, Target and Amazon, for the items every day to arrive at one average price for each month between January 2022 and the end of February 2023.During the period, while U.S. inflation averaged 7.5% Walmart kept prices steady, the Dataweave analysis shows.Walmart stores and Walmart.com merchandise rose, on average, 3% in price overall in the 14 months through February 2023, compared to a 7.5% increase for the same products sold at Amazon and 9% at Kroger and Target, said Krishnan Thyagarajan, chief operating officer at Dataweave.Walmart reported net profits of $11.3 billion for its year ended Jan. 31, 2023, a 19% drop compared to last year, mainly due to restructuring charges related to its exit from the UK and Japan and a $3.3 billion opioid settlement.

AMZN,7 Items That Are Always Cheaper on Amazon,"However, shopping on Amazon can also be a boon to your budget -- especially if you know which items are always cheaper with the online retailer. Before you add the following items to your Walmart, Target or grocery store shopping list, check out their prices on Amazon and compare. You might be surprised at how much you can save.For example, you can find a wide variety of durable, yet plush, squeaker toys for your dog who's an aggressive chewer for $7 or less. However, if you check at PetSmart, you'll only find a handful of toys that go for the same price including what's on sale.Some parents don't have the option of buying whatever brand of baby wipe is on sale due to their little one's sensitive skin. On Amazon, however, there's a good chance you can get the wipe you want (or something similar) and save.And if you want to really stock up and save even more, opt for a 150-count box of Amazon Basics Woodcased No. 2 Pencils that are pre-sharpened for $14.05, which is just 9 cents per pencil.She added, ""Elsewhere, retailers are charging as much as $10 for the same amount, although at least one is charging $5.66 for the same product. [However], the same store is also charging $4 for delivery, which means you're getting close to that $10 mark again by shopping there. Buying this tea for [$6.99] at Amazon is particularly a good move if you have a Prime membership or if you're placing a larger order, as you should be able to avoid extra delivery charges that way.""If you do a similar search on Walmart, you might be able to find a few options that can compete with Amazon's prices, but for a larger selection of cheaper pillow covers, check Amazon first.Note that different colors and patterns are often different prices, so if you're open to random colors and/or patterns, you can get a great deal. At Walmart, you'll pay at least $9.95 for two satin pillowcases, and at Target, you'll pay $5 each.More From GOBankingRates5 Expensive Renovations Homeowners Always RegretFinancial Insight in Your Inbox: Sign Up for GBR's Daily Newsletter3 Ways to Recession Proof Your Retirement7 Things You Must Do To Create a Plan for Your MoneyDisclaimer: Photos are for representational purposes only, and prices may vary based on time, location and availability.","May 5, 2023 at 11:00 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-items-always-cheaper-amazon-110115908.html,GOBankingRates,0.0,0.0,0.057319819819819824,0.45247747747747746

AMZN,ZLNDY vs. AMZN: Which Stock Is the Better Value Option?,"Investors interested in Internet - Commerce stocks are likely familiar with Zalando (ZLNDY) and Amazon (AMZN). But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors? We'll need to take a closer look to find out.The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.Zalando and Amazon are both sporting a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy) right now. The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that both of these companies have improving earnings outlooks. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.ZLNDY currently has a forward P/E ratio of 51.34, while AMZN has a forward P/E of 67.38. We also note that ZLNDY has a PEG ratio of 2.74. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. AMZN currently has a PEG ratio of 3.67.Another notable valuation metric for ZLNDY is its P/B ratio of 4.52. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, AMZN has a P/B of 6.91.These metrics, and several others, help ZLNDY earn a Value grade of B, while AMZN has been given a Value grade of C.Both ZLNDY and AMZN are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks, but based on these valuation figures, we feel that ZLNDY is the superior value option right now.Zalando (ZLNDY) : Free Stock Analysis ReportAmazon.com, Inc.

AMZN,5 Attractive Large-Cap Stocks to Buy Despite Recession Fears,"Wall Street has been suffering from volatility again since the beginning of May. In its recently concluded May FOMC meeting, the Fed raised the benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to the range of 5-5.25%, marking the highest Fed Fund rate since August 2007.Fed Chairman Jerome Powell indicated that the ongoing rate hike cycle is perhaps reaching its end, although it will depend on the outcome of economic data. However, Powell has categorically denied any rate cut this year as inflation seems to be declining at a slow rate.As a result, the U.S. economy is suffering its biggest challenge in the regional banking segment. Three major regional banks have already collapsed and a large-section of economists and financial experts remain highly concerned about more casualties.In first-quarter 2023, the U.S. GDP growth rate came in at a moderate 1.1% compared with the consensus estimate of 2% and the fourth-quarter 2022 growth rate of 2.6%. Moreover, the Conference Board’s Leading Economic Index, a gauge of future economic activity, dropped to 108.4 in March from February’s revised reading of 109.7, its 12th successive monthly drop and the lowest reading since November 2020.Precipitous contraction in ISM manufacturing and services activities, a decline in orders of durable goods, a reduction in construction activities, and a freight recession are all signaling the possibility of a recession later this year. Fed Chair also acknowledged that the current banking turmoil in the United States has led to tighter credit conditions, and is likely to impact economic activities.Consequently, several large-cap stocks are currently available at attractive valuations.

Some of their ""Endulge"" and protein meal bars qualify as food on Amazon, and you can purchase such delicious flavors as strawberry cheesecake, nutty fudge brownie and vanilla pecan crisp. Not all their bars are SNAP eligible, so be sure to double-check.Technically, Chia seeds are edible, even if most of the other items in a Chia Pet (namely a clay figurine into which you plant the seeds) are not. And while not all Chia Pets are SNAP eligible, the Chia Pet Trolls version is, and it's a fun project for kids to grow.Though you can't purchase an actual cup of hot coffee with EBT, Keurig owners rejoice -- you can purchase Keurig coffee pods at Amazon with your EBT. And the online retailer has a deal on a 40 coffee pod sampler for $22.95 -- more than a month's worth of daily coffee for less than $1 per pod.Another way Amazon plays with a gray area around SNAP-eligible items is when a game includes food.

Fortunately, you can purchase energy drinks like Monster with your EBT at Amazon.In case of emergencies, disaster experts recommend you have as much as a week's worth of food stored in case you can't leave your home. Amazon sells an Augason Farms lunch and dinner 4-gallon pail emergency food supply that you can purchase with EBT.Some of the decorative elements you need to make a cake, cookies or cupcakes are sometimes SNAP eligible on Amazon; for example, Wilton sugar pearls.According to the USDA, some gift baskets are SNAP eligible, so long as 50% of the items are food-based.

Some that are SNAP eligible include Cadet gourmet beef hide and chicken twists.Depending on the way a protein powder is classified -- as a food versus a supplement -- they can be purchased with EBT.

AMZN,"37 Mistakes We Make When Shopping at Costco, Amazon, Target and Walmart","Costco is a bulk-buyer's paradise -- but not everything there is a good deal. Don't make these mistakes when you shop at the warehouse store.You're sure to overspend when you go to Costco without a plan for what to buy.You might equate bulk buying with getting a good deal, but this isn't necessarily the case.""Buying in bulk can be a great deal if you will use or consume the items purchased, but it can also make a dent in your wallet and/or trash can if you don't use them,"" Gramuglia said. ""Before you buy, it's important to analyze the cost per unit to see if it is worth buying the larger option.""""If you see an item that you want to try but it's in bulk, hold off on purchasing it,"" Gramuglia said. ""You're better off buying a single unit at your regular grocery store to see if you actually like the product before overspending on a larger quantity of something you may end up tossing in the garbage.""""Knock a few extra dollars off of your choice of membership by shopping through TopCashback.com,"" Gramuglia said. ""You can score $3 cash back on a Gold Star Membership purchase and $6 cash back on the Executive Membership purchase.""If an item you bought goes on sale within 30 days of your purchase, you can get the difference back as a price adjustment. Not taking advantage of this policy is basically throwing money away.Costco sells gift cards at a discount, so it's worth it to purchase them for yourself for restaurants and retailers that you frequent. You're automatically saving when you shop or dine with the discounted gift card.You already know that Costco has some of the lowest prices on electronics, but you might not know that your tech purchases give you free access to the superstore's Concierge Service. Costco offers free technical support for members, as well as a two-year warranty on many electronics purchases.Don't overlook Kirkland Signature items. For many products, Costco's store brand is comparable to its name-brand counterpart.You may not realize it, but there's a lot of information about a product hidden in its price sign. Uproxx reports that the following prices and symbols have specific meanings:Prices ending in .99 or .98: These products are retail price, and don't provide savings over other store's prices unless bought in bulk.Prices ending in .89, .79, .69, .59, .49, .39, .29, .19 or .09: These are manufacturer deals, so you're getting a lower price than you would elsewhere.Prices ending in .97: These are items that are on sale because the store manager needs to move stock.Prices ending in .88 or .00: This indicates a steeply discounted product.Asterisk: Price signs marked with an asterisk in the top right corner indicate that it's heavily discounted and will be discontinued, so now is the time to stock up.There are some Costo perks even nonmembers can take advantage of. This includes filling prescriptions at the pharmacy, which often has lower prices for drugs than elsewhere, CNBC reported. Nonmembers can also get flu shots and eye exams at Costco, purchase food at the food court and -- in certain states -- buy alcohol at Costco's low prices.If there's something you want or need, there's a good chance you can find it on Amazon. However, you might be paying too much for your purchases if you're making any of these online shopping errors.""It's really easy to see something you like and purchase it on the spot -- especially when Amazon makes checking out very convenient -- but what if you knew it went on sale less than a month later?"" Gramuglia said. ""Seasonal items usually get marked down around the same time every year and sale events like Amazon's Prime Day have similar items discounted every year. Typically, on Prime Day, you can expect prices to be at their lowest amount, even beating Black Friday on popular items from beauty, tech, home, kitchen and virtually every other category you can think of.""Gramuglia notes that although Prime Day traditionally takes place during the first few weeks of July, there are reports that it may be moved to September this year.You're missing out on a substantial discount on items you buy often if you don't use this feature.""With Amazon's Subscribe & Save, you can save time and money on everyday items,"" Gramulgia said. ""From detergent to toilet paper, you can subscribe to receive shipments of the items you need on a regular basis for less. And for every five or more products in one auto-delivery, you can get as much as 15% or 20% off if you're a Prime member on subscriptions to diapers, baby food and more.""""If you're an Amazon Prime member and don't need your order right away, consider choosing free no-rush shipping instead of free two-day shipping to earn rewards on future Amazon purchases,"" Gramulgia said. ""This is a great way to save money in the long run.""""The Amazon Rewards Visa Signature Card or Amazon Prime Rewards Visa Signature Card is a must-have for any Amazon shopper,"" Gramuglia said. ""For every eligible purchase you make with an Amazon Rewards Visa Signature Card, you earn 3% back -- or 5% back if you're a Prime member with the Prime Rewards card -- at Amazon.com and Whole Foods; 2% back at restaurants, gas stations and drugstores; and 1% back everywhere else.""You can find Amazon's best deals and steals for new products in the ""Today's Deals"" link at the top of any Amazon page.""There you'll be able to shop Amazon's Deal of the Day and Lightning Deals -- the latter is when you only get hours or just minutes to purchase a product on sale,"" Gramuglia said. ""This added browsing can score you more savings than you expect at Amazon.""Although it may be convenient to buy everything on Amazon, it doesn't always have the best prices.""There are plenty of other online retailers that can give you a better price and discount,"" Gramuglia said. ""Before you check out, browse other major online retailers and compare prices to ensure you're really getting the best deal.""Amazon will sometimes have different prices for the same item in different colors based on the supply and demand for each color, CNBC reported. If the color doesn't matter to you, click through the different options to find the lowest price.When you search for an item on Amazon, you don't always see the best price for it on the main product page. On the right column of the product page, you will see a list of ""other sellers on Amazon"" and the prices they are selling the item for. In some cases, there are lower prices available.Applying coupons on Amazon is as easy as checking a box underneath where the item price is listed -- but if you don't look out for it, you could miss it and miss out on the savings.Prices on Amazon fluctuate often, so it's worth checking a price tracking site like CamelCamelCamel.com to see if the current price for an item you want is high or low. If you're not in a rush to buy it, you can set an alert that will let you know when the price has dropped.With great quality items at fair prices, it's hard not to love shopping at Target. But you could be spending too much money at the beloved retailer if you're making any of these mistakes.""If you love a bargain and receiving rewards simply for the shopping you would've done anyway, consider opening a credit card -- or even a debit card -- at Target,"" Gramuglia said. ""The Target RedCard gives users a 5% discount on all purchases, free shipping online and access to RedCard Exclusives including special items, gifts and promotions.""You can even save 5% at any in-store Starbucks location when you use your RedCard, Gramuglia said.""If you haven't already, download the Target app to gain exclusive access to deals and coupons, browse weekly ads and place orders with Drive Up,"" Gramuglia said. ""It's easier than ever to use coupons to save money and time when shopping through the Target app.""You can sometimes save money by abandoning your online shopping cart.""Stores like Target track our every move while browsing the internet, so when we leave a store's page without making a purchase, they take note of it,"" Gramuglia said. ""If you wait a few days or so, you may receive a 'We miss you!' or 'You forgot something!' email from that store featuring a product you clicked on but didn't buy, and sometimes a customized discount code, too.""There's no one clearance section at Target, so it's important to not overlook the clearance areas in the respective sections of the store.""Target scatters their deals and steals throughout the store,"" Gramuglia said. ""And don't ignore the endcaps! You can find some serious savings there.""As with Amazon, you may be tempted to purchase everything you need during a single Target shopping trip -- but Target doesn't always have the lowest prices.""You can likely save money simply by comparing your options,"" Gramuglia said. ""Before you purchase an item, check to see if the price is lower at another store, or if another store is having a sale.""As is the case with Costco, you should never go to Target without a shopping list.""Target is one of those stores that's really easy to walk out of with more than you intended -- there's even a term for it: the 'Target Effect,'"" Ramhold said. ""A good way to combat this is to plan your trips in minute detail. It sounds overwhelming, but the app can make things much easier as it has a map function so you can pinpoint where the items on your list are. Make your list in the app, note where each item is, and then stick to that list to keep from walking out with five new throw pillows you don't have room for.""Not everything on the Target app and site is available for in-store pickup, but if you only need a few things and they are available for pickup or drive up, consider using this functionality.""If you opt for store pickup, you'll go inside and go straight to the service desk to pick up your order when it's ready, and if you opt for drive-up service, they'll bring your order out to you,"" Ramhold said. ""This means you won't even have a chance to be enticed by the cute and useful things in the Dollar Spot, or the selection of snacks up front.""Walmart is known for its 'everyday low prices' -- but you still might be spending more than you need to be if you're making these common Walmart shopping mistakes.Like Amazon, Walmart.com sells items from third-party sellers.""Before you buy something on Walmart.com, do a Google search to see if you are getting the lowest price,"" Gramuglia said. ""For example, a pair of Nike sneakers from a third-party seller on Walmart ranges from $89.22 to $98.52, whereas you can buy the exact same shoe at Dick's Sporting Goods for $54.99. Keep in mind that Walmart does not price match for third-party sellers, so comparing prices prior to purchasing is a must.""""Walmart is known for its prices, but whether you are shopping something full-price or on sale at a Rollback price, be sure to always comparison shop to make sure you're actually getting the best deal,"" Gramuglia said. ""Walmart does price-match, but it needs to be the exact item and must apply to other limitations the store sets.""You should also take quality into consideration before making a purchase.""If you find yourself eyeing a product, like a sweater for $10, consider the quality, style, and longevity and usage of the product,"" Gramuglia said. ""Sometimes inexpensive products end up costing you more in replacing the item than it would if you bought a better quality product. However, you can also find quality products at a lower price, so be sure to weigh the pros and cons to make the best decision for your finances.""""You may find a clearance item or full-priced item that you've been eyeing, but may want to put it back on the shelf because it's out of your budget. But before you do that, double-check the price,"" Gramuglia said. ""Especially since items can be easily moved throughout the large store, always price check your items for a final verdict. Stores like Walmart are constantly running promotions and have items marked down, and may be running a deal that you don't know about that can save you an extra few bucks. The price scanner will give you the most up-to-date cost.""The early bird gets the best deals at Walmart.""Walmart has 'Great Value' options that are branded replacements; [opting for these] can help you save hundreds every month,"" Kuka said. ""In most cases, the brand is nothing but a name in comparison.""""Usually a month before the next major holiday rolls around, Walmart devotes at least one entire aisle to items for it. And yes, it can be tempting to grab a giant bag of Halloween-themed chocolate in mid-September, but if you wait until the day after the holiday, you'll see incredible discounts that make it so much easier to get a bigger bang for your buck,"" Ramhold said. ""Granted, for things like that, you might need themed candies and items before the holiday itself, but we recommend getting only what you need ahead of time, and then treating yourself to goodies the day after the holiday.""""Rollback prices typically last around 90 days, but they aren't actually sale or clearance prices -- they're just a slight price drop due to something like overstock,"" Ramhold said.More From GOBankingRates10 Aldi Brand Products Worth BuyingLearn To Master Your Money With These Financial Tips3 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000Financial Insight in Your Inbox: Sign Up for GBR's Daily Newsletter","May 4, 2023 at 2:00 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/37-mistakes-shopping-costco-amazon-143207271.html,GOBankingRates,0.0,0.0,0.1900595736369217,0.4261475081088338

AMZN,"Shopify Cuts Jobs Again, Sells Most of Logistics Business to Flexport","(Bloomberg) -- Shopify Inc. is cutting jobs for the second time in 10 months and selling the majority of its logistics business to Flexport Inc. to focus on its core e-commerce platform business.Most Read from BloombergChina Takes the Yuan Global in Bid to Repel a Weaponized DollarTD, First Horizon End $13 Billion Merger as Regulators StallZelenskiy Denies Ukraine Sent Drones to Hit Putin, KremlinBank Drama Rages On; Apple Climbs in Late Trading: Markets WrapPeter Thiel Says Moving to Florida from Silicon Valley Is Too ExpensiveThe moves mean the company will shrink by more than 2,000 people. “I don’t want to bury the lede: after today Shopify will be smaller by about 20% and Flexport will buy Shopify Logistics; this means some of you will leave Shopify today,” Chief Executive Officer Tobi Lütke said in a memo to staff. “I recognize the crushing impact this decision has on some of you, and did not make this decision lightly.”Shopify soared about 27% to C$79.76 as of 10:35 a.m. in Toronto, the biggest intraday rise since 2015.The company expects to incur severance charges of $140 million to $150 million. “Our numbers were unhealthy, just like it is in much of the tech industry,” Lütke said. “With the right numbers we’ll fully focus on outcomes and impact.” During a conference call, executives said Shopify has to operate with greater speed and is moving quickly toward its ideal size.The logistics deal is a big change for the Canadian e-commerce giant, reversing a strategy it had implemented to better compete with Amazon.com Inc. Flexport will acquire most of its fulfillment assets including those of shipping startup Deliverr Inc., which Shopify bought just last year for $2.1 billion.“We applaud management for making difficult decisions that set the company up better for long-term success, although this is significant pivot,” Baird analyst Colin Sebastian wrote in a note to clients.Revenue for the period came in at $1.51 billion, beating the $1.43 billion average estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Gross merchandise volume, the total value of merchant sales across Shopify’s platforms, was $49.6 billion, above Wall Street projections of $47.7 billion.Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Anurag Rana:“Shopify divesting its logistics business is a good strategic move, especially as Amazon.com pushes its ‘Buy with Prime’ program for non-Amazon sellers. This strategy shift, while painful in the short-term due to write-downs and layoffs, will increase the company’s focus on selling more products through its platform. Separately, 1Q results were surprisingly strong with sales 640 bps higher than consensus.”The Ottawa-based company also gave an outlook for the second quarter, saying it expects revenue to grow at a similar rate to the first quarter growth rate on a year-over-year basis. It also expects to achieve free cash flow profitability for each quarter of 2023.Shopify bet early in the pandemic that a rapid rise in online shopping, fueled by customers staying home, would become permanent. As that wager soured, Lütke has been forced to retrench. The company cut about 1,000 jobs last summer, raised prices and focused on building out client offerings and its in-house fulfillment network. Shopify had 11,600 employees at the end of 2022.The company has had to contend with macroeconomic risks, including slower consumer spending and inflationary pressures. Retail sales fell 1.4% in March, according to a preliminary Statistics Canada estimate.(Updates with more details throughout, analyst comment, share price)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekHow a Dishwasher Engineer Challenged Elon Musk’s Grip on Commercial SpaceTwitter’s Unpaid Bills Threaten to Be an Even Bigger Problem for Elon MuskToo Big to Fail, But Not Too Big to Bail Out Other BanksThe Company Behind Ben Shapiro Is Trying to Build a Right-Wing Magic KingdomCadillac’s Lyriq EV Might Be a Winner If GM Can Build Enough of Them©2023 Bloomberg L.P.","May 4, 2023 at 9:41 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/shopify-cuts-jobs-again-sells-144116035.html,Bloomberg,0.5,0.5,0.0920887445887446,0.4660281385281385
AMZN,How Much Upside is Left in Amazon (AMZN)? Wall Street Analysts Think 37.28%,"The mean estimate comprises 41 short-term price targets with a standard deviation of $27.50. While the lowest estimate of $106 indicates a 2.3% increase from the current price level, the most optimistic analyst expects the stock to surge 160.5% to reach $270. It's very important to note the standard deviation here, as it helps understand the variability of the estimates. The smaller the standard deviation, the greater the agreement among analysts.While the consensus price target is a much-coveted metric for investors, solely banking on this metric to make an investment decision may not be wise at all. That's because the ability and unbiasedness of analysts in setting price targets have long been questionable.But, for AMZN, an impressive average price target is not the only indicator of a potential upside. Strong agreement among analysts about the company's ability to report better earnings than they predicted earlier strengthens this view. While a positive trend in earnings estimate revisions doesn't gauge how much a stock could gain, it has proven to be powerful in predicting an upside.Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseHere's What You May Not Know About Analysts' Price TargetsAccording to researchers at several universities across the globe, a price target is one of many pieces of information about a stock that misleads investors far more often than it guides. In fact, empirical research shows that price targets set by several analysts, irrespective of the extent of agreement, rarely indicate where the price of a stock could actually be heading.While Wall Street analysts have deep knowledge of a company's fundamentals and the sensitivity of its business to economic and industry issues, many of them tend to set overly optimistic price targets. Are you wondering why?They usually do that to drum up interest in shares of companies that their firms either have existing business relationships with or are looking to be associated with. In other words, business incentives of firms covering a stock often result in inflated price targets set by analysts.However, a tight clustering of price targets, which is represented by a low standard deviation, indicates that analysts have a high degree of agreement about the direction and magnitude of a stock's price movement. While that doesn't necessarily mean the stock will hit the average price target, it could be a good starting point for further research aimed at identifying the potential fundamental driving forces.That said, while investors should not entirely ignore price targets, making an investment decision solely based on them could lead to disappointing ROI. So, price targets should always be treated with a high degree of skepticism.Here's Why There Could be Plenty of Upside Left in AMZNAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason to expect an upside in the stock. That's because empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current year, nine estimates have moved higher over the last 30 days while two have gone lower. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased 15.2%.Moreover, AMZN currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on four factors related to earnings estimates. Given an impressive externally-audited track record, this is a more conclusive indication of the stock's potential upside in the near term. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>Therefore, while the consensus price target may not be a reliable indicator of how much AMZN could gain, the direction of price movement it implies does appear to be a good guide.Amazon.com, Inc.

AMZN,Apples earnings could buoy or sink Big Techs earnings season,"Wednesday, May 3, 2023“None of what's already been reported matters come Thursday night,” explained Deepwater Asset Management Managing Partner Gene Munster.“And the reason is ... because [of] the size of Apple, and also it's been relatively stable too. It's done a better job of enduring this versus other tech, so if there is a problem, you can throw out all the good news from Microsoft and Google and Meta,” Munster added.In turn, a solid result from Apple could help buoy the industry and drive up shares of other Big Tech names. But a miss could mean increased pressure on rival tech stocks, just as the sector looks to finally move past its COVID-induced hangover.Analysts expect Apple to report revenue of $92.6 billion for the second quarter, a 4.8% decline from the $97.3 billion Apple brought in during the same quarter last year. That's about in line with the 5% decline Apple posted in Q1.“We believe the broader tech industry is all on pins and needles waiting for Apple's results as many of the tech haters continue to yell fire in a crowded theater around softening demand, with Apple the best barometer globally of this metric,” Wedbush Managing Director Dan Ives told Yahoo Finance via email.For investors tracking the S&P 500, a miss by Apple could have an outsized impact on their portfolios.While Apple’s enormous size and weight relative to market competitors gives its results added importance, the company’s performance is also a key indicator for consumer spending.“Most, if not all, iPhones are purchased for consumers. Macs, for the most part, are purchased for consumers and/or small, medium businesses,” explained UBS Managing Director David Vogt. “So it's really more of a bellwether or a barometer regarding high end consumer spending.”A miss on Apple’s revenue, especially for its iPhone business, would mean consumers are spending less and holding back on making large purchases. Worse still would be any signal that revenue will come in weaker than anticipated in Q3. That would signal that Apple anticipates customers will continue to hold back on spending their cash.It all comes down to Thursday night.

AMZN,40 Best Things To Buy at Walmart and Target,"Legos are consistently rated as one of the best deals at Walmart.""Having three kids who've all been into Legos at one time or another, I figured this one out a long time ago,"" said Kyle James of Rather-Be-Shopping.Both Walmart and Target have some of the hottest Lego products available. In many cases, however, ""smart shoppers have long been aware that Walmart typically beats Target and Toys R Us on price,"" said James.For example, the Lego Star Wars AT-AT, Lego City sets and Lego Super Heroes tend to be a tad cheaper at Walmart than Target. But remember: Target does price match Walmart.com, so you might be able to get the same toys at the same price at both retailers.Walmart and Target both provide great deals on back-to-school supplies. Walmart offers both low everyday prices as well as rollback prices, and Target has been known to offer buy-one-get-one 50 percent off on a variety of school supplies.""Although Staples and Office Depot/Office Max offer competitive prices on school supplies during July and August, Walmart and Target consistently offer lower prices on pens, pencils, crayons, paper and other school supplies all year long,"" said Kendal Perez former employee of CouponSherpa.com.""For example, Target offers college-ruled filler paper -- 175 sheets for 99 cents -- compared to Office Depot's store brand of college-ruled filler paper (150 sheets) for $2.01,"" she said.Both Walmart and Target have a good track record when it comes to low prices on toys, ""especially around the Black Friday/Christmas sales [when] Walmart rolls back prices on its toys, and the products are identical to what you'll get elsewhere,"" said Kerry Sherin who formerly worked at Offers.com.""Target is really good at predicting the hot toys for Christmas and pricing them lower than the competition,"" said James. ""They know once they get shoppers in the toy aisle, they're probably going to buy other stuff at full price. So, if your child asks for a popular, and thus hard-to-find toy this Christmas, be sure to check Target first.""Walmart and Target both stand out with affordable prices on brand-name laundry detergent.""Walmart and Target typically have better prices on laundry detergent compared to grocers and especially online retailers,"" said Perez. ""For example, a 100-ounce bottle of Tide Original Liquid Laundry detergent is currently on sale for $15.99 at my local King Soopers.""Tide Original Liquid Laundry Detergent costs $15.99 each on Target.com. Walmart sells the detergent for $15.94.Walmart and Target continually offer competitive prices on name-brand cleaning products, said Perez. Walmart prices often undercut the prices at local grocers, and ""Target is known to offer gift cards of $5 to $10 with cleaning product purchases,"" she added.Online retailers such as Amazon can't compete with Walmart and Target's prices on many cleaning products. For example, a 2-liter refill of Windex Glass Cleaner costs $6.98 from Walmart [and] $6.99 from Target.Similarly, Lysol toilet bowl cleaner two-packs are cheaper at Target than on Amazon. And although Amazon's Clorox disinfecting wipes just barely beat Target's price, Amazon is one of the online retailers covered in Target's price-match policy.Multiple deals experts have cited both Walmart and Target prices on baby supplies and products. For example, Walmart shines when it comes to affordable baby supplies. Name-brand baby products such as the Graco Pack 'n Play with Automatic Folding Feet Playard costs only $97.99.""Walmart and Target offer better prices on bakeware and other cooking tools compared to grocery stores and online retailers,"" said Perez. For instance, a Pyrex Grip Rite 9.5-inch clear Glass Pie Pan is priced at $15.49 on Amazon compared to $5.49 at Target.Walmart offers affordable prices on Pyrex bakeware as well -- but Amazon has the retailer beat on some products, including the Pyrex Easy-Grab 9.5-inch Pie Plate two-pack. Fortunately, Walmart.com's price-match policy covers Amazon.com.Walmart and Target prices on Kleenex tissues tend to beat local stores. Compared to major pharmacies, Target has Walgreens beat on six-pack Kleenex bundles. Walmart also offers better prices on Kleenex bundle packs than Walgreens.Like tissues, toilet paper prices tend to be lower at Walmart and Target versus other retailers, said Brent Shelton of FatWallet. For example, Charmin Ultra Soft, Mega Roll 12-count packs at Walmart and Target are cheaper than on Amazon.com.Around Christmas time, you can find great deals on decorations and decor at Walmart, said Sherin. ""Just shop early, before the selection is picked over,"" she added.However, deals experts also said that great savings can be found on holiday decorations if you're patient. According to AllThingsTarget.com, the store offers holiday sale prices for as low as 90 percent off for Valentine's Day, Easter, summer, back-to-school, Halloween and Christmas items.A number of deals experts have noted Walmart's great prices on disposable razors. ""I've been buying my Schick disposable razors at Walmart for years and pay 20 to 30 percent less than at Target or Amazon,"" said James.But, Target has Bed Bath & Beyond beat when it comes to Gillette Sensor2 10-packs of disposable razors. And where Target's prices aren't lower than Bed Bath & Beyond's, such as with Venus Spa women's razor, Target price-match policy covers BedBathandBeyond.com.""Target and Walmart are both good places to pick up an iPhone,"" said Benjamin Glaser who formerly worked at DealNews. The big-box stores tend to have competitive discounts, and often bundle phones with gift cards. Walmart frequently has best prices on prepaid iPhones, like an iPhone 11 for $299.Pet food might not be one of the best things to buy at Walmart or Target, but you'll find great prices on toys for your pet, said Sherin. Both Petsmart.com and Petco.com are covered by Walmart and Target's price-match policy.Therefore, pet toys like the KONG Classic Dog Toy -- which is cheaper on Petco.com and Petsmart.com -- can be price matched at Walmart and Target.All women understand the necessity to be prepared -- but don't bother overpaying for disposable feminine products at your local drugstore. The same combo pack of U by Kotex tampons is priced wildly different -- at CVS, the 34-pack is $14.79, whereas at Target it's listed at $9.39.Nobody wants to cause a stink -- literally. But don't sweat the cost of deodorant. If you opt to buy it at Target versus your local drugstore, your dollar will stretch a whole lot more. At CVS, a stick of Secret Invisible Solid deodorant will run you $7.99, but if you head to Target, you'll get a the same product for $5.99.Having a multi-cat household can get a little pungent -- especially when the litter box is begging for a refresh. Cat litter isn't cheap though -- at PetSmart, a 20-pound container of Tidy Cats litter is $15.29. However, looking at Walmart, you can get it for just $19.68 for a lot more.Driving a car can get expensive -- besides the gas you put in the tank, every little function adds up. Opting to get your car care items at a big-box store like Target or Walmart will definitely make the wheels turn a little cheaper, however. Take this Rain-X water repellent -- listed for $9.99 at Advance Auto Parts; you can snag it for $6.44 from Walmart.When it's time to get cozy, you might want to spare no expense. Good news: You can still snuggle in luxury without the big name price tag. Instead of opting for a trendy comforter upwards of $40 from a place like Bed Bath & Beyond, head to Walmart and pick up a comparable -- and trendy -- one for as little as $14.99.Spring is right around the corner -- and where there's spring, there's time to lounge in the backyard. Upgrade your patio with a little help from Target -- they regularly offer discounts on stylish patio furniture, such as 30 percent off. And if you wait until mid-summer, you might get an even bigger discount.Don't rule out Walmart and Target as a one-stop shop for your audio needs if you're looking for a new pair of headphones. Beats by Dr. Dre - Beats Studio Buds Totally Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds retail for $149.99 at Best Buy, but Walmart is offering the exact same pair for about $79.99.Once you drop a dime on a new cellphone, it would be in your best interest not to skimp out on a case to protect your new purchase for years to come. Rather than getting pressured to spend upwards of $60 for an Otterbox at specialty stores like Best Buy, jump on Walmart's website and snag one for under $50.Adding a new addition to your family is always going to be a shock to the system -- especially where the wallet is concerned. Your little one needs nutrients though, so why not give them the best for less? Many baby specialty stores only offer single packs of the precious baby formula, but at stores, like Walmart and Target, you can snag a multi-pack and have it delivered right to your door -- and you're saving in bulk.When it comes to food on the go, there's nothing quite like the go-to TV dinner. Rather than paying the markup for a Hungry Man or Lean Cuisine from a convenience store or drugstore, stock up the next time you make your way to Walmart -- certain TV dinners like Stouffers and Michelina's can go for as little as $1.34.Your sleep is probably very precious to you -- as it should be. Those eight hours are your recharge time, and a good set of blackout curtains will help you make the most of your time in the sack. Instead of dropping anywhere from $16 to $32 dollars on a set of room-darkening window panels at Bed Bath and Beyond, head to Walmart and grab their Mainstays-branded version for under $10.Everyone wants to spruce up their living space. Instead of dropping a mint at a fancy home decor store like Crate & Barrel, head to your local Target for the same decor flair at a smaller price. Check out their trendy art deco wall pieces -- plus, they often run serious sales like the 25 percent off all home goods sale running right now.Don't get stuck paying a premium for your perfect pout. Many drugstore brands are giving high-end makeup brands a run for their money -- and you can save yourself a fortune by finding your perfect shade within the walls of your local Walmart or Target.If you're a homeowner -- or even just a hobbyist -- it can get expensive to start expanding your power tools collection. Instead of dropping anywhere from $45 and up for a circular saw, opt to grab one from Walmart for as low as $32.88.When it comes to your morning routine, most people don't like to mess around -- especially when it comes to their cup of coffee. Instead of opting for a Keurig from Bed Bath & Beyond or other boutique stores, head to your local Walmart and snag the same coffee maker for $54.99.Vegans and lactose-intolerant masses, rejoice: It's become extremely easy to find non-dairy options in nearly every neighborhood store. Target might take the cake as far as affordable non-dairy options go. In addition to their wide array of options -- almond, soy, cashew, even pea -- they offer consistently low prices on the staples, whereas stricter grocery stores might mark up their non-dairy options.This is a case where the savings is in the added accessories. If you wanted to up your camera game, it might be time to get a DSL-R like Canon's EOS Rebel T7. Best Buy has it for sale for $399.99 -- but Walmart offers it as a bundle with a photo bag, telephoto lens, wide-angle lens, tripod, remote and more for a similar price.Clutter causes stress, that much is true. Even if you don't have the time to un-clutter your space, why not opt for some more home storage options so at least your stuff has a space to call home? Target is offering a 66-quart latching Sterilite home storage crate for just $9.59 -- big enough to handle even your most massive messes.Don't forget to check out Walmart and Target for the best deals if you need to upgrade your kitchen appliances. Instead of paying a premium at appliance stores, some microwaves at Walmart retail for less than $65.Vacuums suck -- at least, they're supposed to. But don't get caught up in the price hype from specialty retailers when you're in the market for a new household appliance -- big-box stores like Target and Walmart have the same products for even smaller price tags. For example, a quick look at Target's website shows that vacuums from BISSELL, Dyson and Hoover are all on sale -- some for less than $100.Stylish workwear for women doesn't have to come at high costs. Target rolled out its Who What Wear womenswear line as an answer to pricey retailers like Express and New York and Company, making trendy clothing at an accessible price point -- especially when it goes on clearance.Instead of spending up for trendy Lululemon or Athleta activewear, head to Target for their reinventive take on active style: JoyLab. With modern and eye-catching designs, JoyLab's ""fashion meets function"" tagline aptly describes this affordable collection.It's good for you, great on the go, and fantastic for your gut -- it's yogurt, and you shouldn't get stuck paying an arm and a leg for your daily dose of dairy. Instead of paying a premium price tag at dedicated grocers, stores like Walmart and Target often have overflowing flavor selections when it comes to your 'gurt -- and if you opt for the store brand like Walmart's Great Value brand, you have the potential to save even more cents.Instead of spending upwards of $5 for a greeting card next time you wander into a Hallmark store, skip the premium pricing and head to Walmart and save. You can get greeting cards in bulk -- spending the same price for multiple cards.Instead of spending a ton of cash at Lucky Brand Jeans or Urban Outfitters, opt for another of Target's exclusive clothing collections for your latest hippie chic womenswear. Target's Knox Rose brand seamlessly blends boho-chic sensibility with an affordable price point -- a true match made in heaven.Does sickness get you down? You might think your first stop is to a drugstore or pharmacy, but if you're willing to brave the likes of Target or Walmart, your bottom line will thank you. For example, Dayquil Severe retails for a whopping $14.79 at CVS, but the Walmart store-brand equivalent comes in at just $11.93. Feel better yet?Candy is dandy, but savings are sweeter. Next time you're in the convenience store, you might be tempted to snag a $2 candy bar next to the register. Instead of indulging at a high cost, wait until you get to Walmart -- you can snag a giant-sized chocolate bar for $2 to $4.Walmart and Target both provide a list of online retailers whose prices they will match, subject to review. Please note that you should always contact the retailer to verify a price match. And if you want to price match at a local Walmart store, talk to the store about its price-match policy.Here's the list of online retailers that both Walmart and Target say they will price match: Amazon, Bed Bath & Beyond, Best Buy, Dick's Sporting Goods, JCPenney, Kohls, Newegg, Office Depot, Petco, PetSmart, Sports Authority, Staples and Walgreens.More From GOBankingRatesHouses in These Cities Are Suddenly BargainsGet Top Travel Tips To Help You Save More3 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000Financial Insight in Your Inbox: Sign Up for GBR's Daily Newsletter","May 3, 2023 at 1:00 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/40-best-things-buy-walmart-180004196.html,GOBankingRates,1.0,0.3,0.19863539495483945,0.4491791104985551
AMZN,Looking for a Growth Stock? 3 Reasons Why Amazon (AMZN) is a Solid Choice,"Investors seek growth stocks to capitalize on above-average growth in financials that help these securities grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task.In addition to volatility, these stocks carry above-average risk by their very nature. Also, one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end.However, the task of finding cutting-edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.Amazon (AMZN) is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system. In addition to a favorable Growth Score, it carries a top Zacks Rank.Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this online retailer a great growth pick right now.Earnings GrowthEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.While the historical EPS growth rate for Amazon is 17.3%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 117.4% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 42%.Impressive Asset Utilization RatioGrowth investors often overlook asset utilization ratio, also known as sales-to-total-assets (S/TA) ratio, but it is an important feature of a real growth stock. This metric shows how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales.Right now, Amazon has an S/TA ratio of 1.18, which means that the company gets $1.18 in sales for each dollar in assets. Comparing this to the industry average of 0.78, it can be said that the company is more efficient.In addition to efficiency in generating sales, sales growth plays an important role. And Amazon looks attractive from a sales growth perspective as well. The company's sales are expected to grow 8.7% this year versus the industry average of 3%.Promising Earnings Estimate RevisionsSuperiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.The current-year earnings estimates for Amazon have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 15.2% over the past month.Bottom LineWhile the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Amazon a Zacks Rank #2 stock, it has earned itself a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This combination indicates that Amazon is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.Amazon.com, Inc.

AMZN,Warren Buffett: Heres how to invest like the Berkshire Hathaway CEO,"So what exactly is his investment philosophy? It’s centered around the principle of value investing, which involves finding undervalued companies that focus on long-term earnings rather than short-term growth.In other words, rather than buying stocks, he buys businesses that have a competitive advantage. This approach has made him one of the most successful investors in history, and anyone can invest like him by following his strategies.Buffett says he buys what he knows, which is why Berkshire is the largest shareholder in Coca-Cola and Kraft Heinz.Does his approach cause him to miss a few big winners? Sure. He passed on Tesla and Google and was very late to Apple and Amazon.To invest like Buffett, buy what you know. Buy a business, not a stock.

AMZN,Tough Time Ahead for Cloud Computing ETFs?,"Cloud computing has been a booming market in recent years as more and more businesses move their workloads to the cloud. However, with economic uncertainty on the horizon, companies are looking for ways to trim costs. This has led to slower revenue growth for cloud divisions at major companies such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Google. As a result, cloud computing segment may be facing a tough time ahead as cloud providers are feeling the pinch, as quoted on a CNBC article.In 2022, fears of a recession began to hit the economy, causing a deceleration in the third and fourth quarters for Amazon Web Services (AWS) and a slowdown in December for Microsoft. Last quarter, Microsoft finance chief Amy Hood spooked analysts with comments about the expected continuation of this slowdown.Amazon finance chief Brian Olsavsky recently reported that in April, AWS revenue growth had slumped by about five percentage points from the first-quarter growth rate of almost 16%. Similarly, at Google, cloud growth slowed to 28% from a year earlier in the first quarter from 32% in the prior period, despite reaching profitability for the first time on record. Ruth Porat, Alphabet’s finance chief, noted that slower consumption growth was due to customers looking to optimize their costs.As a result of this deceleration in growth, cloud computing ETFs could be facing a challenging time. Investors may be hesitant to invest in these ETFs as the growth outlook for the industry appears to be slowing down. The recent slide in Amazon’s stock price is an indication that investors are not confident in the future growth prospects of cloud computing.Despite the current challenges facing cloud providers, they remain optimistic about the long-term prospects of the industry. According to Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, only 90% of global IT spend is still on-premises, indicating that there is still a lot of room for growth in the cloud computing industry. Microsoft’s Amy Hood also noted that the financial comparisons will soon be against numbers from the point last year when the market was softening, which could lead to a more positive outlook.In the first quarter of 2023, although there was a lower year-on-year growth rate of 20% compared to the previous year, there were some encouraging developments such as the global revenue figure of $63 billion, which was an increase of over $10 billion from Q1 2022.Cloud computing ETFs may face a challenging time in the near future as cloud providers experience a deceleration in growth due to businesses looking to trim costs. However, with optimism for the future growth prospects of the industry, investors should remain cautious but not dismissive. The cloud computing market still has significant potential for growth, and a long-term view may be necessary for investors looking to benefit from the sector.WisdomTree Cloud Computing ETF (WCLD): ETF Research ReportsDirexion Daily Cloud Computing Bull 2X Shares (CLDL): ETF Research ReportsFidelity Cloud Computing ETF (FCLD): ETF Research ReportsTo read this article on Zacks.com click here.Zacks Investment Research","May 3, 2023 at 5:00 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tough-time-ahead-cloud-computing-100010122.html,Zacks,-0.3888888888888889,0.8333333333333334,0.06752701432933991,0.3918839558374442

AMZN,Cloud and e-Commerce Growth Slowdown Overshadow Amazon's Quarterly Results,"Total revenue increased 9.4% to $127.4 billion while net income amounted to $3.2 billion, or 31 cents per share, improving from last year’s comparable quarter when the bottom line was a net loss that amounted to 3.8 billion or 38 cents per share.Operating income was $4.8 billion, rising from last year’s $3.67 billion, and therefore showing that Amazon’s cost cutting efforts are starting to pay off. Bloomberg reported that analysts, on average, projected $3 billion.Like Meta whose online advertising business went back to growth after three quarters of sales declines,  Amazon’s advertising sales grew 23% to $9.51 billion,  and seller services jumped 18% to $29.8 billion.Amazon Web Services, the largest seller of rented computing power and software services who is facing off Microsoft and Alphabet's Google saw its revenue rise 16% as it amounted to $21.4 billion. While the growth rate topped Wall Street estimates, it was a record low since Amazon began reporting AWS sales, with sales slowing down further in April.Amazon still relies on AWS as its main source of operating income that helped the company fund its biggest bets. Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky also noted that AWS is less profitable now than it was a year ago partly due to discounts given to longer-term contracts as consumers became more cost-conscious in the current macroeconomic climate.As the pandemic-era boost became history, Amazon’s core e-commerce business was flat compared to 2022’s quarter, dropping about 4% from 2021’s quarter.Amazon projects both revenue and profit for the undergoing quarter to be in line with expectations. Even with the cloud slowdown, sales are expected in the range between $127 billion to $133 billion and operating profit in the range between $2 billion to $5.5 billion.As CEO Andy Jassy put it, machine learning is deeply ingrained in everything that Amazon does. With 25 years of experience in the field, Jassy is certain that AWS will benefit from AI developments as it will help companies customize the technology for their own needs. Jassy also revealed that AmazonIis developing computer chips involved in training large-language models which are the basis of Microsoft’s OpenAI’s ChatGPT.Even big tech knows the importance of lowering costs. Meta has targeted to reduce its 2023 operating expenses by $3 billion, cutting about 21,000 jobs over two rounds of layoffs in March and back in November. After more than a year of intense cost-cutting strategy under which Amazon will erase 27,000 jobs, results suggest its efforts have already started to pay off. Operating expenses rose 8.7%  which is the slowest pace in at least a decade. With Jessy at the helm, new warehouse expansion got slowed down and construction of its second HQ in Virginia got paused.  For the first time since late 2021, the North America segment was profitable on an operating basis.Last Wednesday, Amazon announced its latest round of layoffs that mostly concern AWS employees. As of March 31st, it employed 1.47 million people which is 10% less than last year's comparable quarter, being down from 1.54 million workers who were employed at the end of the previous quarter, three months earlier.The first quarter earnings reflect that Amazon has been shifting towards its more profitable businesses such as selling advertising and services to independent merchants who rent space in its warehouses and on its website. With e-commerce and cloud business slowing down, like Meta, Amazon benefited from the recovery of digital advertising..© 2023 Benzinga.com. Benzinga does not provide investment advice.

AMZN,Amazon (AMZN) Is Considered a Good Investment by Brokers: Is That True?,"When deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock, investors often rely on analyst recommendations. Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?Amazon currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.17, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 39 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.17 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 39 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 33 are Strong Buy and five are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 84.6% and 12.8% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for AMZNDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.ABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.Should You Invest in AMZN?Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for Amazon, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 13.7% over the past month to $1.52.Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Amazon.

AMZN,Hollywood writers begin strike as guild says studios 'closed the door' on labor force,"""The companies' behavior has created a gig economy inside a union workforce, and their immovable stance in this negotiation has betrayed a commitment to further devaluing the profession of writing,"" the guild added.""From their refusal to guarantee any level of weekly employment in episodic television, to the creation of a 'day rate' in comedy variety, to their stonewalling on free work for screenwriters and on AI for all writers, they have closed the door on their labor force and opened the door to writing as an entirely freelance profession. No such deal could ever be contemplated by this membership.""The WGA had been negotiating with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), which bargains on behalf of studios including Netflix, Amazon, Apple, Disney, Warner Bros. Discovery NBCUniversal, Paramount, and Sony.""The AMPTP presented a comprehensive package proposal to the Guild last night which included generous increases in compensation for writers as well as improvements in streaming residuals,"" the AMPTP said in a statement. ""The AMPTP also indicated to the WGA that it is prepared to improve that offer, but was unwilling to do so because of the magnitude of other proposals still on the table that the Guild continues to insist upon.""Yahoo Finance reached out for additional comment from the major Hollywood studios engaged in the talks but did not immediately hear back.The TV and movie industry today is being dramatically reshaped by the impact of streaming services.Streaming shows often have fewer episodes and less residual income compared to traditional network television, which often means less money in the pockets of writers.At the same time, the majority of studios are no longer just ""pure play"" production houses. Rather, they have their own streaming divisions, which have brought on a new set of challenges as direct-to-consumer losses mount.""Whether this is a blip on the radar or a prolonged strike like in 2007 remains to be seen,"" Scott Purdy, US media industry leader at KPMG, told Yahoo Finance. ""In the near term though, consumers should prepare for some of their favorite TV shows to be delayed and to potentially enter a period where there’s a limited amount of new content to watch. We’ll be watching to see how this impacts subscription decisions with inflation-pinched consumers who were already reassessing their spending habits.""Late night television shows will be the first to feel the impact.Studio executives have said they have enough scripted content banked to prevent disruptions to the content pipeline.The writers' strike will likely have serious economic implications, as the last strike demonstrated.According to estimates from the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corp., that strike, which lasted 100 days from November 2007 to February 2008, cost the Los Angeles County economy a whopping $2.5 billion.Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance","May 2, 2023 at 7:15 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hollywood-writers-begin-strike-as-guild-says-studios-closed-the-door-on-labor-force-121510329.html,Yahoo Finance,-0.1,0.1,0.06788059163059162,0.4631204906204906

AMZN,9 Worst Items That Amazon Reviewers Say Not To Buy,"The online retailer is currently testing a new feature that helps customers by alerting them when a product they are browsing has a high return rate. This feature adds an orange label, identifying the product as a “Frequently Returned Item,” and Amazon has just begun rolling it out. The company says this will help shoppers make more informed decisions and avoid buying low-quality or misleading items.Price: $99.98Reviews mention the low suction power, especially on rugs, and that it doesn’t pick up dirt and dust very well. Some reviewers say they loved the vacuum at first, but that it broke quickly or just stopped working after a few months. Plus, a lot of people had trouble getting help from customer service or getting their money back.Price: $65.02The 1-star reviews for this waffle maker reveal a number of common complaints. Some of the most prevalent issues include the unit failing to turn on or stopping working altogether after only a few uses. Another common issue is that the plates on the waffle iron do not fit securely and move around while cooking, which is a potential safety hazard. Additionally, many customers have reported that the entire unit becomes dangerously hot during use.One reviewer said, “The exterior gets to be hundreds of degrees hot. it will burn you instantly if you touch the machine for even a millisecond. It’s so hot it even burns itself; you can smell plastic burning when it’s running.”Price: $49.99Many reviewers said it stopped working pretty quickly. Others said it leaked water or coffee all over the place. More than one reviewer said the coffee had a persistent plastic taste that wouldn’t go away.Overall, it sounds like this coffee maker might not be the best choice if you’re looking for something that’s going to last and make great coffee.Price: $26.90However, they also have some drawbacks that may make you think twice before buying. According to some 1-star reviews, these earbuds have a short battery life, and a bass-heavy sound profile that can drown out the mids and highs. Some users also complained about the physical buttons on the earbuds, which are hard to press and can hurt your ears. If you’re looking for a more balanced and durable pair of wireless earbuds, you may want to look elsewhere.Price: $162.59Price: $129.99Some reviewers mentioned that the chair is easy to assemble, but others had trouble with the pre-drilled holes not aligning correctly, which can make assembly a frustrating and time-consuming process. Another significant complaint is that the chair is incredibly creaky and noisy, which can be distracting and uncomfortable. Some customers reported that the chair feels unstable and like it could fall apart at any moment, and several reviewers mentioned that the chair may not be suitable for larger or taller individuals.Price: $12.98If you are looking for a diffuser that will make your car smell like a spa, this is not the one for you. The majority of negative reviews are centered around issues with the diffuser leaking, breaking or simply not working after only a few uses. These problems can be incredibly frustrating for consumers who have invested in the product and were hoping for a reliable and long-lasting option. Furthermore, a few reviewers reported that the diffuser damaged their car sockets, which could be a significant issue for those using it while on the go. Overall, it appears that the diffuser is not very reliable, durable or effective in some cases, based on the range of negative feedback that has been left.One reviewer wrote: “I bought two of these and they both broke in a week. Well a replacement they just sent me also broke in a week. It seems you are extremely lucky if you get one that works for longer. I am returning this product, it’s garbage!”Price: $13.98Several reviewers reported that the humidifier leaks water and can cause damage to nearby furniture, which can be a significant concern for those who have invested in expensive pieces. Another common complaint is that the humidifier makes a loud noise, which can be distracting and disruptive, especially if you’re trying to use it while sleeping or working. Some customers even reported mold growth inside the humidifier, which is not only smelly, but can be a health hazard.Price: $20.50If you are looking for a toaster that can burn your bread, break down after a few uses or catch on fire, then this is the product for you. According to the 1-star reviews on Amazon, this toaster has many flaws and dissatisfied customers. Many reviews mention that the toaster seems to get dangerously hot.

AMZN,3 Things About Rivian Automotive That Smart Investors Know,"Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ: RIVN) was one of the hottest electric vehicle IPOs of 2021.

GOOG,Google set to launch foldable Pixel smartphone,"Yahoo Finance’s Daniel Howley joins the Live show to discuss the expectations for Google I/O 2023, an annual developer conference held by Google in Mountain View, CA.[AUDIO LOGO]Likely, we'll hear conversation about how Google is going to start putting that kind of technology into its search product. So they've discussed how they want to do that. In the past, they announced their Bard AI chatbot. That's in limited preview, so maybe we'll get that available to everyone at some point. And then the search aspect and how generative AI would go into search.But then, as you said, we have those phones also coming. There's the foldable that, you know, looks really, really interesting. They showed it off in a tweet. And I mean, we have seen foldable phones from competitors, like Samsung, but this one looks like it's got a few differences from the Samsung foldable to make it interesting, though. To be honest, I'm still not totally sold on a foldable phone yet.Dan, unlike Apple, Google can't seem to keep new devices under wraps, though. And so with this foldable Pixel device, you know, how does this all play into their broader kind of tech strategy or at least consumer technology strategy?So it's something that they use to, basically, serve as a platform for other companies to say, look, this is what an Android phone is capable of doing when done as we see fit, or as we want it to be done. And so they focus on a lot of different technologies inside the device, whether that's reducing motion blur, night photography-- that's some of the best out there-- special capabilities for when you receive a phone call.So they do have all of this AI smarts, or these AI smarts, in their phones that you really won't find on other devices. But the hardware themselves, you know, it's something that margins aren't gonna be as good as the advertising services. And so it's never gonna be kind of the main bread and butter for Google and Alphabet. It'll continue to be the search side. But it is something that they, seemingly, want to continue to move forward with for a while.","May 8, 2023 at 9:34 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/google-set-launch-foldable-pixel-143459230.html,Yahoo Finance Video,0.0,0.0,0.22850432900432904,0.4975865800865801
GOOG,Weekly Stock List,"Innovation may be hard to define but, to borrow from former U.S. Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart, you know it when you see it. The United States economy is full of innovation. It has to be. Manufacturing industries that dominated the economy decades ago - textiles, televisions, even automobiles, to a large degree - have moved overseas, where costs are lower. Yet the U.S. economy is at its largest point in history and still growing. If U.S. corporations weren't innovating, creating new products and services, and moving into new markets and applications, the domestic economy would be contracting, not expanding, and capital would not be flooding into the country. Particularly at this juncture of the market and economic cycles, when uncertainty is high due to high inflation and rising interest rates, we look to innovative companies to successfully navigate the challenges. At Argus, an 88-year-old independent research firm that has innovated a time or two in its long history, we have focused on four types of innovative companies: Industry Disruptors; First to Market; New Product Specialists; and Product & Process Perfectors.

GOOG,Apple isnt playing the AI hype game,"In fact, Cook didn’t mention the topic at all in his statement. The only time the CEO broached the topic was when he was prodded by Credit Suisse’s Shannon Cross, who asked for Cook’s thoughts on generative AI and where he sees it going. True to form, the CEO was light on specifics.Despite not mentioning the hottest buzzword since blockchain in his statement, shares of Cook’s Apple jumped more than 4% Friday. It’s not as though Apple doesn’t use AI either. Nearly every product Apple offers takes advantage of AI and machine learning.Cook specifically called out the company’s use of the technology to power the Apple Watch’s fall detection and ECG, as well as the crash detection capabilities in the watch and iPhone.“It's absolutely remarkable,” Cook said. “And so we view AI as huge and we'll continue weaving it in our products on a very thoughtful basis.”Apple is also set to hold its annual WWDC developer conference next month, during which it could make some kind of announcement regarding generative AI.But Apple’s ethos is to let technology largely fade into the background while boosting its products as a means to an end. In other words, if Apple does begin implementing some form of generative AI into its product portfolio, don’t expect the company to dwell on the fact that it’s doing so.If anything, you’ll hear about how the technology will power an updated version of Siri, or perhaps become a new assistant meant to help you better plan things like trips or your daily work schedule.However Apple decides to approach generative AI, bank on the company focusing more on how it helps its products, rather than the tech itself.For the latest earnings reports and analysis, earnings whispers and expectations, and company earnings news, click hereRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance","May 5, 2023 at 2:07 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-isnt-playing-the-ai-hype-game-190726240.html,Yahoo Finance,-0.4,0.4,0.28312615955473097,0.5003865182436611

Not a lot of talk about that for Apple.They're going to see if the market responds to somebody else's folding phone, and then they're going to decide, OK, the market wants it. Let's do something even better. And so it sounds like they're going to stay true to themselves when it comes to generative AI as well or, at least, not put all their cards on the table right now.","May 4, 2023 at 6:39 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/apples-q2-earnings-call-wheres-233937904.html,Yahoo Finance Video,0.0,0.0,0.1552202699261523,0.41511331805449453

GOOG,You can now sign up for Microsoft's Bing without a waitlist,"In a press announcement early Thursday, Microsoft CVP Yusuf Mehdi announced that Bing, which is powered by OpenAI’s GPT-4 technology, is now available to the general public as an open preview. In other words, you can now use Bing without first having to sign up for a waitlist as long as you have a Microsoft account.More important than making Bing available to the general public, though, is word that Microsoft is making it so third-party developers can build their own app plug-ins into the software.“For example, if you’re researching the latest restaurant for dinner in Bing chat, it will leverage OpenTable to help you find and book a reservation,” Mehdi explained in a statement. “Or, with Wolfram|Alpha, you can create powerful visualizations and get answers to complex science, math, and human-curated data-based questions directly from Bing chat.”The idea is to make Bing chat a kind of one-stop shop for search, allowing consumers to both ask questions and receive answers via text and images.Mehdi says Bing is also expanding its existing Bing Image Creator, which is a part of Bing chat, to 100 more languages, opening up the app to far more users than before.In the future, he says, you’ll also be able to upload images to Bing chat and search for similar content.In terms of basic capabilities, Bing is also adding the ability to go back to your chat history and pick up where you left off during a previous session. You’ll also be able to export and share your chats to other apps. Microsoft, though, didn’t say which apps outside of Microsoft Word.According to Mehdi, Bing users have already taken part in 500 million chats with the bot in the 90 days since it went live. The app now has 100 million users and mobile app downloads have increased 4x.But Microsoft isn’t looking to dethrone the search giant just yet. When discussing the potential for search, the company speaks in terms of market share percentages. When the company debuted Bing in February, Microsoft representatives said that every one percent of market share Bing can take from Google is worth $2 billion in revenue.With Microsoft continuing to innovate on Bing, and Google’s Bard still in a limited preview, the Windows maker could be backing its rival into a corner.Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance","May 4, 2023 at 2:00 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/you-can-now-sign-up-for-microsofts-bing-without-a-waitlist-070003038.html,Yahoo Finance,0.0,0.0,0.16534021534021534,0.4737484737484738
GOOG,Apples earnings could buoy or sink Big Techs earnings season,"Wednesday, May 3, 2023“None of what's already been reported matters come Thursday night,” explained Deepwater Asset Management Managing Partner Gene Munster.“And the reason is ... because [of] the size of Apple, and also it's been relatively stable too. It's done a better job of enduring this versus other tech, so if there is a problem, you can throw out all the good news from Microsoft and Google and Meta,” Munster added.In turn, a solid result from Apple could help buoy the industry and drive up shares of other Big Tech names. But a miss could mean increased pressure on rival tech stocks, just as the sector looks to finally move past its COVID-induced hangover.Analysts expect Apple to report revenue of $92.6 billion for the second quarter, a 4.8% decline from the $97.3 billion Apple brought in during the same quarter last year. That's about in line with the 5% decline Apple posted in Q1.“We believe the broader tech industry is all on pins and needles waiting for Apple's results as many of the tech haters continue to yell fire in a crowded theater around softening demand, with Apple the best barometer globally of this metric,” Wedbush Managing Director Dan Ives told Yahoo Finance via email.For investors tracking the S&P 500, a miss by Apple could have an outsized impact on their portfolios.While Apple’s enormous size and weight relative to market competitors gives its results added importance, the company’s performance is also a key indicator for consumer spending.“Most, if not all, iPhones are purchased for consumers. Macs, for the most part, are purchased for consumers and/or small, medium businesses,” explained UBS Managing Director David Vogt. “So it's really more of a bellwether or a barometer regarding high end consumer spending.”A miss on Apple’s revenue, especially for its iPhone business, would mean consumers are spending less and holding back on making large purchases. Worse still would be any signal that revenue will come in weaker than anticipated in Q3. That would signal that Apple anticipates customers will continue to hold back on spending their cash.It all comes down to Thursday night.

GOOG,"Tech earnings: It will take about three quarters to see rebound in ad market, analyst says","R ""Ray"" Wang, Constellation Research Principal Analyst & Founder discusses the upcoming week in tech earnings and previews if he believes the market is ready for a rebound.Microsoft is much more top-down. And so they launched all the ChatGPT, the co-pilots, and went full on against Google for digital ads, as well as where they were going with their open AI investment. So it's a two-horse race, and it's going be interesting to see what happens. But the bottom line is we might not have enough data to be able to do all the things at a level of precision.So if your AI physician is 93% accurate, would you do it? Probably not. But if your search for checking what's going on for self-help on a contact center call is 83% accurate, that's a win. And so we're going to see different gradations of where AI plays a role and what your comfort level is going to be.But the good news is you can do it much more quickly. If you're writing a paper or if you're actually coding, now snippets and codes are actually going to be reused very, very quickly. And so, now, you got to get really good at finding bugs or finding errors. So you change the skill sets that you're using-- just like back when I was in school-- you couldn't bring a calculator to an exam. Now everyone has these super graphical calculators that are doing all these kind of things.But we also need to have a couple of levels of ethics. First, algorithms need to be transparent. We understand what's going on. We make decisions by bias. But if you have unwanted bias, we actually have to be able to understand what's happening with that, so it's got to be explainable. But once you have that in place, how do you reverse things? So you're discriminating against left-handed people with purple hair? Oh, I'm so sorry. How do we actually reverse that so we learn from that? And of course, we have to train this over time. And then the last piece is, if you don't have a human in the loop. well, you might not want to know what may happen next.","May 1, 2023 at 3:44 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/tech-earnings-three-quarters-see-204448396.html,Yahoo Finance Video,0.0,0.0,0.2387096774193548,0.4188172043010752

The ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine may just be endless, experts have told me recently.All of this will be front and center for power brokers from inside governments around the world and Corporate America at the Milken conference. I can tell you as well there will be a ton of AI talk, which comes after a ton of AI talk last week from Microsoft, Google, Meta and Snap.

GOOG,AI talk prevails in tech earnings calls,"Yahoo Finance Tech Editor Dan Howley discusses the predominant mentions of AI development amongst tech earnings this week.But when we look at how many times-- just rattling this off is-- it doesn't really give you a total understanding of what the calls had to say, but just giving you an idea. Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Alphabet, mentioned AI 34 times during his opening remarks for the call. That doesn't include the question-and-answer part. Satya Nadella-- 31 times. And Mark Zuckerberg during his own call-- 22 times.This is just showing how important the AI space is to these companies. Now, we obviously have this kind of inkling that Microsoft is in the lead at this point because of its partnership with OpenAI. Google really trying to say, whoa, whoa, whoa, we basically helped create the technology that OpenAI uses, this transformer technology. We did the papers on it, the research.And then Meta is saying, hey, the Metaverse is cool and all. We're still going to invest in that. But AI is something that we really want to talk about. They jumped in to start off discussions with Mark Zuckerberg pointing towards the company's layoffs, but then right away dove into AI and how the company's innovating there and working on it and has been using it and will continue to use it. And it's going to help the Metaverse and vice versa. So AI-- so far, at least-- the leading piece of conversation. We still have big names like Apple and Nvidia coming.ChatGPT is more or less a souped up version of that, right? So it's not as though this technology is incredibly new. It's being implemented in ways that are exciting and new. Microsoft basically just laying it across its entire stack. Google working on that as well. Meta trying to figure out where they kind of fit in this conversation exactly. They were talking about chat bots. It's kind of been there, done that before, but let's see where generative AI can bring us.So I do think that it is part hype, part actual product.

GOOG,This earnings season is all about AI,"If there’s one lesson we can take away from first-quarter earnings so far, it’s that Big Tech’s CEOs are all in on AI. Need proof? Just listen to what they have to say during their companies’ earnings calls.The CEO mentioned AI 34 times in his opening remarks alone. It was the first topic he covered, ahead of Alphabet’s cost-cutting efforts and even Google Cloud, which the company is trying to grow to catch up to cloud offerings from rivals Microsoft and Amazon.“Our investments and breakthroughs in AI over the last decade have positioned us well,” Pichai said during the call. He then went on to explain how AI is already being used or being built into everything from Google’s advertising offerings to its productivity suite.And, of course, the CEO was sure to mention how Google is working to bring generative AI to its all-important search business.“We’ll be guided by data and years of experience about what people want and our high standards for quality,” he said. “And we will test and iterate as we go, because we know that billions of people trust Google to provide the right information.Alphabet finds itself in an unfamiliar position. The company has long dominated AI research thanks to its world-class teams. Heck, Google is responsible for some of the research behind the transformer technology that powers OpenAI’s ChatGPT.“We are focused on continuing to raise the bar on our operational excellence and performance, as we innovate to help our customers maximize the value of their existing technology investments and thrive in the new era of AI,” Nadella said.And nowhere was Nadella more emphatic about the company’s AI future than when he mentioned how it will impact Microsoft’s quest to take on Google Search with its own Bing search engine.“We look forward to continuing this journey in what is a generational shift in the largest software category – search,” Nadella said.He mentioned AI 22 times during his rundown on the call, saying it’s improving monetization for the company’s ads, driving recommendation engines for its services, and could lead to AI chat bots for Messenger and WhatsApp. Zuckerberg also dove into how the company is investing in the infrastructure needed to power its AI ambitions.Naturally, the CEO tied his company’s AI efforts with his long-term plans for the metaverse. Zuckerberg insisted that he’s not ditching the metaverse in favor of AI, and instead said that the two technologies will benefit each other.Meta, like Alphabet and Microsoft, has a powerful AI division and has been working in the space for years. But the excitement generated by OpenAI and ChatGPT has forced the company to respond by putting AI front and center in its investor statements.There’s still a cavalcade of companies preparing to report their quarterly results, including the likes of Apple and Nvidia.

GOOG,AI 'misunderstood' by companies: Builder.AI Founder,"Artificial Intelligence's staggering rise in the last few months has left investors confident in its ability to transform sectors; it's also forcing companies to adjust their game plans. Some experts however, are seeing a different side of the story, as valuations of AI-related entities continue to rocket ever higher. ""The most important thing I'm hearing is a little bit of hysteria meets a little bit of confusion"", Sachin Dev Duggal the founder of Builder AI tells Yahoo Finance's Julie Hyman and Ines Ferre.The man behind the platform that allows people to build software applications using the technology, says AI is ""misunderstood"" by businesses. Offering the promise of self-driving cars, high-intelligence chat bots and large-scale data analysis, companies are seemingly jumping on the bandwagon. ""It's something new and everybody's talking about it,"" he says.

So take Tesla, has the largest deployed fleet of robots in the world. If you can turn those cars they sold into robotaxis, then that transforms their economic model. Given the pace of advance in AI, Tesla is better positioned to take economic advantage of it than some of the underlying AI-focused tech companies that are beginning to compete with each other in a really aggressive way.But Sachin, I'm curious, there is such of this clamoring about AI. What are you hearing from customers and potential customers? Is this something that they are getting really excited about here? And just for people who aren't familiar, give us, like, the 20-second description of what you guys do.And what we're hearing from customers is an element of excitement because it's something new, and everybody is talking about it, but it's coming with an equal dose of confusion in terms of how they might use it.

GOOG,"Alphabet, Meta, Amazon: The ad spend gloom continues","Yahoo Finance’s Daniel Howley joins the Live show to discuss the ad spend gloom hovering over the tech sector.Joining us now with more is Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley. So break down this difference that we've seen with these different tech firms.On the flip side, we have Meta-- Facebook parent company Meta. They seem to be righting the ship after three consecutive quarters of revenue declines. They've turned that around and they are doing better in the advertising space.We also have, as you mentioned, Amazon, which has continued to push itself deeper and deeper into advertising. They saw revenues increase this year. It jumped, I believe, 21% year over year. If you adjust for FX though-- or if you exclude for FX though, excuse me-- they had dropped from, let's see-- they had 25% growth year over year in Q1 2022 down to 23% this year. Though they had that 21%, which was actually up from 19% when you do factor in FX. So obviously, they're doing well in that space.And then we just look at the likes of Snap and Pinterest. Snap is just a story that-- I mean, woof, that has not been great. I was following the earnings yesterday. You just saw the stock price get slammed after they announced their poor performance. And we look at Pinterest and they announced a deal with Amazon, basically saying, look, we're going to let Amazon run ads on our platform for different goods. People will then be able to click into those ads and purchase them directly through Amazon in one click, since most people who are likely using Pinterest are also Amazon users, and they can just get their account set up right away.So the advertising space really does continue to remain challenged, but there are some ""winners,"" quote unquote, at this point. And it appears that Meta really is the one that's seeming to pull away. There's a lot of talk about how they've really kind of optimized with AI. That was something that Mark Zuckerberg has talked about. I mean, you could basically throw AI in any conversation at this point and investors are going to go nuts because, I mean, it's basically the hot topic at this point.So it'll make the experience a lot easier for consumers. And you know, this means that Amazon is going to get a cut of those sales. And ideally, Pinterest will as well. They don't really give full terms of the agreement in the announcement, but you can imagine that they're both going to benefit in some way. And they think this is something that is obviously beneficial to Amazon because they're getting the sales done, but also because their advertising platform just continues to grow.I said, you know, obviously there have been some-- there's been some declining growth, but still growth. And that really just goes to show that the strength of appearing on their top spot, when it comes to products, video ads, anything along those lines, Amazon just continues to grow. And this was a footnote a few years ago.And just as they've built this out, it continues to be a more important part of the equation for them. It's not going to become the sole purpose for Amazon. AWS and actual retail sales are going to continue to dominate. But you know, where you see them struggling when it comes to retail, they do have this kind of third leg to kind of stand on. Again, it's not nearly as big as that. But it is something that's growing and could help them kind of even their business out when they go through times like this.","April 28, 2023 at 10:32 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/alphabet-meta-amazon-ad-spend-153206821.html,Yahoo Finance Video,-0.13333333333333333,0.13333333333333333,0.17186356924729018,0.4880075673680324

GOOG,"Mark Zuckerberg says AI boosts monetization by 30% on Instagram, 40% on Facebook","Time spent on Instagram went up by 24% since Meta launched AI-powered Instagram reels.“(Generative AI) is going to also help create more engaging experiences, which should create more engagement,” Meta Founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg said on the company’s earnings call Wednesday evening. “And that by itself creates more opportunities for advertisers.”In the first quarter, Meta delivered advertising revenue of $28.1 billion, above Wall Street estimates of $26.76. The company’s $2.20 earnings per share also topped analyst expectations of $2.01. Meta projects second quarter revenue in a range of $29.5 billion to $32 billion, above estimates of $29.48 billion.The stock of the company, formerly known as Facebook, rose as much as 14% in intraday trading on Thursday.AI is having its moment on tech earnings calls for the second consecutive quarter, following the widely popular launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT in late November. But not every company has the same plans for the new technology.Meta’s approach is slightly different. The core business for Meta since the early days of Facebook has been advertising sales, which still account for 98% of the company’s quarterly revenue. So naturally, enhancing advertisements with AI is where Meta believes the new technology can be most impactful.Those losses had weighed heavily on Meta’s stock in the past, but amid Meta’s “year of efficiency,” cost-cutting efforts and AI benefits have Wall Street turning more bullish. In a note to clients on Wednesday, Deutsche Bank research analyst Benjamin Black highlighted AI-driven ad performance as a catalyst for accelerating revenue growth through the rest of 2023.Zuckerberg noted on the earnings call he feels Meta is “no longer behind"" in building out an AI infrastructure. Now, the focus shifts to finding new ways to integrate and optimize the technology.“This is literally going to touch every single one of our products and services in multiple ways,” Zuckerberg said. “This is just a very big wave and new set of technologies that's available, and we're working on it across the whole company.Josh is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance","April 27, 2023 at 1:11 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mark-zuckerberg-says-ai-boosts-monetization-by-30-on-instagram-40-on-facebook-181123177.html,Yahoo Finance,0.0,0.0,0.1422989291410344,0.38563511050353155

GOOG,"Meta, Roku, Alphabet earnings: Ad figures dominate tech","Yahoo Finance’s Allie Garfinkle joins the Live show to discuss advertising beats for Meta, Roku, and Alphabet following quarterly earnings.And it was pretty impressive, frankly. They clocked a very notable advertising beat. They also had Q2 guidance that called for a 7% growth in advertising demand next quarter. They're also building out new products, like Advantage+ is what it's called. And the goal of it is simplifying advertising for marketers while improving results, right?So it's the sort of thing that was really surprising, especially given that we've heard a very different story from Alphabet, from Roku. Let's start with Roku, for example. They did clock a solid quarter overall. But that week Q2 guidance, they tied it back to continuing uncertainty in ads.And you got a similar story out of Alphabet, right? In YouTube ads, we even saw this incremental pullback in advertiser spend, is what they called it in the earnings call. And the YouTube advertising revenues were actually down 3%, as was the case for network advertising revenues which were down 8%.So you have Meta which has these beats and this optimism. And you have Alphabet and Roku which are saying, no, this is still happening. The pullback is still in place. So what is going on here?And I actually tie it back to something that a lot of experts have been telling me, which is that we are sort of towards the end of the cycle in the digital ad slowdown. It's just a matter of how close to the end of the cycle we are. So that's where we're seeing this mismatch.And I think that, you know, Meta has really set itself out to come out on top here. That said, let's not be too excited. I know that hearing that end of the digital ad cycle slow down sounds really exciting for investors. I wouldn't be too excited about Snap today.I know the stock's up, what, 2 and 1/2%, almost 3% perhaps. I wouldn't be-- I wouldn't be too optimistic just yet because even though Meta has certainly come out ahead and certainly shown us something else, we still possibly have a ways to go here before the advertising market is truly at its peak again.And part of the reason I say that it's important to keep expectations to a minimum, perhaps, for Snap is that Meta has this incredible infrastructure. And actually, it does tie back to the AI story they've been telling. They were very keen to really tie AI into advertising, the metaverse.And I'd say-- I'd say fundamentally here, let's not forget that Meta's core has always been advertising. It is truly what Meta, arguably, has been best at for so, so long. And in the end, we will see-- we will see a pullback-- we will see no a pull-- not a pullback, a push forward of sorts moving ahead. It's just a matter sort of when. And I think for Meta, they couldn't be in a better spot right now, truth be told, Rachelle.","April 27, 2023 at 10:14 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/meta-roku-alphabet-earnings-ad-151415831.html,Yahoo Finance Video,0.0,0.0,0.19526977087952702,0.4333048252560448

GOOG,Investors are too bearish on tech: Analyst,"Key Video Highlights:00:04 - Earnings: clean sweep for big tech00:30 - There's no 'boogeyman' to take down techYou're seeing across the board a lot of these names just put up very clean numbers. And the fear factor is that there's a giant boogeyman in the closet. And it's going to take down tech again. And everyone's opening the closet, and there's a giant teddy bear giving you a big hug. That's the analysis.It is-- I've done this for a long time, and I've never seen how negative investors are in tech. And rightfully so, right? We saw a big contraction as it relates to overall. The sentiment last year in tech, and it was a hard year for all of us. But I think, ultimately, we just went to super overbearish. And again, great, great discipline on expense. You're seeing that now in earnings. They now have to demonstrate the next leg, which for the stock is really going to be the revenue reacceleration.And so that's going to reaccelerate to, you know, mid to high single digit growth in the back half of the year. But we'll want to hear more about, you know, what's going to happen in the back half here and how they can pump that up. The checks, you know, that we have with advertisers is that they have lapped the iOS changes. They are seeing better ROI in the Meta platform, Instagram, in particular. They are encouraged that Mark Zuckerberg has stayed out of the press. And that has helped for advertisers, because they don't have to ask questions from their clients, as you post a picture of him.So I think, ultimately, there's been many things that are going right. But I think the common theme here is, you know, tech is-- tech is strong, stronger than most people think. Yes, we're fading, but things are a lot better than the bears have been expecting.","April 26, 2023 at 4:41 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/investors-too-bearish-tech-analyst-214113322.html,Yahoo Finance Video,0.0,0.0,0.13206552706552707,0.44842287342287335
GOOG,"Microsoft, Alphabet ramp up spending on AI as competition heats up","Yahoo Finance Live discusses the competition between Microsoft and Alphabet as the two companies ramp up their spending on AI development of search engine products.So on one hand, you have Microsoft and Satya Nadella sort of championing Search and their role that AI is playing in Search. They saw 10% growth in Search. And then, you have Alphabet and Sundar Pichai basically defending their stance in Search, at one point calling growth resilient. They saw 2% growth.Now obviously, when we think about Alphabet, when we think about Google, Search is still a major part of their business obviously, over half of their revenue.You heard them mention Bing several times yesterday. They said that Bing downloads have now 4X-ed over the last two months. And that mobile app, they didn't even mention Bing last year on that earnings call. So, a clear shift from Microsoft to say, hey, we want to talk about Bing, and we want to talk about Search. Because we're going to be a player here. And they're trying to come for Google in some ways.I did enjoy this quote from an executive, who said for every one point of share gain in the Search advertising market, it's a $2 billion revenue opportunity. So that gives you a sense that every little bit they gain on Google, massive revenue opportunity.But a lot of the focus was on AI. And another thing that Satya did add here, in terms of Bing, they said that the feedback that they're getting from the users that have adopted it so far has been very positive. So, they're encouraged by what they're hearing. I think it's a massive opportunity for Microsoft, and it's a big reason why the stock is up just about 20% year to date.","April 26, 2023 at 2:56 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/microsoft-alphabet-ramp-spending-ai-195608497.html,Yahoo Finance Video,0.0,0.0,0.0462594696969697,0.46827651515151514
GOOG,"Big tech finding out AI is 'becoming this anticipated hype, something very important': Analyst","Ben Emons, NewEdge Wealth Senior Portfolio Manager and Head of Fixed Income and Macro, joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss the earnings reports from Microsoft and Alphabet, the impact of AI on Big Tech, and the decline in First Republic Bank's stock.We have Ben Emons, New Edge Wealth Senior Portfolio Manager. Good to see you. So a summer rip-- that is a new one for me. Sounds good unless you read it. Looks like RIP, which could go the other direction. What's ahead for big tech after what we saw yesterday from Microsoft and Google?And to some extent, what Google and Microsoft yesterday reported was that that is going to be an important part of their business going forward. So the jump in Microsoft, particularly, today was driven by their view that they are the leader in the artificial intelligence and they're taking a real step forward. So that, I think, is behind that rip, because Microsoft has a huge weight in the NASDAQ, over 12.5%. So you can expect somewhat more outperformance from here as more news comes out of artificial intelligence and how it affects tech earnings.That seems to be the biggest fear. And that is to be seen. It's been around for a really long time. It's just a matter of how it's implemented and what it does to what is a good thing, productivity. People point back to this latest episode of AI boosting these tech shares as in we're back in the '90s of technology is upgrading and, therefore, leading to a productivity boom.That's true, then that would actually be a really positive development for the economy. So it's a mixed picture. But I think your view that, yes, the government will be very careful here in terms of having AI implement that could then affect employment.But I think these companies are in a position here to still deliver topline growth. And in a weakening environment that we're dealing with, people pay up for growth. So can you get to higher multiples here? Yes, you can.But I also think that these stocks have at least longevity, because it does show these companies can weather economic change, especially as we're going through now, which we're seeming to move more and more closer towards this point of recession.Because as much as the Fed stepped in March, the regional bank index has not really recovered. And now, the rest of stock market did, but not the regional bank shares. And in addition that those bank shares are really more closely linked to what's happening on the ground in the economy, and if it is weakening and it's going to lead to less lending, then margins are going to continue to shrink.So I think it's an ongoing story. I don't want to draw necessarily parallel exactly to what happened during 2007-2008. But there's definitely a sign here of as regional banks continue to weaken, it does point you to an economy that continues to slip. And I think that's the bigger message for investors.What will be challenging here is that the FDIC, already having stepped up quite a bit for the other deposit holders at Signature Bank and Silicon Valley, took a big hit on an insurance fund. So there's some limits on what they may be able to do in order to help out, in this case, First Republic. So it's really up in the air what will happen here.It's interesting to note, though, that it didn't have the contagion effects today as it did yesterday. And that was really because of the revelation of the earnings from First Republic showing this huge decline in deposits. Markets have digested it. But I think it will continue to be a lingering risk hanging over the markets into the summer.","April 26, 2023 at 2:36 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/big-tech-finding-ai-becoming-193618079.html,Yahoo Finance Video,0.3233333333333333,0.65,0.16743006993006995,0.4649912587412587
GOOG,Microsoft 'holding a lot of the cards' in AI-powered search war with Google,"“We look forward to continuing this journey in what is a generational shift in the largest software category, search,” Microsoft Chairman and CEO Satya Nadella said on the company’s earnings call Tuesday night.Microsoft flaunted 10% revenue growth in search, citing share gains for Bing and its Edge browser (a direct competitor to Google Chrome). Bing now has more than 100 million daily active users while daily installs of the Bing mobile app have grown four times since the launch of the AI powered version of the product two months ago.“It is a generational paradigm shift,"" Ted Mortonson, Baird technology strategist, told Yahoo Finance Live. ""I would say Microsoft is holding a lot of the cards right now.”Microsoft shares rose as much as 8.5% in intraday trading while Alphabet shares ticked slightly above the flat line in midday trading.A year ago, Microsoft didn’t mention Bing once on its earnings call. The search engine hasn’t been a growth driver for Microsoft in the past, at least not at the level that search drives the narrative for Alphabet, where “Google Search and other” accounts for more than half of the company’s revenue.Google, for its part, defended it’s long-standing search dominance throughout its call on Tuesday night, with CEO Sundar Pichai noting, “Obviously, in search, we have been using AI for a while.”Guggenheim analyst John DiFucci, who has a Sell rating on Microsoft, points out Bing’s growth as noteworthy. Bing’s growth in the quarter reversed a five-quarter downward trend, according to DiFucci.“Another line we’ve not focused on in the past, but probably should going forward is Bing,” DiFucci wrote in a note to clients. “We’d assume that if Microsoft can be an outsized beneficiary of generative AI (Chat GPT), it would show up in this line.”Among other catalysts, Microsoft's position in AI pushed DiFucci's price target on Microsoft up to $232 from $212.While ChatGPT has been seen as the consumer-facing leader in the AI arms race, Microsoft believes its ability to tie the new technology to its Azure platform could be crucial as well.Microsoft now has 10 times more Azure OpenAI service customers than last quarter, with more than 2,500 Azure OpenAI service customers, per the company’s earnings call. Azure and other cloud services revenue grew 27% in the third quarter compared to the same period a year prior. Citi estimates that AI could amount to one point of Azure’s growth in the next quarter.“(Microsoft) is almost kind of like the technology Death Star if you will,” Mortonson said. “Microsoft has incredible management that executes. In that respect, as you move into generative AI, they've been working with OpenAI for years and have a huge investment. It’s powered by Nvidia and sits on Azure. That’s a pretty big initial advantage in this next war.""Josh is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance","April 26, 2023 at 12:16 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-holding-a-lot-of-the-cards-in-ai-powered-search-war-with-google-171612487.html,Yahoo Finance,0.0,0.0,0.130985680985681,0.39355366855366863
GOOG,"Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon are the leaders in a paradigm shift toward AI, strategist says","Baird Technology Strategist Ted Mortonson joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss quarterly earnings for Microsoft and Alphabet, cloud growth, the expectations for Amazon’s quarterly earnings, and the outlook for generative AI.When I looked at these numbers, and especially zeroed in on Alphabet's numbers particularly, it was noteworthy the growth that they saw in their cloud division, as well as the profitability, even at a time where we were talking about coming into this earnings season it being in an environment of more deals scrutiny. Interested in what you make of that and what this really kind of sets forth in terms of the growth narrative that these companies have really been pitching to the Street and to customers?If you look at Microsoft-- your previous guest summed it up well-- the previous quarter, they grew 38%, they guided to 31%, and they hit that number. And that was better than feared by the Street. They guided forward Azure growth at 26% to 27%. So you're seeing that moderation. This is all before you integrate generative AI so that's a positive.As it relates to Google, I would somewhat challenge the thought process that Google is behind. They pioneered AI with DeepMind. And they just rolled out Bard. They're holding a lot of cards here. And I think to some degree, the Street may be leaning one way. These are two brilliant companies with unbelievable managements.And generative AI is gonna affect every single industry for, you know, the next decade. It's probably one of the largest technology evolutions I've seen in my 30-year career of doing technology. And as an engineer, it is a feat, not only on the silicon side but on the software side.I think what happens tomorrow with Amazon is incredibly important for the tape. Last quarter, they grew 20%. The Street has a very negative bias on their channel checks on Amazon in relationship to AWS growth. And I think this is gonna be a very important report tomorrow.Also, the Street is very, very focused, not only on AWS growth rate, but for Amazon this is a major contributor to operating margin. AWS contributed almost $5.2 billion of profitability last quarter with operating margins of 24.3%. That engine's got to keep going to fuel the investment that Amazon is doing on their core ecommerce.Are we not going to see that same effect in AWS? Does AWS not have the same kind of bolt on services for cloud that the other players do? Or could they potentially surprise to the upside, also?And I think post-Silicon Valley's failure, that smaller component now on the private side is definitely seeing some pressure. Now, with that said, you look at these three clouds-- AWS, Azure, and GCP-- they are true monopolies. They're worldwide monopolies. Outside of China, Baidu, and Alibaba, they're holding 90-plus-percent of the AI engineers. And as you move into generative AI, these three companies are going to be the leaders in a paradigm shift-- not only in search but across all industries as software changes.And Microsoft is incredibly well-positioned because of their enterprise reach. And I think Dan summed it up very, very well where you're-- when you look at Microsoft, they're already commercializing AI with what's called Copilot. And Copilot's being commercialized on the developer with GitHub. It's being commercialized on security with their E5 offering. It's through dynamics.Microsoft is actually rolling it out to the enterprise right now and I think that's their core advantage, at least in the near term.Is that still the way of thinking? Are companies looking to piecemeal together a broader kind of cloud solution for themselves? Or are they kind of picking and choosing? And if so, is there a clear winner right now among some of the largest cloud players that you're tracking?And as you look at the roadmap, it is a scary roadmap. It's almost kind of like the technology Deskstar, if you will. Microsoft is an incredibly brilliant management that executes. And in that respect, I think as you move into generative AI-- they've been working with OpenAI for years in a huge investment. OpenAI is powered by NVIDIA, it sits on Azure.That's a pretty big initial advantage in this next war. And it is a generational paradigm. So I would say, Microsoft is holding a lot of cards right now.","April 26, 2023 at 8:34 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/microsoft-alphabet-amazon-leaders-paradigm-133457680.html,Yahoo Finance Video,0.0,0.0,0.1513862652499016,0.5455411255411253
GOOG,"Microsoft, Alphabet ramp up search engine rivalry as both Big Tech companies report earnings","Yahoo Finance’s Daniel Howley joins the Live show to break down quarterly earnings for Microsoft and Alphabet.And then Activision Blizzard a spokesperson said, ""The CMA's report contradicts the ambitions of the UK to become an attractive country to build technology businesses. We will work aggressively with Microsoft to reverse this on appeal. The report's conclusions are a disservice to UK citizens who face increasingly dire economic prospects. We will assess our growth plan plans for the UK, global innovators large and small will take note that despite all its rhetoric the UK is clearly closed for business.""So really strong words there from both Microsoft and Activision Blizzard. And this deal-- this would have been the largest acquisition by Microsoft. The reason why they're doing this is twofold. They want call of duty. It's a huge franchise. Last Virgin made $1 billion days after its release. So that's a good amount of cash to be pulling in.And the other thing is this Still Nascent Cloud gaming market. And Microsoft right now is just beating the pants off of Sony, Nvidia, Nintendo's not even part of that conversation right now. They have their Xbox Cloud, the Xbox Game Pass with cloud offering. It's $14.99 a month.I have it. I love it. You get easy access to games. Look, if Microsoft is eventually able to get Call of Duty and other Activision Blizzard games it would be massive. The issue here and the FTC points this out, which is also suing to block this deal, they say that Microsoft had previously gone back on assurances that they would allow some games to be available to third parties like PlayStation when they acquired ZeniMax and their company Bethesda Softworks.There's a huge game coming out from them that was originally going to be on PlayStation. It's now not going to be on PlayStation, it's going to be an Xbox exclusive. And look, exclusives are really what matters here. If you're to sell consoles, people are going to do it based on what games they can get for them. The cloud kind of starts taking that away though. And Microsoft is aggressive as hell when it comes to the cloud. You get a Samsung TV? It's got Xbox Game Pass built in now.Bing is still not as good as Google as far as when I'm doing searching, but my vibe from the call was they took the gloves off and just cold cocked Google right there with that statement. Just like, look, we're coming for you. And you know, I think they said that what was it, every of market share they grab is $2 billion? So they're just-- if they could start chipping away at Google there then that's going to be how they do it.And Google, for its part is saying, oh yeah, we're going to add chat capabilities to search. It's coming. It's coming. We have Bard out there in test. But Microsoft is doing it, right? And that's the difference.And not only are they doing it with search with chat they're also adding it to their other services. So Google did that with their kind of workspace services, right, with Google Docs and sheets and all that. But Microsoft's adding it to cybersecurity. They're adding it to Dynamics 365. They're adding it to Microsoft 365. So it's across their stack right now that they're throwing this technology in.It makes them look like they are just crushing Google in a place that Google helped create. They're part of the reason why this transformative technology exists, right? So the fact that they're beating Microsoft, I mean, it's got to send shivers up the spines of the executives there and investors for Google.The economy is challenged right now. So Google already losing some momentum for that reason. But you have to wonder over the longer term, I mean, you tend to see ad trends shift over time. And so I wonder if search ads are going to be as important as a part of either of these companies businesses 10 years from now, for example.There was a rumor going around about that. And that would be huge. Samsung runs on Android. If you pull up search you're going to be using Google. So you know Samsung is one of the largest manufacturers of smartphones on Earth. If Microsoft can get Edge in there or Bing in there rather that would be massive for them.","April 26, 2023 at 8:21 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/microsoft-alphabet-ramp-search-engine-132109175.html,Yahoo Finance Video,0.0,0.1,0.15726138940424655,0.5689423388402978
GOOG,"Stocks move higher at the open as investors digest Microsoft, Alphabet earnings","Yahoo Finance Live’s Brad Smith breaks down how stocks are trading following the opening bell on Wednesday.Let's take a look at some of that sector activity. As we mentioned, it looks like some strong activity coming into the start of today's trade for technology. That's up by about 1.9% for that sector. At least of the 11 S&P 500 sectors, that is clearly far and away leading the pack right now. It's not even close. It's like Usain Bolt and me running after him. And XLY, consumer discretionary, that's up by about half and a percent. Then bringing up the caboose here, back to the pack, you've got health care, that's down by about 1% here. Let's also take a look at the tech heavy NASDAQ, since that was the biggest gainer here.Look at this move in Microsoft at the start of today's trade. You're seeing that higher by 7.3%, that on the back of the earnings and a positive call that they had last night. Also, interesting to track Alphabets move. And here's why, because intraday, at least out of the gate this morning, it's only up by about 2/10s of a percent. This was higher on the immediate reaction when the earnings dropped by about four-and-a-half percent and, ultimately, kind of withered away some of those gains as the call went on. And I believe, by the time the call was done, those shares were only higher by about one-and-a-quarter percent in extended trading.So here this morning, not seeing too much of a bid, it's up by about 2/10s of a percent. We'll see if it holds on to that. And no, it doesn't. It's down now by about 2/10s of a percent. Funny how things change.","April 26, 2023 at 9:11 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/stocks-move-higher-open-investors-141112306.html,Yahoo Finance Video,0.125,0.5,0.08197402597402598,0.4765800865800866

Intraday moved lower by about 2% to 4%. But in the after hours after these reports drop and even throughout the course of these earnings calls, you see Microsoft hold onto gains by about 8.8%. And then pivoting on over to Google or Alphabet, you're seeing those shares hold onto gains, but down off of some of the move higher that we had seen to the tune of about 4% earlier in that immediate reaction. But Seana, we've got to start with Microsoft here this afternoon.And it really met what the Street was looking for, that buzzword ""AI"" and how Microsoft is incorporating it into their business. It's what people wanted to hear. Satya Nadella, the executives at Microsoft really delivering on that. And it comes back to the excitement, what its fueled, Microsoft, since the start of the year. So let's get to my big takeaways.First up is the demand for AI products. They remain strong right now, at least that's according to Microsoft. They're very pleased with the engagement, the interest that they are seeing from their customers and the feedback that they are getting so far.Second up, we had the Teams usage. Now, this is something that we don't talk about as much. Because maybe it's not as sexy to talk about when we're talking about everything with Microsoft and AI and the progress that they made there.But a pretty impressive number that they put forward. Microsoft surpassing 300 million monthly active users for Teams. So an impressive milestone there for the company. And Satya saying that Microsoft continues to take market share across all of those categories.And then bringing it back to AI and the growth there, Bing. Bing continuing to take share here in the US. We had Satya is saying that they were very encouraged by the feedback that they are hearing from Bing users that Microsoft is going to continue to keep incorporating their AI capabilities. So, certainly, it's all about the AI race. That's really what has been fueling some of this tech rally that we've seen so far this year.And Satya, Brad, he did not hold back. He went after the leader, I should say, by a wide margin in search right now, Google, Alphabet. Let's take a listen to what exactly Satya had to say about that.However, I do want to pivot and get to some of the takeaways here. And what I ultimately got from the Google, the Alphabet call-- Alphabet, Google, whatever you're calling them at home. There were a few things that really stuck out to me.Number one, if we can get to these takeaways, first and foremost, it's the AI-driven opportunities in search that they're talking about here. And that's what I'm going to weave into this second point there as they're talking about the future being kind of artificial intelligence as a service. And here's specifically what they said.How different language learning models are being layered into cloud, how they're being layered into cybersecurity and workspaces, even. And so they're really kind of painting this picture of a future for a developer angle where other companies can leverage the language-learning models that they are able to build out and then sell those or license those out, similar to some of the other services that they do have as well.They talked about a year of sharpened focus. I kind of gave that a hat tip to Mark Zuckerberg or Meta Platforms, a year of efficiency. And what that sharpened focus looks like, you can imagine cost restructuring. We already heard about some of that. And even with that sharpened focus, where the growth narrative is actually pointing right now.And they spent a little bit of the time talking about cloud here and particularly where AI layered into the cloud, but also just the growth of cloud. And so that was one of the more positive sparks as that cloud business became profitable. And a lot of analysts really latching on to that particularly here.And then they talked a lot about YouTube, YouTube Shorts too. I mean, my goodness. Breaking this down in two different measures here, YouTube, they talked about the content creation and AI and how that can be layered in for creators in the future. They talked about the NFL Sunday Ticket pricing.OK, great. You're trying to get some sports viewership. Understood. And that's really where they're looking to kind of link together the living room and really competing for that living room viewership from their end users and subscribers.But here's where it got interesting and I wanted to bring this full circle on the Shorts front as well. They talked about this strong creator momentum here, saying that daily uploads, they actually rose, by channel, 80% over the course of this past year. So that is something that they were asked a little bit more about later on the call, getting some questions about monetization trends, but really only offering up that they're seeing engaging and conversion on ads across their Shorts.So that's something worth keeping an eye on. Also worth noting that the revenue for this quarter for YouTube, it actually declined year over year. So perhaps TikTok is taking a little bit of that market share. We know that the in-app purchase is huge for advertisers to really make sure that they're being able to take advantage of it as well right here. Let's also check in on some of these vibes. I've got to know, what was your vibe from this call, Seana?And they're really looking to lead this AI race. And I think that gives them a huge advantage. What about you, Brad?Because they're still waiting for some of the bets to really be monetized. On the long-term basis, we're going to see exactly how that is layered into their existing search engine, how that's layered into content creation on YouTube, and how they're able to benefit from some partnerships that they've drummed up. One of those partnerships, such partnerships is NVIDIA. Interesting to see there. And I was tracking shares of NVIDIA as well after earnings dropped for these companies and after the call started.And I mentioned on the Alphabet earnings call, you saw NVIDIA shares actually higher in after hours trading. Right now, they're higher by about 2.7% in extended hours. Taking a look at that chart. And the mention that I'm noting here, they're the only cloud provider-- Google is the only cloud provider to announce the availability of NVIDIA L4 tensor core GPUs for inference AI workloads. So that particularly benefiting NVIDIA at least here and now, as Luther Vandross would say.But we've got to keep it moving, keep it rolling along here. Let's bring in Yahoo Finance's tech editor Dan Howley to get his take on what took place between both of these calls. Dan had kind of one headphone in for Microsoft, one headphone in for Alphabet. Dan, what did you gather?And they actually had fallen back pretty significantly from when they initially announced. You know, a lot of AI talk on Microsoft's side. Google really, I think that the big thing is their continued to improvements rather at ad sales space. And, you know, sure, they're going to have to talk about AI as well.But it just still feels really like Microsoft is continuing to dominate this conversation as far as AI goes. And, you know, I just want to go real quick to what we're seeing from folks on Twitter as far as the AI aspect goes. We asked some of our readers, who is winning the race so far? And 56% so far say Microsoft.There's much more after the call to roll on. Over the course of this week, we've got more of those companies in this beloved tech landscape reporting. But for Brad Smith, for Seana Smith, and for Dan Howley, that does it for us here on the day. You've been watching ""After the Call"" live on Yahoo Finance.

GOOG,"Google: Investors will 'need to keep an eye on' longer-term search headwinds, analyst says","Roth MKM Managing Director Rohit Kulkarni joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss the surge of Google stock on Q1 earnings, growth in tech stocks, AI's role in the tech industry, and the outlook of Google's long-term investments.I think there are significantly more positive surprises in today's print than what even the stock seems to indicate. Cloud is growing. Cloud profitability is improving. They're buying back shares. Search, which people start to kind of question, that is outperforming expectations. So a lot of positives, a couple of small yellow flags. Headcount increased sequentially during the layoff a lot of people recently. So again, we'd love to hear more about cost cutting in the next couple of quarters. But I think, again, this puts to rest a lot of concerns heading into the print.So what Google as a third player is doing is also inflecting on profitability. This is the first quarter they are showing positive operating income. Again, they did reshuffle some costs here and there. That's a minor yellow flag. But I think on a reported basis they are positive on margins for the first time on the cloud. So that's an inflection quarter. So we like that and every investor would be cheering.So any innovations in search longer term, this is not a near-term headwind, but longer-term headwinds in search, be it coming from Microsoft, Chat GPT, or other sources, that is something that we need to keep an eye on. So profitability versus growth in search is something that is there at a very curious junction, if you will, as new ways of searching on the internet are emerging. And perhaps Google needs to rethink some of their longer-term investments.So I think from prioritizing long-term investments. Silicon Valley has always believed that Google is the leader in AI. Google has always done the cutting edge research and brought around new products on AI. But we are not seeing any real direct to consumer AI killer app from Google yet. So I think that's what we need to focus on, what is that AI killer app that Google can introduce in the next 3, 6, 12 months? And how can they turn the PR table into a more of a fundamental battle as such?So if they had laid off so many people yet the headcount increased sequentially quarter over quarter. So I think we need a little bit of softer headcount growth. Or in fact, we would like to see headcount to be actually declining quarter over quarter just so that the base of operating expense that Google carries forward while the revenue growth is softer, I think that goes in line. So I feel that needs to be a little bit of extra discipline from a cost standpoint. And with the revenue upside that we are seeing that would just simply put rocket ship boosters to the stock.","April 25, 2023 at 3:50 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/google-investors-keep-eye-longer-205004253.html,Yahoo Finance Video,0.0,0.0,0.056203208556149714,0.4233607079195315
GOOG,"Stocks moving in after hours: Google, Microsoft, PacWest, Visa","Yahoo Finance Live's Seana Smith looks at several stocks trending in the after-hours trading session.A bright spot in this report was its cloud growth. $7.5 billion, that's up 28% year over year. AI certainly been the buzzword so far this earnings season. It was in the second line of this earnings release. Again, you're looking at gains of just about 17% year to date.Flipping over to another tech giant and that is Microsoft. That stock up nearly 5% in extended trading. A beat there on both the top and bottom line. Cloud growth holding up better than what the Street was bracing for. You're looking at a gain just about 4.6%. When you take a look at the chart here for Microsoft that stock also moving to the upside since the start of the year, up just about 14%.Flipping over to PacWest Bancorp, the regional bank play. That stock up 21% in extended trading. Still off about 55% year to date though. Putting this all in perspective, it was about total deposits. That's dropping 17% on quarter over quarter. But some encouraging commentary here within this report.PacWest saying that deposits did stabilize in the latter part of March. They further increase by approximately 700 million as of yesterday following the quarter there. So that is exactly what investors want to hear when we talk about deposit growth and exactly what has been playing out with the regional banks following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and also most recently what we have seen in First Republic so far this week. So again, year to date stock off just about 55% in extended trading though up 21%.And rounding it out with Visa. That stock up just about 2% in extended trading here. Revenue climbing higher payment volume was a big driver here up just about 10% from a year ago. Year to date you're looking at gains of just about 10%. Over the past year similar picture with shares up just about 9%.

GOOG,"Alphabet stock rises following Q1 earnings beat, revenue beat across business segments","The Yahoo Finance Live team reports on the jump in Alphabet stock in after-hours trading following a positive Q1 earnings report.Also, checkmark, yes, you've got a beat on revenue. That came in at $69.7 billion. That's the overall revenue number, but here's what a lot of analysts focus in on is that revenue number less tac, traffic acquisition costs, and that came in by my back-of-the-envelope calculations at $58 billion here.And so continuing to look through some of the numbers, important to note for some of the different lines of business within Alphabet-- of course, this is the parent company of YouTube as well. YouTube ads in the quarter-- that came in at about $6.69 billion. That was actually a decrease year over year compared to the first quarter of 2022.So keep that in focus. We'll see what more type of color we get on the earnings call about that, and of course we'll be breaking that down after the call. But you were wondering what the company would say about artificial intelligence. It really only took them the second line in the first quote from Sundar Pichai, who is the CEO of Alphabet and Google, saying, we're pleased with our business performance in the first quarter, search performing well, momentum in Cloud, introduced important product updates anchored in deep computer science and AI.Yes, artificial intelligence, not the great 76er Allen Iverson there. So ultimately, at the end of the day, we're going to hear more about that on the call, the CFO, Ruth Porat, also adding that resilience in search and momentum in Cloud resulted in Q1 consolidated revenues of $69.8 billion. That was actually up 3% year over year.So those are some of the high-level takeaways here. It's going to be important to see what they say on the call with regard to artificial intelligence--So they've got it-- both catch up and stay ahead of the curve with regard to AI, so no surprise about their focus there. And it's interesting the note that you mentioned about YouTube because you recall that Susan Wojcicki stepped down from that. She'd been the leader of that unit for years.I mean, she was one of, basically, the OGs with the company. I mean, Google started in her basement. So it's interesting to see that there is a little bit of softness, so certainly some of that probably factoring in terms of the transition there with regard to YouTube. We'll definitely be looking out on that call for the impact with regard to AI and Bard and, of course, the job cuts that they mentioned. I mean the first heavy job cuts.When you take a look at some of these numbers here, though, it looks pretty positive here for Google given the fact that a lot of the focus was on the search business because Alphabet and its dominance that the company has had in search-- they have the most to lose with the fact that Microsoft has been gaining some traction over the last couple of months in regards to Bing and their-- how they have, I guess, woven in AI into their Bing search. That's something-- something that certainly TheStreet was bracing themselves for in this report.But search performing well, like they said in this release, and also momentum in Cloud enough to really move shares to the upside.Options AI was actually looking for a-- a post-market or after-market move after the earnings dropped by about 4.7%. On the outset of the announcement, we got roughly that at about 4%. We'll continue to track to see where shares are moving.But you mentioned Cloud a moment ago, too. I did want to come back to that because look at the growth year over year in that Cloud division. Coming in at, what, $7.4 billion-- $7.45 billion versus the $5.8 billion that they saw in the same quarter last year, you talk about the growth narratives that these companies are trying to retell to investors, to their customers.And that is evidenced when you see Google Cloud performing the way it did even in an environment where some of these deals, as we were talking about, are being more scrutinized by the customer.[INTERPOSING VOICES]","April 25, 2023 at 3:22 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/alphabet-stock-rises-following-q1-202203935.html,Yahoo Finance Video,0.0,0.1,0.08533405483405485,0.4956475468975469

GOOG,"Microsoft, Alphabet earnings: What to expect","Yahoo Finance’s Daniel Howley joins the Live show to discuss the expectations for Microsoft and Alphabet earnings.I think the big thing that people should be looking at not, necessarily talking about right now is going to be the cloud, and how the cloud continues to do. That's the profit driver, or the driver for the stock for the past few years, especially when it comes to Microsoft, Google trying to build out Google Cloud platform. They're still far behind Microsoft, still far behind Amazon.And I think that's going to be the big discussion. They moved around some of the accounting when it comes to Google Cloud. So they're trying to make that more profitable in the interim at least on paper going forward. But I think what we've seen and what we're expecting out of Microsoft for the coming quarter is a continued decline in growth, a continued, slowing of growth in the cloud.And there's a number of reasons for that, chief among them, companies cutting back on spending. And cloud is an important part of what companies have to do moving forward. It's not a market that's completely saturated yet. There's still tons of growth there.But if they can hold off at this point in time, then that's really what they're doing. I think another thing that it's on the fringes that people might still care about, but is a multibillion dollar business for Microsoft, is there more computing segment. And that's the PC sales. And they sell Windows licenses for the two third parties that sell computers. We're expecting a pretty big, substantial drop there just because people aren't buying computers at this point.I think Gartner earlier this month, it said that worldwide PC shipments dropped 30% in the first quarter. So that's going to ding Microsoft pretty hard there. I think on the Google side of things, it's going to be how is that ad market picked back up. Is it picking back up? That's YouTube ads.And any kind of commentary they're going to have on the GPT-ification we'll just say, of search, right? They have Bard. Bard is still something that you need an invite to try out. I've been playing with it not because I'm too cool. But I think it's something that we're going to have to talk about what that means for search going forward, because Microsoft's already doing that. It's pretty good. You know, I use Bing now exclusively over--The other thing is, you sit on a bus, a train, you go out with friends and family, 95% of the time, you're probably going to see them rocking one of these bad boys. Tons of androids still in use there. And I think that's something that's great for Google. They're still look, Apple is the majority in the US, not the world. The majority and the rest of the world is still Android and Google. And it will be based on pricing alone, right?So I think that's something that was really noticeable was just how Apple is this huge, dominant force here, but you have to step out of your bubble as you said. And that's really the big difference. And I think just to kind of add on to that the idea of Apple in India, when I was away, all I was getting was updates from Tim Cook on Twitter about going to India, the store opening over there. They have a long way go as far as getting any kind of traction there.

GOOG,Stocks trade lower at the open as investors digest corporate earnings,"Yahoo Finance Live’s Brad Smith breaks down how stocks are trading following the opening bell on Tuesday.That has gotten a lot of attention and a lot of discussion on the macro level even as we have the likes of a UPS, which is seen by many as a bellwether, right? It's a barometer of how much stuff is being shipped around the country and around the world, and it's seeing weakness.So you have that on the one hand, Brad. You have a lot of the other companies reporting earnings on the other hand. We keep talking about mixed economic signals. By and large, earnings, I think, are coming out ahead of where people thought they would be. But if you're trying to get the read through to economics, it still feels mixed.And particularly here looking at some of the activity out of the gate here as we're tracking the Dow Jones Industrial Average. We're flat, just barely to the downside right now. Over the past three days, we're still net higher by about 2/10 of a percent. I'll put this on a two-day view just so you can see kind of the activity over the course of yesterday, Monday, and then now as we're kind of getting into today's trading session where we may continue to trend. At least as of right now over the past two days still net higher, just barely by about 1/10 of a percent there for the Dow.NASDAQ Composite, tech-heavy average. We saw tech sputtering a little bit out of the open yesterday. NASDAQ right now, you're seeing that down by about half a percent for the tech-heavy average. The S&P 500, you're seeing that down 4/10 of a percent and over the course of the past two days down by 3/10 of a percent there.And so all of that considered, let's take a look at the 11 S&P 500 sectors here just to get a quick gander at where we may be trending, not just to start off today but as we move on throughout the rest of the day, we're going to have to make up some declines here that we've seen out of the gate in materials. Materials down one of the 1 and 1/4%. Energy, you're seeing that down by about 1.1% as well.However, staples, that the lone gainer as of right now. You're seeing that flat. Just barely to the upside. Holding on to some green there by the hair of its chinny chin chin, as we like to call it. That's a technical term.And then additionally here, XLV, you're seeing that trickle into positive territory. Health care, continue to watch that as we move on throughout the rest of today's trading session.And then let's lastly take a look at some of those mega-cap tech stocks. Earnings reports starting to come through. We're going to get, of course, later on today for some of these tech companies.

GOOG,Microsoft earnings: AI hype could take backseat to cloud growth troubles,"The tech giant reported Azure and other cloud services revenue growth of 27% year-over-year for the quarter. That number has declined every quarter since at least Q3 2022, as companies trim their capital expenses amid rising interest rates.Here are the most important numbers from the report compared to what analysts were expecting, as compiled by Bloomberg.Shares of Microsoft were up more than 4% following the announcement.“The world's most advanced AI models are coming together with the world's most universal user interface - natural language - to create a new era of computing,” Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said in a statement.“Across the Microsoft Cloud, we are the platform of choice to help customers get the most value out of their digital spend and innovate for this next generation of AI.”Microsoft helped kick off Big Tech's AI obsession with its multi-year, multi-billion dollar investment in ChatGPT developer OpenAI.And while Microsoft’s stock has seemingly benefited from both the AI hype and overall market rebound after a rough 2022, the company's main growth driver continues to be its cloud computing efforts in its Azure unit.But that growth has slowed markedly over the last year. In Q3 2022, Microsoft reported Azure growth of 46% year-over-year. But that's since fallen each quarter, landing at 27% in Q3 2023.Part of the reason for this decline was large customers pulling back on spending as higher interest rates challenged global growth. Microsoft is also contending with flagging PC sales, as demand from consumers and business customers falls from pandemic-era highs.The company reported a 9% decline in its More Personal Computing segment revenue, with Windows OEM revenue down 28%.

GOOG,Tech layoffs: Smaller companies still hiring top talent as tech giants cut jobs,"Key Video Moments:00:00:30 Bigger tech companies laying off, smaller companies still hiring00:02:02 Tech companies are ""always innovating""00:02:17 A.I. helps companies in ""re-org""00:02:50 A.I. keeps talent acquisition costs lowNow the reason behind that is while the bigger tech companies are laying off, the smaller tech companies or product companies, especially the B2B SaaS world are still hiring for top talent, top tech talent. Now they might not be hiring for hundreds and thousands of jobs, but they're definitely hiring for 7 to 10 positions every quarter. So we're still able to place a fine and place top talent for those companies.I'm also working with companies that are scaling steadily. And they might not be scaling a lot by a lot of numbers, but they're scaling enough to where they still need recruiters help to find the top talent because, again, the market is now saturated with a lot of talent. And so having recruiters like myself in my agency to really kind of figure out what the right person is for their specific company goes a long way. And then I have clients who are also hiring me to transition people off. So transitioning employees off post layoff and how to kind of secure their future as they look at other companies to join.And so where I have seen AI really come in, I mean, I'll talk about talent acquisition in a little bit, but also just the rework. So we have a client right now where they're using AI's help to do a complete company reorg just based on where the need is for their products and services and how they can potentially pivot, and so using AI to guide those strategies. So they might be laying off people from one department, but they're growing another or they're doing a complete restructure of one department. And they're telling people like, if you this is not what you want to do because your job description said differently but we are pivoting, then you are welcome to walk away. And we'll happily provide severance.From a talent acquisition standpoint, the way that companies are using AI is to just reduce talent acquisition cost. So having AI do any type of initial prescreening or reviewing or resumes or protocols so that they are not having to pay a sharp fee when a company finds someone. So they're still using the element of interviewing and prescreening internally, but then they're actually using AI to make the process a lot more streamlined and efficient.","April 24, 2023 at 12:04 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/tech-layoffs-smaller-companies-still-170446869.html,Yahoo Finance Video,0.25,0.5,0.16807081807081806,0.5348443223443223

GOOG,What is Metadata? YF explains,"Metadata is information that describes and explains data. In layman’s terms, let’s say you post a picture, that picture, even when you've taken it, already has the location that that picture was taken, the date that it was taken, and the type of camera that you were probably using. Those three things are essentially called metadata.So what is metadata? Metadata is essentially the data about data. And to break that down even further, say you post a picture. That picture, even when you've taken it, already has the location that that picture was taken at, the date that it was taken, the type of camera that you were probably using. Those three things and more amass the metadata.But here's where it comes into play for some of the social media companies, is because when you post that image, you are essentially giving that metadata over to the social media companies. And you're allowing them to then catalog some of that metadata and create an advertising profile on you that they can then index and be able to resell to other advertisers. So for social media companies, that metadata is incredibly important.There's some data that you volunteer when you sign up for a profile. But there's other data that you're giving them, not even knowing it. And that is how you get advertised to on such a granular level and why some of those ads are so relevant.

GOOG,Lyft layoffs are 'very consistent in what we've seen in big tech' cost-cutting strategies: Analyst,"D.A. Davidson Managing Director and Senior Research Analyst Tom Forte and CFRA Research Senior Equity Analyst Angelo Zino join Yahoo Finance Live to discuss recent layoffs in the tech sector and the future outlook for the industry.I think as far as Q1 earnings season is concerned here, you really need to see these companies focus at the very least beating on the bottom line side of things. And then at least kind of guide towards more of a bottom in terms of the margin side of things with a potential kind of improving forward commentary on the top line side of things as well as on the margin side of things. Clearly, the dollar is going to help in this case. You've got some Russia-Ukraine kind of headwinds over the last year where those comps are getting also a little bit more favorable as you go into the June quarter. Certain companies are also going to lap maybe some supply constraints that they witnessed in the June quarter a year ago.So I think there are some positives in terms of easier comps out there. And in terms of the forex. But at the very least, I mean you need to see execution maybe to times point in terms of the cost cuts that we've seen announced helping on the bottom line side of things. And then some at least positive indications in terms of commentary.Hopefully, they put some of those issues to rest here in terms of the quarter. But more importantly, I think you're going to see AI talked about more so for Alphabet in terms of the Google I/O Conference in May.

Ukraine’s “rightful place” is in NATO, he said there. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said a “well-deserved political invitation” should be extended to Ukraine to join NATO at the alliance’s summit in Lithuania in July, which the Ukrainian leader plans to attend.Key DevelopmentsUS Expands Hunt for Russia Sanctions Evaders to Distant PlacesUS, Ukraine Allies Consider Near-Total Ban on Exports to RussiaRussia’s Putin and Saudi Crown Prince Discuss OPEC+ CooperationRussian Arms Sales to India Stall Due to Fears Over US Sanctions(All times CET)Ukraine Says YouTube Removes Wagner Group Videos (4:54 p.m.)YouTube removed videos posted by members of Russia’s Wagner Group, whose mercenaries fight alongside Moscow’s regular forces, Ukrainian Culture Minister Oleksandr Tkachenko said on his Telegram channel.Two Thirds of EU Fund for Ammo Stocks Used Up: Borrell (3:57 p.m.)European countries have sought reimbursements worth more than two-thirds of the EU’s 1 billion euros set aside for stocks of ammunition to send to Ukraine, the bloc’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said on Twitter.In addition, countries have already given advanced warning they would request another 200 million euros (219 million) in reimbursements, meaning the package is close to being used up, according to a senior EU official.Separately, while the EU already signed off on plans in March to use another 1 billion euros to jointly procure ammunition, the effort has stalled in technical talks as diplomats seek to spell out the legal language of the text. In particular, the question of whether non-EU companies can benefit has nagged negotiators. The text should be finalized in the coming days, the EU official said.US Expands Hunt for Russia Sanctions Evaders to Distant Places (3:20 p.m.)The US Justice Department is looking for new ways to cut off Russian sanctions evasion by focusing on overseas investment advisers, hedge funds, law firms and private equity managers that have previously escaped scrutiny.“People who are sitting in banks where they don’t care about US sanctions or money laundering or frankly fraud concerns, fit the bill when I say we are prioritizing facilitators,” Andrew Adams, head of the department’s Task Force Kleptocapture, told Bloomberg in an interview this week.Adams’s remarks can be seen as a warning shot about the expanding US campaign to flush out sanctions evaders. They also underscore a perennial problem: law enforcement has struggled to crimp the ability of wealthy Russians and companies to conceal their money.Ukraine, Poland and Germany to Set up Leopard Repair Center (3:09 p.m.)Ukraine and Poland signed a letter of intent to create a center to service Leopard 2 main battle tanks that have been given to Ukraine, Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov said.

The supplies would help sustain weapons systems already sent to Kyiv.“Sometimes we underestimate all the logistics that have to be in place just to have operational battle tank capabilities,” Stoltenberg said. “Maybe it’s a bit more boring, but logistics is extremely important. This is now a battle of attrition and a battle of attrition becomes a war of logistics.”The NATO chief’s trip to Ramstein follows a visit to Kyiv on Thursday, where he met with Zelenskiy. Stoltenberg said Zelenskiy had accepted his invitation to join the July 11-12 NATO summit in Vilnius , and that they had discussed preparations for the meeting, including plans for allies to agree to a multiyear package to help Ukraine modernize its armed forces.Russia Accidentally Strikes City Near Ukraine Border (8:30)A Russian warplane accidentally fired on the city of Belgorod, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) north of the Ukrainian border, Tass reported, citing the defense ministry.“As a Sukhoi Su-34 air force plane was flying over the city of Belgorod, there was an accidental discharge of aviation ammunition,” Tass reported, citing the defense ministry.An unspecified number of buildings were damaged, the state-run Tass news service reported, citing the ministry. Local authorities reported at least three injuries. The regional governor said on Telegram said the bomb left a 20-meter-wide (66 feet) crater on a main street.Russian Equipment in ‘Dreadful State’: Germany (8:30 a.m.)Some of the materiel the Kremlin is resupplying its forces in Ukraine with is in “a dreadful state” and “literally from the stone age,” said Pistorius, citing tanks he said were from the 1950s and 60s.At the same time, it’s difficult to make an accurate assessment of Russia’s capacity to produce more modern equipment, which makes it all the more important that allies continue to support the government in Kyiv, above all with air-defense systems like the Patriot, Pistorius told public broadcaster ZDF. Germany this week delivered a Patriot to Ukraine and has also supplied the advanced IRIS-T air-defense system.Mud Season in Ukraine is Slowing Operations on Both Sides, UK Says (8 a.m.)Soft ground conditions across much of Ukraine “is highly likely slowing operations for both sides of the conflict,” the UK defense ministry said, adding that surface conditions should improve in the next few weeks.“Russian online outlets are likely exaggerating the overall impact of mud on Ukrainian forces as part of an information operation aimed at raising Russian morale, and undermining Ukraine’s supporters, in light of an anticipated Ukrainian counter offensive,” the ministry said in a Twitter thread.Ukraine Shoots Down Russian Drones (8 a.m.)Ukraine’s air defense shot down eight out of 10 Iranian-made loitering “Shahed-136” drones launched by Russia overnight at infrastructure cargoes, its General Staff said.Drones hit some civilian infrastructure in Ukraine’s central Poltava region and air defenses were also working in the Kyiv region, local authorities said on their Telegram channels.It was a second consecutive night of drone attacks, after 10 of 11 of the UAVs were downed the previous night.Zelenskiy Says He Expects NATO Invitation at July Summit (12:11 a. m.)Ukraine wants to get an invitation to join NATO in July, when the military alliance’s summit is held in Lithuania, Zelenskiy said.“Neither the majority of Ukrainians, nor the majority of Europeans, nor the majority of the inhabitants of the entire NATO space, will understand” if a “well-deserved political invitation” isn’t offered in Vilnius, Zelenskiy said late Thursday in his daily video address. “Ukraine did everything to ensure that our application was approved.”Zelenskiy also repeated a call for Russian athletes to be banned from the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris. “It is obvious that a terrorist state will do everything to justify itself through sports or to use the international Olympic Movement to support its aggression,” he said.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekTikTok’s Algorithm Keeps Pushing Suicide to Vulnerable KidsHow a Brazen Plot to Rig Oil Auctions Cost Venezuela BillionsSprite Is So Popular That Pepsi Launched a New Lemon-Lime WarThe Nord Stream Explosion Remains an Unsolved Mystery Gripping EuropePeak Gas Has Passed, and Higher Prices Might Be Next©2023 Bloomberg L.P.","April 21, 2023 at 9:58 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ukraine-latest-russia-accidentally-bombs-070022828.html,Bloomberg,0.5,0.9,0.027419050316246567,0.3837218337218338

And then I would expect tech to continue to perform well.","April 18, 2023 at 1:00 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/tech-stocks-perform-fed-pauses-180054321.html,Yahoo Finance Video,0.0,0.0,-0.05972222222222223,0.4375
GOOG,Nine states join DOJ lawsuit to breakup Google's ad tech tool stranglehold,"“We look forward to litigating this important case alongside our state law enforcement partners to end Google’s long-running monopoly in digital advertising technology markets,” Doha Mekki, principal deputy assistant attorney general for the Justice Department’s antitrust division, said in a statement.The Justice Department and attorneys general allege that Google's suite of online ad tech tools — technology to buy, sell and serve ads online — prevents competitors from entering the market and blocks publishers from monetizing their own content. The department further claims that Google should be required to divest a host of entities that allow it to carry out the allegedly offending behavior.The DOJ wants Google to divest, at the least, its Google Ad Manager suite, including both Google’s publisher ad server, DFP, and Google's ad exchange, AdX.""Google’s anticompetitive behavior has raised barriers to entry to artificially high levels, forced key competitors to abandon the market for ad tech tools, dissuaded potential competitors from joining the market, and left Google’s few remaining competitors marginalized and unfairly disadvantaged,"" the complaint states.The suit goes on to allege that Google is using its outsized market share to take supra-competitive profits for itself.The January lawsuit came more than two years after the Justice Department and a group of state attorneys general joined in a separate antitrust suit alleging that Google's search and search advertising businesses violate U.S. antitrust laws.The company controls some of the most important links in the online advertising chain — specifically its DoubleClick platform, a premier tool for online publishers, helping them create, manage, and track online marketing campaigns.In the first three quarters of 2022, Google's ad tech division generated $24.3 billion in sales. As for Google’s share of the US publisher ad server market, the Justice Department alleges that Google's market share has remained above 90% for ""many years.""Google has for years also faced scrutiny from domestic and overseas lawmakers and regulators concerning its dominance across online and mobile markets.In the U.S., the firm has faced investigations by the DOJ, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, and state attorneys general over suspicions that the company’s search and digital advertising businesses operate as illegal monopolies.In 2021, dozens of attorneys general sued the company, alleging that it was operating illegal monopolies in the market for Android app distribution by imposing technical barriers that prevent third parties from distributing apps outside the Play Store.Over a decade ago, the company was fined roughly $10 billion (8.6 billion euros) by the European Commission, the European Union’s antitrust watchdog. Those fines resulted from three separate antitrust violations alleged by the Commission.In 2017, the company was hit by the Commission for allegedly abusing its market dominance in search, and again in 2018 for allegedly abusing its market power in the mobile space by preloading its own apps on new Android phones. And in 2019, the company was again fined for limiting its rivals from working with companies that already had deals with Google’s AdSense platform.Click here for the latest technology business news, reviews, and useful articles on tech and gadgetsRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance","April 18, 2023 at 9:49 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nine-states-join-doj-lawsuit-to-breakup-googles-ad-tech-tool-stranglehold-144923381.html,Yahoo Finance,0.0,0.0,0.05426877470355731,0.3951712779973649
GOOG,Tech's new AI war is actually about search: Morning Brief,"This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can receive in your inbox every Monday to Friday by 6:30 a.m. ET along with:The chart of the dayWhat we're watchingWhat we're readingEconomic data releases and earningsIt seems almost every tech story these days is about the power, possibility, and danger of artificial intelligence.And while the potential of AI often seems boundless in the way its biggest boosters present, the near-term business implications of AI are actually focused on one of tech's most entrenched and profitable products — search.Reports suggesting 12% of a business's revenue is at risk rarely sit well with investors. Even if these deals are extended, the subtext is that renewals may come with terms more favorable to the device makers.That Google's future profits from search might decline, of course, is not entirely new to investors. Two months ago, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella plainly stated this was going to be the industry's future.But the challenge to Google's Search business is only superficially taking place at the negotiating table. The bigger, more technical challenge is coming from AI.One assumes the executive team at Samsung has seen this report as well.But turning ""Googling"" into ""Binging"" will take more than offering favorable revenue sharing agreements, new software upgrades, or corporate investments.In the modern tech order, the strongest moat any company or service can build is to become a verb. When people talk about looking up information on their computer or phone, in most cases they don't say they're searching — they're Googling. Google's vice grip on the search market has centered on this branding.Threats to Google's search dominance, of course, aren't unique to 2023. The magic of the industry's hottest social network — TikTok — is that search is largely replaced with discovery. Search is also at the heart of Amazon's online shopping portal, and Meta's Facebook and Instagram platforms. Every search query done by users on these platforms is a search not done on Google.But when people talk about anything AI-related, they usually don't reference LLMs or AGI or Bard. Instead, they say ""ChatGPT.""Whether AI turns out to be the paradigm-defining technology the tech world believes remains to be seen.

GOOG,Google 'remains the leader in AI' despite lack of direct-to-consumer offerings: Analyst,"Roth MKM Managing Director Rohit Kulkarni joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss Samsung's decision to consider Microsoft's AI-powered Bing to replace Google Search for all of its devices, while also commenting on Google's position in the tech landscape amid artificial intelligence trends.Let's discuss what this means for the future of Google and the tech industry with Roth MKM Managing Director, Rohit Kulkarni. Rohit, thanks so much for joining us. We're looking at shares of Alphabet, which are down right now. So what would the impact to Google be if Samsung pairs up with Microsoft's Bing?What happens if Apple starts to negotiate or renegotiate the contract, which they have similar to what Samsung has? What happens if other companies start to do that? Say Firefox, Mozilla, and so on and so forth where Google search has been the primary gateway to all browsers across mobile and desktop. So that's where the big debate is. And that's what's being kind of priced into the stock via lower or a more negative sentiment I feel.So the point is I feel Google remains the leader in AI. The perception has changed simply because they haven't unlocked direct to consumer use cases, direct to consumer apps that are sexy and cool for people to tinker with like ChatGPT has. And that's where they are behind this PR campaign that probably they need to be more aggressive with. Yesterday's interview with the CEO was OK. I think they can definitely do better I would say.And then when it comes to Google's own PR, I feel they are behind the eight ball, as you just said, is what products can they directly bring to market with exclusively AI-first, native AI applications? And let consumers play around with them. It could be image generation. It could be video generation. It could be chat. It could be a lot of those things. I think they just need to kind of, I would say, unlock their AI kimono in a way that people get confidence that Google is actually the leader in AI research and products. Right now, that's on shaky grounds.Again, each of those companies have their own issues going on. But I would say if asked, what is my order right now? I would say all is equal. Amazon, then Google, and then Facebook in terms of preference of the mega caps.","April 17, 2023 at 3:13 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/google-remains-leader-ai-despite-201345816.html,Yahoo Finance Video,0.0,0.0,0.15241265468538195,0.5137325637325637

Understand that both the left and the right brain have to work together. You have to understand how the technology works, but also have read some Shakespeare. And if you can focus on the convergence of the technology and the tools with the applied side of what you need to get ahead in life, whether it's understanding business or a specific market or being a great doctor, then you'll be in a great spot no matter what happens with the technology.One thing that we started to do that I get a kick out of is if you remember when you're in college those old blue books, those just pieces of-- those little notebooks with like 20 pages in them. I've stopped having students do finals online just because there's so much cheating and so much ability for these students to just copy and paste the right answers in.

GOOG,Google stock drops about 3% amid concerns about AI competitiveness,"Search has been at the center of Google's business for more than two decades and, in the past, Google's AI credibility would have been hard to question. However, the company has struggled over the last few months to prove that it has what it takes to move AI search into its future — and subsequently, people are beginning to take competing search engines more seriously.There is, of course, still a long way to go for Bing to hit the heights of Google Search, which still processes billions of searches each day. However, investors keep asking — and today's stock drop is the latest iteration of this — why it seems like they're falling behind.It's a question that Needham analyst Laura Martin has been asking for months, most recently in an April 3 note: ""The hardest question we get from investors is: How could any company launch a consumer-facing AI product before GOOGL, given its AI lead? GOOGL has about 130,000 FTEs, 30,000 software engineers globally, and 10,000 AI engineers making an average of $200,000 each, according to Glassdoor ...

They are going to listen to whatever is going on in the room. They have little pictures of the years. So AIs are being trained on us, right? The easiest way to regulate AIs and to change what AIs do is to change what we do, right? So if our values are, let's extract value from people in places as rapidly as possible. Let's take away people's rights, whether they know it or not, in order to get more money out of them, then that's what AIs are going to learn.That is the data set. That's the learning model. So then no matter how we're regulating them, those are the values that they're going to take in. But I think what we have to start doing now is look at, well, if we now have tools that are going to accelerate whoever and whatever we are, then what do we want to be, right?

GOOG,Lone Amazon bear optimistic on company's A.I. efforts,"While nearly all analysts are bullish on Amazon's prospects, one is decidedly bearish.Slowinski says Amazon will be successful with A.I., but ultimately says it’s “not yet clear” as to how the company is going to use generative A.I. in its consumer services.Key Video Takeaways:0:00:16 - Amazon will be successful with A.I.0:01:08 - Wall Street focuses on three things with AmazonI think that's what we saw them announce yesterday. We're not yet quite clear as to how Amazon is going to use generative AI in their own Amazon consumer services. So I still think that's to come. So this is an exciting space.I think Microsoft, through their OpenAI relationship; Google, just like Amazon, have their own capabilities; and Amazon will all be successful. But I think near-term, the market's focused on three things. One is, what's the cost? So we may not see revenue just yet, but will we see a tick up in CapEx as this move toward generative AI accelerates? And of course, for Amazon, people are sort of looking more for CapEx cuts and not CapEx increases.The second one is, what is the product opportunity? I think with Microsoft, people see Microsoft 365, GitHub Copilot, and some other announcements they've made of real opportunities near-term for them to begin to monetize it. We've seen some other partners, like Salesforce with their GPT offering, Intuit now with Mailchimp, looking to monetize this through products.And then the third, of course, is the platform opportunity, like I just mentioned with AWS, Google Cloud platform, Microsoft Azure, providing this technology to enterprise customers to bring their data onto their platforms, use these large language models to begin to train their own AI initiatives. So I think all three companies will be beneficiaries of that over time.","April 14, 2023 at 4:50 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/lone-amazon-bear-optimistic-companys-215044886.html,Yahoo Finance Video,0.0,0.0,0.29523809523809524,0.5997354497354498

GOOG,Google and Microsofts AI services give very different answers on investing: Analyst,"DataTrek Research Co-Founder Jessica Rabe breaks down the potential for artificial intelligence services to give out investing advice, differences between Google Bard and ChatGPT answers, and how regulators may be expected to respond.To discuss, we're joined by DataTrek Research Co-Founder Jessica Rabe. Jessica, thank you for joining me. So a lot of people want to sort of go straight into the races when it comes to generative AI. But you have to kind of take it with a grain of salt in terms of how you expect it to be used when it comes to Wall Street and banking and-- and financial advice. What are your big takeaways there?ChatGPT could not be further off. It said that US stocks, or the S&P 500 in particular, rallied 27% last year and was actually up for the fifth year in a row. Well, obviously stocks had a very poor 2022. And even if stocks were up last year, it would have only been the fourth straight positive year in a row, not the fifth, because US equities are actually down on a total return basis in 2018.Now, Bard was more accurate. Bard said that the S&P 500 had a bad year. It was down 19.4% last year, and that was correct. However, it didn't decipher that was on a price return basis, not a total return basis. But even still, more accurate than ChatGPT.So that just goes to show that, yes, it's an interesting technology if investors want to use it in their investment process and see how the technology develops over time. We certainly understand that. However, you really have to do your homework. And you really have to fact check their answers because their accuracy can be spotty.Bard, however, is very willing to give recommendations. So, for example, when we asked, what stocks do you think will outperform in Q2, Bard gave five names as well as a couple of sentences as to why. They are all big tech. We would point out, though, however, that Alphabet was on the list. Now, of course, Alphabet owns Bard, so we don't think SEC regulators would look too fondly on Bard recommending the stock of its parent company, especially having not disclosed the relationship.Another thing we asked was, which stocks do you think will underperform in Q2? And Bard also gave five names for that. However, another thing we found curious was it included Cruise on the list and gave the symbol CCL and referred to it as an electric vehicle company. Now, Cruise is, of course, an electric vehicle unit of GM. But CCL, the symbol, is actually Carnival, the cruise line. So very-- very different companies.","April 13, 2023 at 3:37 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/google-microsoft-ai-services-very-203715663.html,Yahoo Finance Video,0.0,0.78,0.05116396103896104,0.4871304112554113

AAPL,13 Apps That Will Pay You Just To Go on a Walk,"But did you know you can make money doing it?You might be wondering “How can I get paid for walking?” or “What app pays the most for walking?” There are many walking apps that will reward you for your steps — and, in some cases, other types of exercise — with charitable donations, discounts, gift cards and more. How’s that for even more motivation to get moving? But before you lace up your sneakers, download one of these apps and get rewarded for walking.You can also get points for logging food, weighing yourself, meditating and tracking your sleep. You can get six points each for up to five activities.Healthcare partners like the American College of Cardiology Foundation, Merck, Lilly and the Digital Medicine Society are working with Evidation to conduct research on the app, so users have the option to participate in research studies and surveys. You’ll earn points for this as well.Once you’ve accrued 10,000 points, you can redeem them for a $10 reward. You can also donate your reward to charity.Charity Miles is an app that pays you to walk. More than that, it lets you turn your walking, running or biking miles into charitable donations. You need to be sponsored, either by friends and family, by the corporate sponsor(s) of your charity, by companies that sponsor their employees through Charity Miles’ Employee Empowerment Program or by Charity Miles’ corporate sponsorship fund.Charity Miles has a large group of charities you can choose from to receive donations from the miles you walk, run or bike. There are health-related charities, like the Alzheimer’s Association, Back on My Feet, the Crohn’s and Colitis Foundation, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, March of Dimes and more. There are also other charities like the World Wildlife Federation, Habitat for Humanity and the ASPCA.Some challenges are for weight loss, but if you’re just looking to increase your steps, there are walking challenges too. And you can create a challenge of your own if you have a group of people who want to sign up.Paceline rewards you for having active minutes as determined by your Apple Watch, Garmin or Fitbit. When you are moving and your heart rate is elevated, you are accruing active minutes. The goal is to have 150 active minutes per week, but no more than 50 per day will be counted. The idea here is that you want to be active throughout the week, so you can’t just load up on the active minutes on Saturday if you’ve spent the rest of the week on the couch.StepBet lets you bet on yourself to reach your fitness goals. You place a bet — amounts can vary, but $40 is a common bet — on a specific game. Most games last for six weeks. You select your source of steps, and the app calculates your goal based on your historic data. Depending on the game, your goal may stay the same for all six weeks, or it may gradually increase. You’ll have Active and Power Goals, and you’ll need to meet both of them.StepBet takes 15% of the bets placed off the top, but they guarantee that you won’t lose money if you reach your goal. So even if everybody reaches their goal, you’ll still get at least your original bet back.Winwalk is another app that pays you to walk. If you’re looking for a basic pedometer, Winwalk will track your steps and reward you with gift cards when you reach your step goals. This app is for Android phones only and offers no frills, no bells and whistles — you just walk and win gift cards.This app doesn’t put money in your pocket, but it does donate to charity based on your steps. Join the National Walking Challenge that starts in January and walk 10,000 steps a day for 100 days — that’s 500 miles! Support any of the available charities and raise money while you walk.With the Miles app, you’ll automatically earn points for every walk you take. Miles can be redeemed for gift cards, donations, raffles, and other products and services from brands like Walmart, Starbucks, Target, Sam’s Club and Amazon.Track your walks with the Paidtogo app to earn cash rewards. You can earn up to 10 cents per mile and up to $75 per month just for your steps. The is subscription based, so you do have to walk to make the membership fees worth it. You can buy in with a monthly, quarterly or yearly subscription.Sweatcoin is a free app that allows you to earn coins for your steps, which you can then redeem for goods and services, or donate to charity. Available goods and services include iPhones, Apple Watches, yoga classes and moreDownloading an app that pays you to walk won’t make you rich. In fact, you should probably count on keeping your day job. But if it’s a little extra motivation you’re looking for — if you need that extra push to go for a walk or jog when you really don’t feel like it — one of these apps might provide just the incentive you need to get and stay fit. And the gift card or discount is really just a bonus.More From GOBankingRatesHouses in These Cities Are Suddenly BargainsGet Top Travel Tips To Help You Save More3 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000Have a Favorite Small Business?

AAPL,Weekly Stock List,"Innovation may be hard to define but, to borrow from former U.S. Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart, you know it when you see it. The United States economy is full of innovation. It has to be. Manufacturing industries that dominated the economy decades ago - textiles, televisions, even automobiles, to a large degree - have moved overseas, where costs are lower. Yet the U.S. economy is at its largest point in history and still growing. If U.S. corporations weren't innovating, creating new products and services, and moving into new markets and applications, the domestic economy would be contracting, not expanding, and capital would not be flooding into the country. Particularly at this juncture of the market and economic cycles, when uncertainty is high due to high inflation and rising interest rates, we look to innovative companies to successfully navigate the challenges. At Argus, an 88-year-old independent research firm that has innovated a time or two in its long history, we have focused on four types of innovative companies: Industry Disruptors; First to Market; New Product Specialists; and Product & Process Perfectors. Here are some examples of companies, featured in our Innovation Theme Model Portfolio.","May 8, 2023 at 9:17 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/m/9946d764-2d7e-382a-9319-356b40cc3e4f/weekly-stock-list.html,Argus Research,0.0,0.0,0.14966883116883117,0.45902705627705637

AAPL,Top analyst says the lions share of tech layoffs are now in the rearview mirror on the heels of Apple CEO Tim Cooks declaration,"Good morning,When Apple CEO Tim Cook talks, everyone else listens.Apple has a “unique perch and perspective around consumer demand globally, and what this means for the path looking forward,” Wedbush analysts wrote in a May 1 note. So the company’s performance and practices, including Cook's current stance on mass layoffs, hold weight. In addition, Apple has more flexibility because the company has been more prudent in hiring than its peers like Meta, Google, and Amazon which have laid off thousands of employees.“Apple did not hire at the 1980s rock-star-like pace of hiring we saw from Google, Amazon, Meta, and others during the last few years,” Ives explains. “Now, Apple and Cook are in a position to gain market share and hire talent, which is a shot across the bow at the rest of the tech space.""“Layoffs are definitely a confession of poor management,” Jeffrey Pfeffer, a professor of organizational behavior at Stanford Business School, told Colvin. Pfeffer’s reasoning is that “research shows that generally, layoffs don’t improve a company’s fortunes,” Colvin writes. “Quite the opposite: They don’t reliably raise a company’s profits or stock price, but they do reliably reduce remaining employees’ morale, commitment, productivity, and trust.”Are there difficult moments when layoffs are the best of bad options? “The evidence seems pretty clear that except for really unusual situations—the company is about to go under, it’s the start of the Great Recession—large layoffs actually seem to hamper the ability to restart when things improve,” Peter Cappelli, a management professor at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, told Colvin.Looks like Cook, at least, has done his homework on that front.","May 8, 2023 at 6:01 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-analyst-says-lion-share-110150460.html,Fortune,0.5,0.5,0.11309523809523814,0.4936507936507937

AAPL,This week in tech: A banner week for Apple; whiplash for AMD,"By Louis JuricicInvesting.com -- Here is your weekly Pro Recap on the past week's most momentous tech headlines: Solid earnings out of Apple and Square, a whipsaw week for AMD, soft guidance from Qualcomm, and a narrower loss than expected at Coinbase.On Thursday Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) topped first-quarter estimates with earnings per share of $1.54 vs. the $1.43 average analyst estimate, driven by stronger-than-expected iPhone sales.Apple also boosted its dividend and announced a $90 billion share buyback program.Goldman Sachs raised the price target to $209 per share on Buy-rated AAPL stock after ""strong"" results:""We gain confidence in our Buy rating and believe AAPL shares continue to be attractive.""KeyBanc also hiked the price target, to $180 per share from the prior $177, noting that Emerging Markets strength a the tech giant offloaded weaker U.S. results.Shares were up more than 2% for the week.Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) reported a better-than-expected Q1 on Tuesday but issued disappointing guidance, triggering a 9% selloff in the shares in the next session.BofA cut the stock to Neutral from Buy, citing a ""range of headwinds"" including ""aggressive pricing/promotion pressure from main rival Intel (NASDAQ:INTC).""Citi, for its part, raised the price target on AMD stock to $85 per share, and BMO highlighted the company's continued market share gains against Intel.Then, on Thursday afternoon, shares clawed most of their way back following a story from Bloomberg that said Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is helping finance AMD’s expansion into AI chips.Microsoft and AMD have teamed to create an alternative to Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) processors for artificial intelligence, the report said, citing people with knowledge of the matter. Microsoft will provide financial support to bolster AMD’s efforts, as it works with the chipmaker on a homegrown Microsoft processor for AI workloads.AMD shares were ultimately off about 1% for the week.Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) shares slid after the company forecasted far lower-than-anticipated results for is fiscal third quarter: The company expects 3Q23 EPS in the range of $1.70-$1.90, compared with the consensus of $2.20, and revenue in the range of $8.1-8.9B, compared to the consensus of $9.25B.Q2 earnings of $2.15 per share were in line with expectations.The company said demand for smartphones had deteriorated as China remains weak, calling the macroeconomic environment ""challenging.""Deutsche called the guidance ""disappointing by any measure"" but also believes the company ""should be an attractive beneficiary of the eventual cyclical rebound once one actually occurs (not a matter of if, but rather when).""Shares sank more than 7% for the week.Block (NYSE:SQ) shares initially bumped higher after the fintech name reported better-than-expected Q1 results: earnings per share of $0.40 vs. Wall Street's estimate of $0.35, and above-par revenue of $4.99 billion.For the full year, the company raised its full-year adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) forecast to $1.36 billion, up from the prior $1.3B.Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan were both positive on the stock after earnings. JPMorgan sees more room for further upside, calling its operating leverage potential ""underappreciated by the market."" It added, ""SQ remains one of our favorite ideas.""For the week, though, shares slipped 2.5%.Coinbase's Q1 results were better than feared, driven by cost cuts and a jump in subscription revenue: The company lost just $0.34 per share, far better than expectations for $1.39 in the red.After its Thursday report, shares were trading about 9% higher.Looking ahead, the company said it expected subscription and services revenue to fall in the second quarter. For the full year it continues to seek to improve full-year 2023 adjusted EBITDA in absolute dollar terms versus full-year 2022.BofA said the results were solid but that big fundamental questions remain unanswered about the company, and maintained its Underperform rating on Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN): ""We continue to think retail crypto volumes will remain weak and the regulatory overhang will linger for some time,"" the analyst said in a note.Barclays lowered the price target to $61 from $74 per share. The analyst highlighted an uplift in retail take rate, while also noting that this trend may not prove to be sustainable.Senad Karaahmetovic and Davit Kirakosyan contributed to this report.Related ArticlesThis week in tech: A banner week for Apple; whiplash for AMDBinance resumes Bitcoin withdrawals after temporary closure4 big deal reports: More tremors across regional banks","May 7, 2023 at 12:07 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/week-tech-banner-week-apple-170723589.html,Investing.com,0.0,0.0,0.11254545454545456,0.47724242424242425

AAPL,Berkshire Hathaway: What you need to know from the annual shareholders meeting,"The annual shareholders meeting took place just days after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates by 0.25% to a new 16-year high above 5% .Key Moments:00:02:43 breakdown of Buffett’s comments on banking00:04:00 analyzing what Buffett and Munger said on AI00:05:54 what Buffett and Munger said about “value investing”[MUSIC PLAYING]A banking crisis, a slowing economy, geopolitical tensions, accelerated digital transformation with AI and a lot more, it's all on the agenda today. We're breaking down the big news from today's meeting and what's happening to the markets and your money.Brian Sozzi of Yahoo Finance here with Yahoo Finance's head of news, Myles Udland. And Myles and I, along with all of these people, are streaming out of the CHI Health Center in Omaha, Nebraska, have been ingesting hours and hours of Warren Buffett's insights into the economy and stocks alongside his right-hand man, Vice Chair Charlie Munger. And of course, we have a lot of takeaways.But let's start with three from this really celebration of capitalism, as those Berkshire shareholders love to call it. First off, the big banks, everybody in this room was waiting, Myles, to hear from Buffett on his views on the banks. Of course, First Republic now owned by JP Morgan, Buffett really not disappointing. Out of all the bank stocks that he talked about and the sector itself, he said he liked Bank of America, which he owns 13% of.And I think, you know, Sozzi, it brings me back to that weekend where the bank is seized by regulators Friday morning. And everyone's thinking what's going to happen over the weekend. Ultimately FDIC comes out. They say we're going to backstop these.And throughout the proceedings there were a couple of questions in this direction. And I think Buffett's takeaway is that effectively all deposits in the US are now backstopped.And he mentioned how sticky are deposits now, because did the whole wind-up. You don't have to stand in line to take him out of a bank. You can just go on your phone and pull your money. Obviously a dynamic that we saw with the Fed's report and the FDIC's report a couple of weeks ago is what happened at Silicon Valley Bank.What has been happening in the sector is people are wondering who is next. But really I think from Buffett's view, there's just a perception right now that you do not know for sure for sure what the business of a bank exactly looks like.And they're just like, I mean, we have robots, you know. Robots are fine. And also in this section, too, I think it's the first time of many times where we got to what if he references to nuclear weapons.And I think that to use Munger's exact quote, my advice to value investors is get used to making less money. And you see the folks kind of behind us here certainly this morning teeming into the building, you know, people in sport coats and khakis, value types. I overheard quite a few conversations on my way in to that effect.And they weren't just trying to give some encouragement to the crowd. And this is where we kind of got to a Warren zinger, perhaps, where your biggest opportunity as an investor, value or otherwise, is other people doing dumb things.But that also got into really what I think Apple has become the most instructive holding within Berkshire's portfolio. They pay a huge dividend. So every quarter, they're getting hundreds of millions-- they're getting $100 million check, or it's not, it's much larger than that. But nine figure check coming to Berkshire Hathaway.Second thing, they buy back a lot of stock. So Berkshire's holdings in Apple, its percentage of the company that it owns, has gone up organically over time. We saw the announcement on Thursday night from Apple increasing the size of that buyback authorization.So it's going to continue to go up. And it led to this discussion of how much Apple do you really own. And you look at the equity portfolio, it's out 40%. And Buffett was like, it's not 40%. We own a bunch of other stuff, See's Candies, Garanimals, got tons of runs in a kid's clothing brand. Tons of run today. But basically being like we're not 35% Apple, because our equity holdings are only a small chunk of the whole Berkshire family.So whether you're selling Coca-Cola or you're selling iPhones, it hits all those criteria. And whatever generation you want to call any company, any company coming from, Buffett's going to like those characteristics.To me he sounded surprised this event. He did not come out and say, you know, Bob Bakish is a phenomenal manager. Of course that's the CEO of Paramount. He didn't do it. He didn't do it.You're trying to shore up your capital position. You can't give it back to your owners basically. So I'll be interested to see what happens with that position. It kind of is a small part of the Berkshire equity portfolio, kind of came up-- I won't say out of nowhere, he has a long history investing in the media business, but all of a sudden it's a bunch of Paramount. Now he owns 93 million shares of the company.And so we get into the conversation about the streaming wars. And I thought his comments on your eyeballs were quite hilarious.But that's it for yours truly and Myles Udland. And we're going to get back and get some air conditioning. It's a little warm here in Omaha, Nebraska.

AAPL,"Buffett addresses stake in Apple, Occidental Petroleum, and issues warning about the streaming business","“Apple is not 35% of Berkshire's portfolio… it just happens to be a better business than any business we own.”But that also got into really what I think-- Apple has become the most instructive holding within Berkshire's portfolio. They pay a huge dividend. So every quarter, they're getting hundreds of-- they're getting $100 million check, or it's not-- it's much larger than that. But nine-figure check coming to Berkshire Hathaway.Second thing, they buy back a lot of stock. So Berkshire's holdings in Apple, its percentage of the company that it owns, has gone up organically over time. We saw the announcement on Thursday night from Apple increasing the size of that buyback authorization. So it's going to continue to go up.And it led to this discussion of how much Apple do you really own? And you look at the equity portfolio. It's about 40%. And Buffett was like, it's not 40%. We own a bunch of other stuff, See's Candies. Garanimals got tons of runs today, kids clothing brand, tons of run today.But basically being like we're not 35% Apple because our equity holdings are only a small chunk of the whole Berkshire family.And whatever generation you want to call any company coming from, Buffett's going to like those characteristics.To me, he sounded surprised at this event. He did not come out and say, Bob Bakish is a phenomenal manager. Of course, that's the CEO of Paramount. He didn't do it. He didn't do it.So I'll be interested to see what happens with that position. It kind of-- it's a small part of the Berkshire equity portfolio. It kind of came up-- I don't want to say out of nowhere. He has a long history of investing in the media business. But all of a sudden, it's like, oh, Buffett owns a bunch of Paramount. Now he owns 93 million shares of the company.And so we get into the conversation about the streaming wars. And I thought his comments on your eyeballs were quite hilarious.Lastly, Occidental Petroleum, of course, a lot of investors have been watching Warren Buffett build its position or his position in Occidental Petroleum under the potential, maybe he goes out and just buys the darn company. But Warren said, eh, eh, eh, unlikely to happen.But that's it for yours truly and Myles Udland. We're going to get back and get some air conditioning. It's a little warm here in Omaha, Nebraska.

""Berkshire’s portfolio includes the railroad and the energy business Garanimals, you name it, See's Candies — they're all businesses.""That has spawned from additional buying by Berkshire but also from growth in Apple’s services business and Apple’s commitment to stock buybacks.

AAPL,"Buffett's Berkshire posts $35.5 bln profit, buys back more stock","By Jonathan StempelOMAHA, Nebraska, May 6 (Reuters) - Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc posted a $35.5 billion first-quarter profit on Saturday, reflecting gains from stocks such as Apple Inc, while higher investment income and a rebound at car insurer Geico bolstered operating results.Berkshire also sped up repurchases of its own stock, buying back $4.4 billion, while paring its investments in other stocks such as Chevron Corp, which is still a major holding.Results were released ahead of Berkshire's annual shareholder meeting in Omaha, part of a weekend that draws tens of thousands of people to the city.Buffett, 92, has run Berkshire since 1965, transforming it from a struggling textile company into a conglomerate with dozens of businesses including Geico, the BNSF railroad, Berkshire Hathaway Energy, and manufacturing and retail units including See's Candies and Dairy Queen ice cream.The diversification has led many investors, not just Buffett fans, to view Berkshire as a stable long-term investment even amid recession fears and concerns about the banking industry.Net income equaled $24,377 per Class A share and rose from $5.58 billion, or $3,784 per share, a year earlier.That in part reflected a 27% jump in Apple's stock price, leaving Berkshire with a $151 billion stake in the iPhone maker.An accounting rule requires Berkshire to report unrealized gains and losses with net results, and Buffett urges investors to ignore the resulting volatility.Quarterly operating profit increased 13% to $8.07 billion, or about $5,561 per Class A share, from $7.16 billion.Those results benefited from Geico snapping a six-quarter string of underwriting losses, and a 68% increase in how much Berkshire's insurance units generate from investments.Geico's pretax underwriting gain was $703 million, benefiting from higher premiums, fewer crashes and a significant drop in ad spending, which may have led to fewer high-risk drivers seeking coverage.Berkshire's cash hoard grew $2 billion in the quarter to $130.6 billion, as the company sold $13.3 billion of stocks and bought just $2.9 billion.Chevron appears to have been among the sales, with Berkshire's stake falling 28% to $21.6 billion though the oil company's stock price dropped just 9%.Berkshire also owns a 23.6% stake in another oil company, Occidental Petroleum Corp.Its stock sales more than offset the $8.2 billion Berkshire spent to boost its stake in truck stop operator Pilot Travel Centers to 80% from 38.6%, leaving the founding Haslam family with 20%. The increase was expected.Profit at the BNSF railroad fell 9% to $1.25 billion, hurt by higher fuel costs and lower shipping volumes.Berkshire Hathaway Energy, normally a steady earnings generator, saw profit fall 46% as it set aside $359 million for legal and other costs from wildfires in Oregon and northern California, where it has multiple operations, in 2020.Operating results also reflected October's purchase of insurance holding company Alleghany Corp, while net results included a gain related to Pilot.Berkshire's Class A shares have risen 4.9% this year, trailing the Standard & Poor's 500's 7.7% gain. The index lagged Berkshire by 23.4 percentage points in 2022, excluding dividends.

Analysts upgraded a number of lenders they said were oversold.PacWest Bancorp rallied 81.7% and Western Alliance Bancorp jumped 49.2%, while the KBW regional bank index advanced 4.7%.Apple's quarterly results also cheered investors worried about a potential recession. The iPhone maker's shares hit their highest level in about nine months, and the stock ended up 4.7% in its biggest daily percentage gain since November.The stock was the biggest positive influence on all three major U.S. stock indexes.The U.S. Labor Department report showed job growth accelerated in April and wage gains increased solidly, suggesting the labor market has stayed strong despite recent interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve.With the jobs report, ""it's about the state of the U.S. economy, and what we saw today suggests it's in a better position than previously expected,"" said Kristina Hooper, chief global market Strategist at Invesco in New York.Investors have been worried that the rate hikes may eventually push the economy into recession.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 546.64 points, or 1.65%, to 33,674.38, the S&P 500 gained 75.03 points, or 1.85%, to 4,136.25 and the Nasdaq Composite added 269.02 points, or 2.25%, to 12,235.41.The Cboe Volatility index registered its biggest one-day decline since March 16.The Dow and S&P 500 still registered losses for the week, however, while the Nasdaq ended with a slight gain for the week.On Wednesday, the U.S. central bank raised rates by 25 basis points as expected, but Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted it was too early to say with certainty that the rate-hike cycle was over as inflation remains the chief concern.Apple drove gains in other tech shares, but all 11 major S&P sectors were higher on the day.The estimated decline in first-quarter S&P 500 earnings has been getting smaller since the start of the reporting season and is now at just 0.7% year-over-year, Refinitiv data showed on Friday.Volume on U.S. exchanges was 10.57 billion shares, compared with the 10.70 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 4.95-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.75-to-1 ratio favored advancers.The S&P 500 posted 13 new 52-week highs and 3 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 87 new highs and 104 new lows.(Additional reporting by Ankika Biswas and Sruthi Shankar in Bengaluru and Sinead Carew in New York; Editing by Subhranshu Sahu, Shounak Dasgupta and David Gregorio)","May 5, 2023 at 3:59 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-stocks-dow-best-day-205933900.html,Reuters,1.0,0.3,0.13051346801346805,0.4152146464646466

Apple CEO Tim Cook credited this win to emerging markets like India where the company sees plenty of opportunity for growth revenue, though still was down for yet another quarter. Seana, you could certainly look at the upside for Apple, IPhone sales still strong even in this environment. That's what a lot of investors like to look at as the big driver.There are still some concerns but not really necessarily limited to Apple when you think about something like laptop sales. Obviously, we have heard that over and over PC sales have been down in a big way, and obviously iPad sales there as well.IPhone sales in China was also better than expected in China. I'm bringing this up because it has been a weak spot for so many of Apple's competitors, so many of the tech giants out there have been talking about that the recovery in China is much slower than what they had initially anticipated in some of the China results coming in below expectations. But when it comes to Apple, their results they're coming in slightly higher than what the Street had been bracing for so the Street looking at that. As they were pretty pleased with that number.Services. We didn't talk that much about when it comes to this most recent earnings report, that came in just below what the Street was looking for, but it was a new record here for Apple.

It was a particular relief for investors after Qualcomm Inc., a key supplier, raised fresh concerns about phone demand earlier this week. Apple’s sales in China — a weak spot for other tech companies — also came in a bit better than feared.As expected, Apple announced plans for $90 billion in stock repurchases — the same as last year’s plan. The company also raised its quarterly dividend 4% to 24 cents a share.The shares jumped 4.7% to $173.57, the biggest single-day increase since Nov. 30. That added $107 billion to Apple’s market value and brings its year-to-date gain to 34%.Overall revenue amounted to $94.8 billion in the fiscal second quarter, exceeding the $92.6 billion analysts predicted. Though the sales fell 2.5% in the period, the company had warned investors to expect a drop of roughly twice that.Though the performance was better than expected, it marked two straight quarters of sales declines — a first for Apple since the pandemic began.

That compared with an average estimate of $1.43 a share.On a conference call with analysts, Apple said that revenue in the current period would drop by a similar amount as in the past quarter, which ended April 1. That suggests a dip of about 3%. The company also said it would continue to see a negative impact from foreign exchange rates.The prospect of Apple suffering a third consecutive sales drop raises questions about its growth prospects.“I think growth has to be on the mind of Apple investors today,” Scott Kessler, an analyst at Third Bridge, said in an interview on Bloomberg Television. “People have to wonder about whether or not this is a double-digit grower in revenues in the foreseeable future or at any point in the future.”Apple generated $51.3 billion in sales from the iPhone — its flagship product — in the second quarter, topping analyst predictions of $49 billion. That’s just a 1.5% rise from a year ago but marked a record performance for a March quarter, Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said. The increase came “despite the challenging macroeconomic environment,” he said in the statement.Like many tech CEOs delivering earnings reports, Cook also discussed artificial intelligence. He said it had enormous potential and that Apple would continue weaving it into products in a “very thoughtful” way.Read More: Apple’s Tim Cook Says AI Concerns Still Need to Be Sorted OutFrom a supply perspective, the second quarter was an opportunity for the iPhone 14 to rebound. The device had suffered from constraints during the previous period due to Covid policies in China.The iPad saw revenue fall 13% to $6.67 billion, roughly in line with estimates of $6.7 billion. New models, which included a revamped entry-level version and Pro models with M2 chips, didn’t do much to spur purchases in the quarter.Likewise, revenue in the Mac division dropped 31% to $7.17 billion. That trailed forecasts of $7.7 billion. Research firms already warned that it was a bleak quarter for the lineup, with IDC estimating that Mac shipments fell about 40% in the quarter. Apple had updated the MacBook Pro and Mac mini, adding faster processors, but they failed to reignite the unit’s sales.The home, wearables and accessories division, which includes AirPods, the Apple Watch and the TV set-top box — fell less than 1% to $8.76 billion. That beat estimates of $8.5 billion. The company added a faster processor to the Apple TV during the holiday quarter and updated its HomePod speaker during the March quarter.The services business, which includes iCloud, Apple Music, the App Store and the TV+ streaming service, brought in $20.91 billion, missing estimates of $21.1 billion. Still, it was a 5.5% gain from a year earlier. Last quarter, Apple promised that services revenue — alongside the iPhone — would accelerate.The company did particularly well in emerging markets, Cook said, pointing to record quarterly sales in Mexico, Indonesia, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates. He also called out growth in India, where Apple recently opened its first retail outlets.Read More: Apple CEO Sees India at Tipping Point as China Pivot QuickensThe company’s overall sales would have been up last quarter if you held currencies constant, Cook said. For Apple and other US companies with a global footprint, a strong dollar has decreased the value of revenue generated in other parts of the world.“Despite these challenges, we continue to manage for the long term,” Cook said.--With assistance from Ed Ludlow and Caroline Hyde.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekEven $500 Million a Year From Google Isn’t Enough to Save FirefoxWhy Launch Rockets When You Can Just Fling Them Into Space?Airbus Bets on a Stretched A220 Jet to Beat Boeing’s 737Data Science Is the Hot New Master’s at B-SchoolsHow a Dishwasher Engineer Challenged Elon Musk’s Grip on Commercial Space©2023 Bloomberg L.P.","May 5, 2023 at 3:06 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-iphone-bounces-back-helping-224910213.html,Bloomberg,0.0,0.125,0.020085360648740926,0.3763017498932991

The iPhone maker's shares were the biggest positive influence on all three major U.S. stock indexes.The U.S. Labor Department report showed job growth accelerated in April and wage gains increased solidly, suggesting the labor market has stayed strong despite recent interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve.With the jobs report, ""it's about the state of the U.S. economy, and what we saw today suggests it's in a better position than previously expected,"" said Kristina Hooper, chief global market Strategist at Invesco in New York.Investors have been worried that the rate hikes may eventually push the economy into recession.Regional bank shares also rebounded after recent weakness tied to the collapse of First Republic Bank. PacWest Bancorp rallied along with Western Alliance Bancorp.According to preliminary data, the S&P 500 gained 74.55 points, or 1.84%, to end at 4,135.77 points, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 264.67 points, or 2.21%, to 12,231.07.

AAPL,"Apple stock surges on earnings beat, strengthened iPhone sales","Yahoo Finance Live discusses a surge in shares of Apple after the company's latest earnings report came in above investor expectations, bolstered by strengthened iPhone sales.I listened to that earnings call, and CEO Tim Cook also talked a lot about emerging markets, particularly India, saying that it is an incredibly exciting market. And a lot of people, he commented, are entering the middle class there. And Cook said he hopes they can convince some of them to buy an iPhone. So the iPhone has returned as its crown jewel. As you know, the previous quarter, they hit a trouble spot in terms of a rare miss there.But Diane, like you said, iPhone sales, that was certainly the driver last quarter, with revenue gaining there, with a revenue of just over $50 billion. They obviously beat in terms of what the Street was expecting.And Akiko, the big debate going into this report was whether or not Apple was overvalued, whether or not the fundamentals really matched up with the rally that we have seen since the start of the year, with shares up just over 30%. And it seems like, at least from today's move, that the Street seems to be satisfied with these numbers.But I want to get back to that point that Diane made about India, because there's so much excitement around this market. We keep hearing that in light of the challenges they're seeing in China, India could be the next one. We've heard this before. And I know I keep saying there's a word of caution here, but when you think about where India has been, they've really struggled to build out their infrastructure. They have a very fragmented market. And at the end of the day, when you think about the price point for Apple and how they compete in the Indian market, it simply hasn't been right, in terms of where China has been versus where consumers are willing to shell out in India.So certainly a lot of promise there, and sure, Apple has to kind of look to India given the challenges they've seen in China, but it's going to be interesting to watch that play, or that storyline, because we've heard from many companies before, saying this is the next bet.","May 5, 2023 at 2:55 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/apple-stock-surges-earnings-beat-195551374.html,Yahoo Finance Video,0.0,0.0,0.17744030163385002,0.42391193036354335

AAPL,Apple isnt playing the AI hype game,"In fact, Cook didn’t mention the topic at all in his statement. The only time the CEO broached the topic was when he was prodded by Credit Suisse’s Shannon Cross, who asked for Cook’s thoughts on generative AI and where he sees it going. True to form, the CEO was light on specifics.Despite not mentioning the hottest buzzword since blockchain in his statement, shares of Cook’s Apple jumped more than 4% Friday. It’s not as though Apple doesn’t use AI either. Nearly every product Apple offers takes advantage of AI and machine learning.Cook specifically called out the company’s use of the technology to power the Apple Watch’s fall detection and ECG, as well as the crash detection capabilities in the watch and iPhone.“It's absolutely remarkable,” Cook said. “And so we view AI as huge and we'll continue weaving it in our products on a very thoughtful basis.”Apple is also set to hold its annual WWDC developer conference next month, during which it could make some kind of announcement regarding generative AI.But Apple’s ethos is to let technology largely fade into the background while boosting its products as a means to an end. In other words, if Apple does begin implementing some form of generative AI into its product portfolio, don’t expect the company to dwell on the fact that it’s doing so.If anything, you’ll hear about how the technology will power an updated version of Siri, or perhaps become a new assistant meant to help you better plan things like trips or your daily work schedule.However Apple decides to approach generative AI, bank on the company focusing more on how it helps its products, rather than the tech itself.For the latest earnings reports and analysis, earnings whispers and expectations, and company earnings news, click hereRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance","May 5, 2023 at 2:07 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-isnt-playing-the-ai-hype-game-190726240.html,Yahoo Finance,-0.4,0.4,0.28312615955473097,0.5003865182436611

So we think that's an interesting-- but WBD does have a big library. I think it's still in the turnaround phase. We expect WBD to look at Paramount as an acquisition.

AAPL,AI Is the Hot Topic on Earnings Calls This Quarter,"(Bloomberg) -- The mania for artificial intelligence is showing no sign of letting up in corporate America, with references to AI and related terms during calls with investors more than doubling from a year ago.Most Read from BloombergTexas Mass Shooting’s Bloody Images Add to Fervor in Gun DebatePowell’s Bet Against Recession Looks Good — Minus the Credit Crunch and a DC StandoffFootball Stadiums Belong in the SuburbsBiden Trails Trump as His Approval Rating Hits Low in ABC PollSingapore’s Soaring Rents Are Becoming a Political ProblemCompanies are scrambling to show they’re at the forefront of finding ways to use algorithms that can parse enormous quantities of information based on simple prompts or images. AI promises to change the way business gets done, from hiring (or firing) staff to calming angry customers in an online chat. Growing alarm from industry leaders and governments at the potential dangers of the new technology hasn’t deterred companies from voicing their commitment.The discussions build on the wave of interest following OpenAI’s launch of the ChatGPT chatbot in November, which drove a 77% pickup in mentions of AI in earnings calls in the fourth quarter. The pace only intensified in the first-quarter calls — there have been 1,072 mentions so far among companies in the S&P 500, from Meta Platforms Inc. to Alphabet Inc. and well beyond the tech industry.Online travel agency Expedia Group Inc., which reported a pickup in gross bookings in the first quarter, said its “performance was enhanced” by accelerating the use of AI and machine learning, including the integration of ChatGPT in its iOS app. Drugmaker Moderna Inc. said it’s opening a tech hub in Seattle that will help expand its AI capabilities, while food manufacturer Kraft Heinz Co. said the algorithms are helping it reduce waste.Apple Inc. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook expressed cautious optimism about the flood of new AI services, saying that while they have huge potential, there also are “a number of issues that need to be sorted.” On Thursday’s earnings call, Cook noted that Apple already uses AI across much of its lineup, including in features like fall detection on its smartwatch. The company will continue to add the technology to more of its products, he said, but on a “very thoughtful basis.”Companies outside the S&P 500 Index are also focused on the issue.Coinbase Global Inc. is taking a closer look at AI and how it could affect all parts of its business, according to Chief Financial Officer Alesia Haas. The biggest US cryptocurrency exchange is examining how it could improve the experiences of customers in a cost-efficient way.The comments come after industry experts and leaders have sounded the alarm about “out-of-control” development, with Elon Musk and others signing a petition to call for a pause in some activity. Tech industry leaders met Thursday with Vice President Kamala Harris to discuss oversight, and the White House has pledged to support new rules to mitigate harms from AI.--With assistance from Brad Skillman.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekWhy Launch Rockets When You Can Just Fling Them Into Space?Even $500 Million a Year From Google Isn’t Enough to Save FirefoxBiden Administration Tamps Down Talk of US-China DecouplingAirbus Bets on a Stretched A220 Jet to Beat Boeing’s 737Data Science Is the Hot New Master’s at B-Schools©2023 Bloomberg L.P.","May 5, 2023 at 11:38 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ai-hot-topic-earnings-calls-163818955.html,Bloomberg,0.25,0.8500000000000001,0.05972699972699973,0.46479856479856485
AAPL,Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) Q2 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today, along with the associated press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, which speak as of their respective dates. I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.And whether it's in the design lab in Cupertino, or in one of the brand new retail stores in India, I am constantly inspired by the way our people come together to make a real difference in the world. During the March quarter, we continued to face foreign exchange headwinds, which had an impact of more than 500 basis points, as well as ongoing challenges related to the macroeconomic environment. Revenue was down 3% year-over-year as a result, while on a constant currency basis, we grew in total and in the vast majority of the markets we tried. Despite these challenges, we continue to manage for the long term and to push the limits of what's possible, always on behalf of the customers who depend on our products whether it's students exploring new frontiers, developers dreaming up their next big idea, or artists taking their creativity to a whole new level.Let me share how these results showed up across our lineup of products and services. Let's start with iPhone, which set a new March quarter record with revenue of $51.3 billion. The iPhone 14 and 14 plus continue to delight users with their long lasting battery and advanced camera. And our pro users continue to rave about the most powerful camera system ever in an iPhone. This March, we were excited to expand emergency SOS via satellite to six new countries, bringing this important safety feature to even more users. We now offer this vital service in 12 countries, and I'm grateful for every note I've received from around the world about the life saving impact of our safety features. Now let's turn to Mac, which recorded $7.2 billion in revenue for the March quarter in line with our expectations.As we noted during our last call, Mac faced a very difficult compare because of the incredibly successful rollout of our M1 chip throughout the Mac lineup last year. And like our other product lines, Mac is facing some macroeconomic and foreign exchange headwinds as well. That said, the advancements we've made in power efficient performance continue to amaze our users. Our M2 Mac Mini customers are raving about the pro level powerhouse packed into an ultra-compact design, and users are marveling at the power and speed at the heart of every M2 powered MacBook Air and MacBook Pro, which allowed them to sustain even the most demanding workloads. iPad revenue was $6.7 billion, which was also in line with our expectations. Similar to Mac, iPad revenue performance was impacted by macroeconomic challenges, foreign exchange headwinds, and a difficult compare with last year when we launched the M1 powered iPad Air.iPad's versatility continues to be its greatest strength as we're helping students learn on the same family of devices artists use to create their next masterpiece. Across wearables, home and accessories, revenue was $8.8 billion. With its exceptional range of game changing health and safety features, Apple Watch becomes more and more indispensable every day. Apple Watch Ultra is attracting adventures, athletes and everyday users with its breakthrough features built for endurance and exploration. And with summer travel season soon heating up, there's no better companion in the air or on the road than AirPods, the best and most popular headphones in the world. Meanwhile, Services set an all-time record with $20.9 billion in revenue for the March quarter.We achieved all time revenue records across App Store, Apple Music, iCloud and payment services. And now, with more than 975 million paid subscriptions, we're reaching even more people with our lineup of services. Apple TV Plus continues to draw praise from customers and reviewers alike. During the past quarter, fans tuned in to incredible new series like Shrinking and The Big Door Prize and got to welcome Ted Lasso back into their homes for a third season. Movies like Tetris are captivating viewers with many more to come, including Martin Scorsese’s Killers of the Flower Moon later this year. Three years since its launch, Apple TV Plus programming has been celebrated across the globe, with over 1,450 nominations and more than 350 wins. Recently, we were thrilled to cheer on The Boy, the Mole, the Fox and the Horse, which won an Academy Award for best Animated Short Film.brandon-romanchuk-NOFyRmSQfUQ-unsplashThe first season of our historic tenure partnership with Major League Soccer is well underway with MLS season pass, we've created the ultimate destination for soccer fans, offering subscribers the ability to watch every match with no blackouts. And with baseball season in full swing, Apple TV Plus subscribers can watch their favorite teams with the return of Friday night baseball. This quarter, we launched Apple Music Classical, a standalone app that gives something special to classical music lovers. Apple Music Classical packs the largest library of classical music on Earth into a thoughtful and intuitive design that strikes all the right notes. Whether you're listening with AirPods or HomePod, the premium sound experience of Apple Music Classical will leave you with a feeling of being front row at the symphony just behind the conductor.In March, we also launched Apple Pay Later designed with users privacy and financial health in mind. Apple Pay Later allows users to split purchases into multiple payments with no interest or fees. And last month, we introduced Apple Card Savings Accounts to give users even more value out of their daily cash Apple Card Benefit. At Apple, our customers are at the center of everything we do. Nowhere is that more evident than retail, where our teams are dedicated to sharing the best of Apple with our customers. And we're constantly innovating to deliver exceptional experiences and meet our customers where they are. In the US, we launch Shop with a specialist over video, a new way for customers to learn about iPhone and find the one that's just right for them.And as I noted earlier, in a milestone for Apple, we just opened our first two Apple stores in India, in Mumbai and Delhi. I was there to see it for myself, and I couldn't have been more delighted by the excitement and enthusiasm of the customers, developers, creators and team members I got to spend time with. I've had the chance to connect with customers and teams all around the world in recent months, so many people shared with me that they were fans of Apple, not just because of the innovations we create, but because of the values that guide us, and that means a great deal to us. We're constantly striving to make a positive difference in people's lives and be a force for progress. We're investing in education to give students the skills they need to shape the future.We're helping to create pathways of opportunity for communities of color through our Racial Equity and justice initiative. And every day we're building an even more inclusive and diverse Apple rooted in our culture of belonging. To better understand how our work intersects with our values, look no further than what we're doing for the environment. We just celebrated Earth Day in April, and during that month, Apple announced that its global manufacturing partners now support over 13 gigawatts of renewable energy, a nearly 30% increase in just the last year. This translates to 17.4 million metric tons of avoided carbon emissions, the equivalent of removing nearly 3.8 million cars from the road. We're all investing up to an additional $200 million in our Restore Fund, which is designed to support innovative, scalable, nature based carbon removal projects, with the goal of removing 1 million metric tons of carbon every year.These are just the latest steps on our journey toward our 2030 goal to be carbon neutral across our supply chain and lifecycle of our devices. At the same time, we're advancing renewable energy across our supply chain, we're also sourcing more recycled materials in our products. Last month, we announced our plans to have all Apple design batteries include 100% certified recycled cobalt by 2025, and we remain committed to one day using only recycled and renewable materials in our products. We have a deep sense of mission here at Apple. We believe in the power of innovation to build a better world. We are determined to do our best work on behalf of our customers and to give them the tools that can enrich lives. So we will manage for the long term, just as we always have, with our eyes to the horizon, with limitless creativity, and with a deep belief that we can achieve anything we put our minds to.With that, I'll turn it over to Luca.During the quarter, our installed base of active devices continued to grow at a nice pace thanks to extremely high levels of customer satisfaction and loyalty, and reached an all-time high for all major product categories and geographic segments. Our Services set an all-time revenue record of $20.9 billion, up 5% year-over-year, on top of growing 17% in the March quarter a year ago. We reached an all-time services revenue record in Greater China and March quarter records in Americas, Europe and Rest of Asia Pacific. Company gross margin was 44.3%, up 130 basis points from last quarter, driven by cost savings and favorable mix shift towards services partially offset by leverage. Products gross margin was 36.7%, decreasing 30 basis points sequentially due to seasonal loss of leverage and mix, partially offset by favorable costs.Services gross margin was 71%, up 20 basis points sequentially. Operating expenses of $13.7 billion were at the low end of the guidance range we provided at the beginning of the quarter and continued to decelerate from the December quarter. We are closely managing our spend, but remain focused on long term growth with continued investment in innovation and product development. Net income was $24.2 billion. Diluted earnings per share were a $1.52, unchanged versus last year, and we generated very strong operating cash flow of $28.6 billion. Let me now provide more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue set a March quarter record of $51.3 billion, up 2% year-over-year despite significant foreign exchange headwinds and a challenging macroeconomic environment.We set March quarter records in several developed and emerging markets with India, Indonesia, Turkey and the UAE doubling on a year-over-year basis. Our active installed base of iPhone grew to a new all-time high and was up in all our geographic segments. We are very pleased by the results of the latest survey of US Consumers from 451 Research, which measured customer satisfaction at 99% for the iPhone 14 family. Mac revenue was $7.2 billion, down 31% year-over-year and in line with our expectations. These results were driven by the challenging macroeconomic environment coupled with a difficult compare against last year's launch of the completely reimagined M1 MacBook Pros. Despite this, the installed base of active Macs reached an all-time high across all geographic segments and we continue to see strong upgraded activity to Apple silicon.Also, the latest survey of US Consumers from 451 Research reported customer satisfaction at 96% for Mac. iPad generated $6.7 billion in revenue, down 13% year-over-year and in line with our expectations. This performance was due to two key factors, a tough compare against the launch of iPad Air powered by the M1 chip in the year ago quarter and headwinds from the macroeconomic environment. The iPad installed base reached a new all-time high in all geographic segments thanks to exceptional customer loyalty and a high number of new customers. In fact, over half of the customers who purchased iPads during the quarter were new to the product. Wearables, home and accessories revenue was $8.8 billion, down 1% year-over-year as the category experienced the impact from the macroeconomic environment.However, we did set March quarter records both in the US and in Greater China. We continue to see strength in our Watch installed base, which set a new all-time record, thanks to very high customer loyalty and new two rates, nearly two thirds of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter were new to the product. Moving to Services, we reached a new all-time revenue record of $20.9 billion. And in addition to the all-time records Tim mentioned earlier, we set March quarter records for advertising Apple Care and Video. Despite these records, as we saw in recent quarters, certain services offerings such as digital advertising and mobile gaming continue to be affected by the current macroeconomic environment. Stepping back, however, the continued growth in Services is the reflection of our ecosystem strength and the positive momentum we are seeing across several key metrics.First, our growing installed base of over 2 billion active devices represents a great foundation for future expansion of our ecosystem. We continue to grow across every major product category and geographic segment, thanks to very high levels of customer loyalty and satisfaction. Second, we saw increased customer engagement with our services during the quarter. Both our transacting accounts and paid accounts grew double digits year-over-year, each setting a new all-time record. Third, paid subscriptions showed strong growth. We now have more than $975 million paid subscriptions across the Services on our platform, up 150 million during the last 12 months and nearly double the number of paid subscriptions we had only three years ago. And finally, we continue to improve the breadth and the quality of our current services offerings from new content on Apple TV Plus to great new features available in Apple Pay and Apple Music, which we believe our customers will love.Turning to the enterprise market, we see business customers continuing to invest in the Apple platform to drive higher employee productivity and satisfaction. In Brazil, Boticario Group, the world's largest cosmetics franchiser, originally starting with iPhone, 12 employees manage operations across a network of retail stores, franchisees and resellers. As it continues to digitize its business, Boticario has chosen to move all software development in house and adopted Mac as the standard device for all of their developer teams across the world. In small business, we see an increasing number of customers relying on Apple hardware, software and services to power their businesses forward, from accepting payments on iPhone, to tracking inventory on Mac or iPad, to managing employee devices with Apple Business Essentials.As we celebrate National Small Business week here in the US, we are proud to continue supporting the small business community. Let me now turn to our cash position and capital return program. We ended the quarter with over $166 billion in cash and marketable securities. We repaid $2.3 billion in maturing debt and increased commercial paper by about $300 million, leaving us with total debt of $110 billion. As a result, net cash was $57 billion at the end of the quarter. During the March quarter, we returned over $23 billion to shareholders, including $3.7 billion in dividends and equivalents and $19.1 billion through open market repurchases of $129 million Apple shares. Given the continued confidence we have in our business now and into the future, today our Board has authorized an additional $90 billion for share repurchases as we maintain our goal of getting to net cash neutral over time.We're also raising our dividend by 4% to $0.24 a share, and we continue to plan for annual increases in the dividend going forward. As we move ahead into the June quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward looking information that Suhasini referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect our June quarter year-over-year revenue performance to be similar to the March quarter, assuming that the macroeconomic outlook does not worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter. Foreign exchange will continue to be a headwind and we expect a negative year-over-year impact of nearly four percentage points. For Services, we expect our June quarter year-over-year revenue growth to be similar to the March quarter, while continuing to face macroeconomic headwinds in areas such as digital advertising and mobile gaming.We expect gross margin to be between 44% and 44.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $13.6 billion and $13.8 billion. We expect OINE to be around negative $250 million excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments and our tax rate to be around 16%. Finally reflecting the dividend increase I mentioned earlier, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.24 per share of common stock payable on May 18, 2023, to shareholders of record as on May 15, 2023. With that, let's open the call to questions.","May 5, 2023 at 11:07 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-inc-nasdaq-aapl-q2-160746928.html,Insider Monkey,0.0,0.0,0.137061882351655,0.45056149700467907
AAPL,Apple Restores Its iPhone Superpower In Challenging Times,"During the quarter that ended on April 1st, Apple’s revenue slipped 3% from $97.28 billion in the prior quarter to $94.84 billion, topping Refinitiv’s consensus of $92.96 billion. As a result, Apple made a net income of $24.16 billion compared to $25.01 billion in the year-earlier period.  The resulting EPS was $1.52 per share, topping the expected $1.43.As CEO Tim Cook summed up, it was quite a good quarter from an iPhone point of view that generated $51.33 billion in revenue, especially when looked at market statistics as broader smartphone industry contracted nearly 15% during the period, according to an IDC estimate. StreetAccount consensus expected $48.84 billion. With iPhone revenue increasing 2% during the quarter, it is suggested that supply shortages and disruptions that have been plaguing the product for last few years have finally subsided.On the other hand, Mac and iPad didn’t score so well but Apple warned when it reported its previous quarter of this decline, they just fell more than expected. Mac generated $7.17 billion in revenue, below the expected$7.80 billion while iPad brought in $6.67 billion as revenue dropped almost 13% YoY, also below StreetAccount’s estimate of $6.69 billion. Although Mac sales dropped more than 31% YoY, it should be noted that this is a comparison to a period when Apple still benefited from the last days of the pandemic boom. Also, there’s the fact that Apple shifted to using its own chips that brought a longer laptop battery life. Other Products generated $8.76 billion in revenue, exceeding the expected $8.43 billion while services brought in $20.91 billion, below the expected$20.97 billion but marking an increase of 5.5% YoY which suggest that Apple’s focus to its highest-margin business is paying off.While sales contracted in most regions, Asia Pacific expanded to $8.11 billion.Cook announced that Apple is still resisting to layoffs which are the last resort. Meanwhile, Cook’s growth bet is on emerging markets such as India where Apple is luring away Android phone users. Apple recently open its first two stores in the country, in Mumbai and Delhi respectively.Apple managed to beat the odds and find new opportunities in a heavily hit market.Apple came out on top of the earnings week thanks to stronger than expected iPhone sales that make up more than half of its total revenue. It also achieved an all-time record in services with the March quarter record for iPhone in an extremely challenging macroeconomic environment.DISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

AAPL,Why Apple Stock Rallied Friday Morning,"Shares of Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) are ending the week on a high note, gaining as much as 5.1%. In its fiscal second quarter (ended April 1), Apple generated revenue of $94.8 billion, down 3% year over year, resulting in earnings per share (EPS) of $1.52, level with the year-ago period. Apple shareholders breathed a sigh of relief, having feared the combination of high inflation, rising interest rates, and continued economic uncertainty would have weighed more heavily on sales.","May 5, 2023 at 10:25 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/m/96444885-5f5f-33f0-b823-461fd3af9a51/why-apple-stock-rallied.html,Motley Fool,0.0,0.0,0.10805555555555554,0.34611111111111115
AAPL,Why Tim Cook believes India will be the next major growth opportunity for Apple,"Yahoo Finance’s Daniel Howley joins the live show to discuss second-quarter earnings for Apple.The issues that Apple have there, though, are many, mainly the fact that their devices are too expensive for most consumers in India at this point. Though Tim Cook did point out that there is a growing middle class there who will be able to afford their devices. And so that's where they see the next major growth opportunity for iPhone.Outside of that, let's just go over the numbers real quick. We had revenue of 94.8 billion versus expectations of 92.6 billion. That was a beat. They beat on adjusted EPS $1.52 versus $1.43. They beat on iPhone. They fell short on services, though, as well as Mac and iPad, though iPad just barely. And they beat on wearables.Now the Mac, iPad conversation, that really goes back to what we're seeing across all of tech where people aren't purchasing computers. They purchased them during the pandemic, they don't need them necessarily right now, and they're expensive items, and people may be questioning whether or not they need them.Smartphones are kind of a different story. People will buy them more regularly. They're also, now that the pandemic is largely passed, more essential to people's lives. There were a lot of people are going back to doing work on the go. So you're going to see iPhone perform better naturally than you would Mac.But I think one of the things that I just want to point out is throughout the big tech earnings season so far, the main word or I guess letters have been AI. And on the Apple call, Tim Cook didn't utter it once in his opening remarks. And the only reason he did was because an analyst asked about him, and it was only said four times.That's compared to the 30-some odd times have we heard Satya Nadella, Sundar Pichai, the 20-some odd times you hear Mark Zuckerberg say it in their own opening remarks. Tim Cook giving that a big fat goose egg.I think when it comes to the iPhone, though, I mean, you're going to get better sales overall just because there were some of those hold ups where people weren't able to get access to devices. People are going to continue to go out and buy them now. When you start looking at Q3, Q4, Q3 is where you get the seasonality really coming in because the next quarter or the end of Q3 beginning of Q4 is where you get the newer iPhones.So the September time frame really when they start coming out. So they're predicting similar growth to Q3 that they saw in Q2. What exactly that means, there was negative revenue growth, so there was a decline year-over-year. We'll see how that really works out.But I think it's just-- it speaks to Apple's ecosystem effect and its ability to keep people locked in. If you have an iPhone, you have an Apple Watch, you have AirPods, you're going to keep going back to your iPhone. You don't want to ditch it and then have to go to Android and figure something else out. So I think that's really a major part of the conversation.","May 5, 2023 at 10:19 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/why-tim-cook-believes-india-151952115.html,Yahoo Finance Video,0.03125,0.25,0.12548701298701298,0.4172525603648052

AAPL,"UPDATE 1-Apple stakes future growth on emerging markets, starting with India","(Adds share movement and market capitalization gains in paragraph 3)By Stephen NellisMay 5 (Reuters) - When Apple Inc surprised investors this week with a rise in iPhone sales despite a slump in the global smartphone market, Chief Executive Tim Cook credited emerging markets like India where the company is luring away Android phone users.Cook is betting that those markets will provide more opportunities for growth, with their youthful populations and relatively few iPhones.Shares of Apple rose more than 4% on Friday, putting the world's most valuable company on track for gains of around $120 billion in market capitalization.Apple said iPhone sales rose 1.5% to $51.3 billion for its fiscal second quarter even as global smartphone shipments fell 13% in January to March, according to research firm Canalys, whose data showed Apple gained market share from Android phones.Apple said it set sales records in several countries across South Asia, Latin America and the Middle East.""We're putting efforts in a number of these markets and really see, particularly given our low share and the dynamics of the demographics, a great opportunity for us in those markets,"" Cook told investors during a conference call.India is perhaps Apple's biggest focus. The company recently opened its first two retail stores there, in Mumbai and Delhi, and while Apple does not disclose revenue for the country, Cook told investors that it set a quarterly record and percentage growth was in very strong double digits year-over-year.""There are a lot of people coming into the middle class, and I really feel that India is at a tipping point, and it's great to be there,"" Cook said on the conference call.Apple was the second biggest revenue generating brand in India in 2022, second only to Samsung as it gained 18% of the total value of smartphone shipments, according to research firm Counterpoint.For Apple, selling an iPhone in an emerging market represents more than just the sale of one device - it represents the chance to get consumers hooked on Apple devices and services over time. Customers who start with an iPhone might later add an Apple Watch or AirPods or sign up for subscription services.Cook said he saw opportunities for Apple in India in services but said that average revenue per user - a metric known as ARPU in the subscription business - would take time to catch up to Apple's other markets.USED IPHONE BOOMPart of the reason that Apple has been able to gain market share in both emerging and developed markets is the emergence of a booming market for used iPhones.Sales of refurbished iPhones rose 16% in volume globally during 2022. India led the growth with a 19% jump, according to Counterpoint, with iPhones accounting for 11% of secondary smartphone sales in India.In an interview with Reuters on Thursday, Apple's Cook said little of Apple's direct iPhone revenue comes from refurbished devices. However he said the company has tried to bolster the used iPhone market by offering trade-in deals on its iPhones and building them sturdy enough to last several owners.""We encourage the market and it provides us an opportunity to hit some price points that we would not otherwise play in,"" Cook said in the interview.

It bails out the Fed for raising another quarter point,"" said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities.""It's been a tough week for the stock market, the regional banking problems have raised the fear factor, but Apple earnings came in strong. Stocks are coming up from near-term oversold condition.""Traders are betting the Fed will start easing the policy rate by September, according to CME Group's FedWatch Tool, compared with July before the release of the jobs data.The Fed raised its interest rate by 25 basis points as expected on Wednesday, but Chair Jerome Powell noted it was too early to say with certainty that the rate-hike cycle was over as inflation remains the chief concern.Wall Street fell on Thursday after PacWest Bancorp's move to explore strategic options deepened concerns about the health of regional banks, pulling down shares of peers and big banks such as JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo & Co.PacWest rebounded on Friday with a 48.3% gain, while Western Alliance Bancorp bounced back 32.0%. Western Alliance on Thursday denied a report that it was exploring a potential sale.At 9:48 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 459.05 points, or 1.39%, at 33,586.79, the S&P 500 was up 50.85 points, or 1.25%, at 4,112.07, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 141.80 points, or 1.19%, at 12,108.20.Following upbeat results from megacap companies, analysts expect profits for S&P 500 companies in the first quarter to decline 0.9% from a year earlier, according to Refinitiv data, compared with a 5.1% drop expected at the start of April.Used-car retailer Carvana Co jumped 30.8% as it expects to post a profit in the current quarter and plans to further bring down excess used-car inventory.Lyft Inc slumped 19% as the ride-hailing company's strategy to claw back market share from rival Uber Technologies Inc with lower fares stoked concerns about a hit to its profit margins.Advancing issues outnumbered decliners for a 6.06-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 3.47-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.The S&P index recorded four new 52-week highs and two new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 37 new highs and 43 new lows.

AAPL,There is no single home run product for Apple: TD Cowen Managing Director,"TD Cowen Managing Director Krish Sankar joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss second-quarter earnings for Apple, surprise growth in iPhone demand, CEO Tim Cook’s remarks on the pivot to India, and the outlook for the American multinational technology company.And then what you're seeing now is kind of like the natural evolution of that, which is going on from manufacturing to having a retail store out there because it is a big market. It's kind of like you could argue that, like China 10 years ago or whatever it might be. And that has huge potential.I would say that it does skew more towards the lower end of the phones today. But there's a potential that it could move more towards the premium models on the hardware side and eventually get more traction on the services also for Apple.And a lot of that was because the manufacturing was not happening in India. It is imported from Foxconn in China. And there was an excise duty added to it. I think it was somewhere in the range of 25% or something.So now you eliminate that excise duty because you're manufacturing domestically. So that automatically helps you keep the costs down. I think the bigger question of, will the market or the customer demand migrate from lower-end to premium models, I think it's a fair enough question.It does skew towards the lower end. But I think there's a potential, as Tim Cook explained, that as the middle class grows and gets bigger and larger, there's a potential that they will start gravitating more towards the higher end or the premium models like the iPhone Pro and the Pro Max.Now, keep in mind, some of the new product introduction, for example, AirPods, which came out a few years ago, quickly grew into a $15 billion revenue business. And I think where people tend to mistake it is the fact that there is no single home run kind of a product for Apple. But there are multiple different avenues which help the company continue to grow, whether you look at services--Services is actually a confluence of music, AppleCare, Apple Pay, you know, gaming downloads, Google advertising, et cetera. So there are multiple vectors there. And also on the hardware side, besides the iPhone, you do have the AirPods, the watch, the Mac, the iPads, et cetera.So I would say that, besides the iPhone there is no one single home run. But if you add all of the remaining together, you've seen the company grow from being a few hundred billion in revenue a few years ago to almost $400 billion in revenue today.So I think from that standpoint, I think Tim Cook's answer is probably, I would say, the right way of looking at it, which is they probably have a program. They probably are doing something. There's nothing to talk about it today.There's been rumors that they might start using some AI in their health care offering. So it's kind of like, I think they do have a lot of opportunities. But Apple has historically never spoken about new products and/or used a brand new technology unless they feel like it's not going to impact their bread and butter business.We really haven't seen that quite happen. I think where you're seeing the weakness in services has been more of the digital advertising side and some gaming. So that's kind of like more, I would say, not a consumer-related impact but more of a bigger picture impact.The second one is in terms of the iPad and the Mac slowdown. Keep in mind, they did have-- I think it's going against tough compares last year. They didn't have a brand new model. And then also in the Mac, they kind of came out with the in-house chips like the M3, M4, MX instead of using Intel chips anymore. So I think that kind of drove a huge surge last year. So you're kind of going against the compare today.But in general, I would say that the iPhone and the services have sounded to be much more resilient than people thought. In fact, part of the pushback I get from investors is the bear thesis which is, we head into the second half of this year. People do worry about iPhone numbers. And the reason is that, if you look at financial services and tech companies laying off a lot of employees, those are typically the iPhone purchasers.And people do worry that there's a risk of iPhone slowdown in the back half. We haven't seen any of that yet. Obviously, we do not have the visibility into back half yet. But at the same time, that's one big concern some investors have.","May 5, 2023 at 8:46 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/no-single-home-run-product-134624309.html,Yahoo Finance Video,0.03571428571428571,0.21428571428571427,0.15226530005941774,0.42445622188269233

The tech giant's overall revenue dropped 3%, marking a second quarter of declining sales, but a surprise growth in its iPhone business helped drive momentum along with its strong services unit. On the earnings call, Apple CEO Tim Cook spotlighted growth in India as the company continues to invest heavily in emerging markets and that one in particular.Third thing you need to know, Lyft beat on earnings in the first quarter, but its gloomy outlook overshadowed investor sentiment. The company's second-quarter revenue forecast came in well below what the Street was expecting, which sent the shares plunging, and they're still falling this morning. The stock's been on a downturn in the past year as the company looks to steal back market share from rival Uber, which continues to eat into Lyft's customer base.","May 5, 2023 at 8:38 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/april-jobs-report-apple-earnings-133815056.html,Yahoo Finance Video,0.5,1.0,-0.009307359307359311,0.4583333333333333

It bails out the Fed for raising another quarter point,"" said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities.""It's been a tough week for the stock market, the regional banking problems have raised the fear factor, but Apple earnings came in strong. Stocks are coming up from near-term oversold condition.""Traders are currently betting the Fed will start easing the policy rate by September, according to CME Group's FedWatch Tool, compared with July before the release of the data.The Fed raised its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points as expected on Wednesday, but Chair Jerome Powell noted it was too early to say with certainty that the rate-hike cycle was over as inflation remains the chief concern.Wall Street fell on Thursday after PacWest Bancorp's move to explore strategic options deepened concerns about the health of regional banks, pulling down shares of peers and big banks such as JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo & Co.PacWest rebounded on Friday with a 25.0% gain, while Western Alliance Bancorp bounced back 21.8%. Western Alliance on Thursday denied a report that it was exploring a potential sale.The S&P 500 has gained nearly 6% so far this year, while the S&P 500 Banks index and KBW Regional Banking index have lost 17% and 31%, respectively.Following upbeat results from megacap companies, analysts expect profits for S&P 500 companies in the first quarter to decline 0.9% from a year earlier, according to Refinitiv data, compared with a 5.1% drop expected at the start of April.At 8:50 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were up 222 points, or 0.67%, S&P 500 e-minis were up 33.5 points, or 0.82%, and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 87 points, or 0.67%.Used-car retailer Carvana Co jumped 47.1% as it expects to post a profit in the current quarter and plans to further bring down excess used-car inventory.Lyft Inc slumped 15.4% as the ride-hailing company's strategy to claw back market share from rival Uber Technologies Inc with lower fares stoked concerns about a hit to its profit margins.(Reporting by Ankika Biswas and Sruthi Shankar in Bengaluru; Additional reporting by Stephen Culp in New York; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta and Subhranshu Sahu)","May 5, 2023 at 8:15 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-stocks-wall-street-eyes-131504837.html,Reuters,0.125,0.5,0.0681129476584022,0.40426232017141117

This call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introduction, I would like to turn the call over to Suhasini Chandramouli, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.Suhasini ChandramouliTimothy D. CookLuca MaestriSuhasini ChandramouliThank you, Luca. (Operator Instructions) Operator, may we have the first question, please?OperatorCertainly. We will go ahead and take our first question from Erik Woodring of Morgan Stanley.Erik William Richard WoodringTim, maybe if we start with you. If we go back to the December quarter and the shutdowns -- the production shutdowns around the time, I think the question a lot of us were asking was, how should we think about the deferral of demand versus destruction of demand? March quarter was quite strong, 2% year-over-year iPhone growth. And so as we sit here in May, how have you seen customers that weren't able to purchase during the December quarter behave? Meaning, are you seeing that they deferred purchases to March and June? Could they be deferring purchases to later in hopes of buying a new iPhone? Just how should maybe we think about the cadence of that? And then I have a follow-up.Timothy D. CookErik, it's hard to quantify this, but we do believe we did recapture some amount of sales in the March quarter as we did see the iPhone performance accelerate relative to the December quarter. The production levels for the whole quarter were where we wanted them to be. So supply was not an issue during Q2.Erik William Richard WoodringOkay. Perfect. And Tim, maybe to follow up. It's been 3 or 4 quarters now that you've mentioned emerging markets like India and others, and I imagine having just opened 2 new stores in the country, it's clearly an important market for you. So maybe can you just talk about why you see India as such an important market? And others, how you think about monetization trends in the country? And specifically, what you have to do within the country to really ensure that India becomes maybe a more material mix of your business? And that's it for me.Timothy D. CookOperatorOur next question is from Mike Ng of Goldman Sachs.Michael NgIt's encouraging to hear about the record installed base across iPhone and across all devices. It's been, I think, double-digit growth over the last few years across the active devices. I was just wondering, is that a good way to think about the installed base growth going forward? And then for the iPhone installed base, specifically, I was just wondering if you could provide a little bit of texture around how you think about the growth there, whether regionally or by first smartphones versus switchers? And then I have a quick follow-up.Timothy D. CookYes. If you look at the installed base of active devices now, overall, it's more than 2 billion. As you know, we announced in January that we surpassed that. And this quarter, our Q2, rather, we set new records across each of the geographic segments in each of the major product categories. And that's despite declines in current quarter sales, in particular, in Mac and iPad. This is a huge asset for us, and it's a testament to the overall customer satisfaction and engagement and loyalty of our customers. And so we view this as a major asset for us. The iPhone base is well over 1 billion active devices. We see this as upgrade rates and these sorts of things may change quarter-to-quarter depending upon macroeconomic. But if you back up and look at the installed base, we feel great about the size of it and the rate that it's growing.Michael NgGreat. Excellent. And then it was also encouraging to see the number of devices per iPhone user continue to grow. I was just wondering if you could talk about the opportunity to continue to increase that number of Apple devices per iPhone user? And if you have any color around how the monetization per user may differ from those, for lack of a better words, super users versus those that may not be as deep into the ecosystem?Timothy D. CookWe try really hard to design our products in such a way that they work seamlessly together. And so whether that's the Watch or the Mac and so that you can start working on one device and finish it on the other. And so there are a good deal of people out there that have multiple Apple devices. And I think this is a testament to the customer satisfaction and loyalty that we've been able to get from the incredible design that our engineering teams do on our products.OperatorOur next question is from Shannon Cross of Credit Suisse.Shannon Siemsen CrossTim, can you talk a bit about AI? Obviously, more than the topic of the day, it seems like the topic of the year. Just how do you think about it through your products and services? I know you use it in different ways. But also, if you can just give us any thoughts you have on generative AI, and I don't know where you see it going? Not sure what you want to say on it, but I'm really curious as to your take.Timothy D. CookYes. Thanks for the question, Shannon. As you know, we don't comment on product road maps. I do think it's very important to be deliberate and thoughtful in how you approach these things. And there's a number of issues that need to be sorted as is being talked about in a number of different places, but the potential is certainly very interesting. And we've obviously made enormous progress integrating AI and machine learning throughout our ecosystem, and we weaved it into products and features for many years, as you probably know. You can see that in things like fall detection and crash detection and ECG. These things are not only great features. They're saving people's lives out there. And so it's absolutely remarkable. And so we are -- we view AI as huge. And we'll continue weaving it in our products on a very thoughtful basis.Shannon Siemsen CrossOkay. And then can you talk a bit about your shift in manufacturing and diversification of manufacturing footprint? I'm curious, obviously, you have a very tight network in China. So how is it going to move to some of these other regions? Are you seeing any impact from a margin perspective? Or just any thoughts you have on what you've seen as you started to shift more and more outside of China, whether it's growth or it's actual production?Timothy D. CookOur supply chain is truly global, and we're investing all over the world. We're investing in the U.S. We're investing in a number of other countries as well. And so we make products everywhere. We'll continue to invest everywhere. And we'll continue to look for ways to optimize the supply chain based on what we learn each and every day and week and so forth to ensure that we can deliver the best products and services for our customers. If you sort of step back and look at how we performed over the last 3 years on the supply chain, despite this parade of horribles if you will, between the pandemic and the chip shortages and macroeconomic kind of factors, the supply chain has been incredibly resilient, and we feel good about what we are and what our plans are.OperatorOur next question is from Wamsi Mohan of Bank of America.Wamsi MohanTim, you had called out on December quarter earnings that Pro models were significantly constrained. Do you see a catch-up on the Pro models specifically in the March quarter? And was the mix better than typical? And do you see that mix renormalizing here in the June quarter? And maybe you can comment on the channel inventory levels as well for iPhones? And I have a follow-up.Timothy D. CookSure. It's hard to quantify, Wamsi, but we do believe we did recapture some amount of sales in the March quarter. And obviously, we had to set the channel at the right levels, and we're very comfortable with the channel inventory that we have on a forward basis. So we do think there were some, but it's difficult to quantify it.Wamsi MohanOkay. And Tim, as a follow-up, you launched so many services around Apple Pay. Most recently, you mentioned buy now, pay later, high-yield savings account. Where do you see the expansion in the payments ecosystem over time? And do you look at the payments ecosystem as a standalone revenue opportunity? Or is it more about making the devices even more inseparable from us?Timothy D. CookOperatorOur next question is from David Vogt of UBS.David VogtTim, I just wanted to go back maybe kind of dig into the restocking of inventory in the channel versus what we're hearing from a demand perspective, that appears to be a little bit softer in the March quarter from some of your larger carriers that exhibited relatively weak upgrade rates. So I just wanted to kind of get a sense for where you're seeing demand signals today vis-a-vis how you were thinking about it maybe a month ago or even 3 months ago. And is there sort of an acceleration in demand or any sort of signals that you might want to share with us at this point? And then I have a follow-up.Timothy D. CookI don't want to go into what we're seeing in Q3 other than the guidance that Luca has given. But for Q2, I think you're probably referencing primarily U.S. carriers. And if you look at our geographic distribution of our performance, it was lower in the Americas, which is primarily predominantly the United States. And a part of that is, I believe, is macroeconomic, a part is that there were more promotional activity in the year ago quarter. And so I think that's what you're seeing there. The -- where our results were really stellar during this quarter was really in the emerging markets. And we're -- we couldn't be prouder of the results that we had there.David VogtGreat. That's helpful. And then just quickly on services, are you seeing anything in terms of consumers' behavior other than sort of the macro that you mentioned and tough comps on digital advertising and mobile gaming? Are you seeing users of all the disparate services change and what they're using, how they're using it and time spent with an Apple service now that we're technically, hopefully, fully past COVID with China almost fully reopened. I'm just trying to get a sense for how user or consumer behavior has changed over the last 3 to 6 months?Luca MaestriOperatorOur next question is from Samik Chatterjee of JPMorgan.Samik ChatterjeeI guess maybe I can follow up on David's question here on services. And in the past, prepandemic, the growth rate there was more about sort of mid-teens. The growth rates today, where you stand, even if I back out FX impact, is more about low double digits. So one of the questions that we get often from investors and I want to get your thoughts on is even as the installed base growth seems to have accelerated, are these more cyclical drivers that are depressing growth at this point from returning to that level? Or do you see more of a rollout on the monetization that you have need to do to get back to those growth levels? And I have a follow-up, please.Luca MaestriSamik, the areas where we are seeing the impact of the macro environment, as I mentioned, is digital advertising. As you know, obviously, the macro environment is not helping on that front, and mobile gaming, where we've seen a bit of a slowdown, partly due to the macro environment, partly due to the fact that we had very elevated usage during the COVID years. But outside of those areas, we continue to see very healthy growth rates.Samik ChatterjeeOkay. And maybe if I can just follow up, and this is more of a macro question. I don't know if, Luca, you, or Tim, want to take this. But obviously, the macro is not sort of helpful at this point, but what you're sort of implying in terms of your guide is momentum for your products remains pretty stable. You're actually guiding to a modest uptake, ex FX, for the overall business. I mean, what are you seeing in terms of customer sort of spending trends? And overall, does the consumer sort of continue to deteriorate in terms of spending patterns? And is your sort of momentum here just a function of share gains? How should we think about sort of where the consumer is versus what your products are doing independent of that?Luca MaestriPart of it, Samik, is what Tim was talking about. We're having great momentum in emerging markets, and those are markets where our share is low, gives us a great opportunity to grow over time. It also helps us with the growth of the installed base because you can imagine any places where our market share is low, we tend to add a lot of switchers, people that are new to the Apple ecosystem. That increases the installed base. And over the longer term, it obviously improves our ability to monetize on services as well.OperatorOur next question is from Amit Daryanani of Evercore.Amit Jawaharlaz DaryananiI have 2 as well. I guess, first up on gross margins for the June quarter, they seem to be holding up fairly well, especially given the fact that sales are going down on a sequential basis. So Luca, I wonder if you can just touch on what's driving the strength in gross margin sequentially? It's offsetting the lack of leverage, if you may. And then I also noticed that the range of your gross margin guide is 50 basis points. It's typically 100. What does that entail? What does that mean?Luca MaestriAmit Jawaharlaz DaryananiGot it. That's helpful. And then I guess, Tim, if I just go back to the India discussion a bit. Perhaps you could just contrast what you're seeing in India today versus what you saw in China maybe a decade or so ago. Is that a reasonable ramp to think India would have? Or could it be different from the lessons you've seen in China?Timothy D. CookI think each country is different and has their own journey, and so I hesitate to compare too much. But what I do see in India is a lot of people entering the middle class, and I'm hopeful that we can convince some number of them to buy an iPhone. And we'll see how that works out. But right now, it's working out well.OperatorOur next question is from Krish Sankar of TD Cowen.Krish SankarThe first question I had is for Tim. Tim, you have primarily been a consumer-centric company, but it seems like the line is blurring with the iPhone, iPad hardware products being used for corporate applications. So is there a way to segment how much of your revenues today are coming from enterprise and consumer? And does the slower corporate IT spend impact your outlook for iPhone, iPad, Mac, et cetera? And then I had a follow-up.Timothy D. CookInternally, we have our estimates for how much is enterprise versus consumer. And the enterprise business is growing. We have been focusing a lot on BYOD programs, and there's more and more companies that are leaning into those and giving employees the ability to select which is -- plays to our benefit, I believe, because I think a lot of people want to use a Mac at work or an iPad at work. And so -- but we're certainly primarily a consumer company in terms of our revenues, obviously.Krish SankarGot it, Tim. And then just as a follow-up, obviously, a lot of questions on the India retail opening. I'm just kind of curious, you also mentioned that you hope to convert a lot of folks into iPhone there. Where do you think the biggest opportunity is? Is it like primarily a hardware business like the iPhone, iPad, Wearables, et cetera? Or do you think there is a service opportunity in India longer term, too?Timothy D. CookI think there's an opportunity across the board, including in services. Obviously, the ARPUs are lower in India for whether you're talking about TV and movie streaming or music. The ARPUs are much lower than other regions. But if you look at it over a long arc of time, I think there's a good opportunity across the board.OperatorOur next question is from Aaron Rakers of Wells Fargo.Aaron Christopher RakersI guess my first question is that I want to go back to kind of the geographical dynamics. I'm curious, as we all think about the reopening attributes of China, just how you would characterize the shaping of demand you saw through the course of this last quarter and kind of how you're thinking about the impact of that reopening playing out over the next couple of quarters?Timothy D. CookAaron Christopher RakersYes. Very helpful, Tim. As a quick follow-up, I want to go back to Amit's question on gross margin. You talked about FX, the lessening impact there. I'm just curious if when you look at your gross margin, obviously, you got mix attributes kind of potentially continuing to drive that higher. But I'm curious on the current environment, how you would characterize the component pricing dynamics and what you're thinking about in this current quarter's guidance?Luca MaestriYes. The environment on the component side is favorable. We've seen component prices decline during the March quarter, and we expect the same during the June quarter.OperatorOur next question is from Sidney Ho of Deutsche Bank.Shek Ming HoI was hoping you can talk about the linearity of the March quarter and perhaps the first 4.5 weeks of the current quarter. It looks like things are slowing down quite a bit elsewhere. But if my math is right, your fiscal third quarter guidance implied product revenue will be a little bit lower than seasonal average on a sequential basis. Any color would be helpful.Luca MaestriWe said that we expect our performance during the June quarter at the revenue level to be similar to the one that we've just reported for the March quarter. Keep in mind that we always have differences in the launch timing across our products. And also that especially over the last few years, we've seen a certain amount of supply disruptions. Sometimes it was COVID related, sometimes it was related to specific component shortages. Just to remind you, in the June quarter a year ago, we had the full quarter impact of the launch for both of the iPhone SE and the iPad Air, which leads to a more difficult compare. So I think it's important to keep those things in mind.Shek Ming HoOkay. That's helpful. Maybe as a quick follow-up. You talked about Apple Pay Later. How has the feedback been so far? And how do you expect the adoption of that service over the next 2 quarters?Timothy D. CookThe feedback for both Apple Pay Later and the Savings product have both been really good. And we think both of them help customers live a better -- or a healthier financial life. And so we are very excited about the first days of both of them.OperatorOur next question is from Harsh Kumar of Piper Sandler.Harsh V. KumarTim, you're one of the largest chip companies. You're not a component maker, you actually use your own products. But we almost never hear in any context of you guys being a beneficiary, Apple being a beneficiary for either the CHIPS Act money or the R&D tax credit that's being proposed. I was just curious if you are eligible for any of those? And then I've got a follow-up.Timothy D. CookI don't see Apple participating in the CHIPS Act directly, but we would be a beneficiary indirectly because some of our partners would hopefully be recipients of it, and therefore, put in additional capacity. And so on that sort of indirect basis, we would have a benefit.Harsh V. KumarUnderstood. Look, I wanted to clarify your comments about June. When you're saying June performance will be similar to March, I assume on a year-on-year basis, which would be June, should be down about 2-something -odd percent. Is that a fair way? And then my question that I wanted to ask, maybe another one for Tim was, what do you think is the largest opportunity in your services offering? I mean you're doing a great job. You just set a record. But surely, there must be areas where you think you can do better?Luca MaestriYes. So to the -- to your question around the June performance, yes, on a year-over-year basis, so comparable to the March quarter on a year-over-year basis.Timothy D. CookHarsh, I think we can do better on everything. And so I wouldn't just point to one of them. If you look at the number of active devices and the growth of active devices, I think, our services are underpenetrated in a number of different ways. And so I -- the way that I look at it is there's opportunity in many of them.Suhasini ChandramouliAll right. Thank you, Harsh.

Hager; CEO & Director; Jamf Holding Corp.Ian Goodkind; CFO & CAO; Jamf Holding Corp.Jennifer Gaumond; IR Officer; Jamf Holding Corp.John Strosahl; COO & President; Jamf Holding Corp.Joshua Christopher Reilly; Senior Analyst; Needham & Company, LLC, Research DivisionKoji Ikeda; VP & Research Analyst; BofA Securities, Research DivisionMatthew George Hedberg; Analyst; RBC Capital Markets, Research DivisionNicholas Paul Mattiacci; Associate Analyst; Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research DivisionRaimo Lenschow; MD & Analyst; Barclays Bank PLC, Research DivisionUnidentified AnalystOperatorJennifer GaumondDean J. HagerJohn StrosahlIan GoodkindOperatorMatthew George HedbergGreat. And first of all, congrats, Dean, first on your retirement. That is exciting news for you. And John, obviously, on your promotion, it certainly seems like the company is in really good hands here on a go-forward basis. So congrats to both of you. John, maybe for you, and I'll keep it to one question for the sake of time. What continues to resonate with us and when we talk to channel partners is the success you're having on the security side. And you spent a lot of time in your script, and obviously, you talked about Okta as well. I'm curious, as device adds are under pressure, how much of a -- like that initial land is like both device management and security. Because I have to imagine that's become increasingly -- in focus today on some of those initial lands versus just a straight upsell.John StrosahlYes. Matt, thanks for the question. And you're absolutely right. It's the security adding of the security products has given us many more vectors into a customer (inaudible) customer may have one device management per device, they can certainly have 5 different security products. And so we've had (inaudible) large deals actually this last quarter were security (inaudible) and we've expanded from there. So we really -- we're bullish on that. We've had great success in our business plan, especially in the SMB area, which includes, of course, our security products as well. And we will continue to invest accordingly.OperatorAnd our next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow from Barclays.Raimo LenschowCongrats from me as well, Dean, although if you retire, I feel really old because I don't think you're that old (inaudible). Quick question. If you think as a seat-based model, obviously, with the economy suffering, you kind of suffered a little bit. But like where are we do you think on the journey in terms of normalization in terms of customers kind of thinking about their deployment, their deployment size, et cetera. It's obviously a journey like -- how do you feel about your customer conversations where we are on that journey? And then I have one follow-up.Dean J. HagerThanks, Raimo, for the question. And just for clarity, are you speaking like in terms of our penetration within the devices for our customers? Are you thinking more on where we're at from a market perspective on device shipments?Raimo LenschowMore on the latter, actually, like device shipments and how that's kind of playing out?Dean J. HagerRaimo LenschowYes. Okay. Perfect. And then on the follow-up, like you had a few price increases for Pro and other product lines at the beginning of the year. Has that impact -- like what's the impact here on ARR? Is that like meaningful? Is that coming through all in one? Or how should we think about that?Ian GoodkindYes. I can jump in here, Dean, yes. Thanks for the question. Yes, the impact on ARR is just pennies. I mean we just announced it, customers are just getting into it. We have a ton of customers that will come in, in the latter half, that will impact. But right now, that's a de minimis impact. What's really driving that, again, is our security posture. And John talked about it earlier, where we're starting to get really savvy and we're starting to see really good business plan sales, and that's helping drive it.Dean J. HagerThe good news is that the receptivity from our customers on the price increase has been positive that there is significant more value that's delivered, and seems to be being received well.OperatorAnd our next question comes from the line of (inaudible) from William Blair.Unidentified AnalystThis is (inaudible). Also echoing the congratulations, Dean and John, excited to work with you more in the future. So just one for me on the macroeconomic environment. Do you -- are there any further updates you have to share from any observations in the first quarter and into April and early May? Any particular areas of strength or weakness you could call out?Dean J. HagerUnidentified AnalystGot it. Perfect. And then just one quick other follow-up for me. You touched on it a little bit in your prepared remarks, but is there anything else that you have to -- you could comment on with customer buying behavior in this environment? Have you seen customers reduce any deployments? Or are they just a little slower to expand?John StrosahlYes. Alex, I'll take that. This is John. Thanks for the question. We have. We have. It's similar across the industry. Companies are taking a little longer to discern whether or not they're going to spend. They're waiting a bit to see the line of sight. We've been able to offset that in many cases by having a broader variety of products to sell into them. But we are seeing some more judicious approach from our customers just like we're taking ourselves internally.OperatorOne moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Joshua Reilly from Needham & Company.Joshua Christopher ReillyI'll put out my congrats as well to both Dean and John there. If you look at the M2 cycle for Apple here versus the M1 launch, our work indicates that the material change in power consumption price and security with M1, and the M2 kind of still offers a similar value proposition so that wave of initial upgrade with M1 isn't as strong with M2. Can you just comment, is that what you're seeing as well? And does that create a tough comp for you this year in addition to the macro challenges that we're seeing in the market?Dean J. HagerThanks for the question, Josh. But I don't know that I'd be an expert on that in terms of the uptake on the M2 versus M1. We haven't really seen dialogue within our customers of that, that would either (inaudible) deployment. More so from our perspective, it really comes down to what is the price (inaudible) efficiency versus an alternative non-Mac computer and then, of course (inaudible). And as you well know, back in the day, they used to have to battle against user preference versus the (inaudible). But today's price performance, the Mac is not a more expensive machine. As a matter of fact, I have (inaudible) provide very strong cases. As a matter of fact, I was (inaudible) last week, talking about the cost advantages of buying specifically the MacBook Air. So if you look over the last year, I mentioned in my commentary, for the last 4 quarters, not one quarter but 4 quarters, the Mac decline year-over-year is 6% versus 23% for non-Mac computers. So that's really what our focus is.Joshua Christopher ReillyGot it. That's helpful. And then if you look at the year-over-year device growth of 13%, that's actually pretty strong off a tough comp in the current macro, I think. And while the ARR (inaudible) device growth did slow a bit sequentially. What are you seeing in terms of cross-sell trends and the mix of devices that were actually sold in the quarter? And was there some more education devices sold in this quarter ahead of the buying season that might have impacted that?Dean J. HagerYes. So not necessarily on the education side. But it's -- (inaudible) to recognize the fact that we grew devices in this atmosphere by 13% over the year. To be perfectly honest, when we look at our year-over-year expansion of Mac devices specifically in commercial markets, in some ways, it's kind of surprising given the overall shipment numbers of Mac in the last year. And what that tells us is Jamf is just winning a larger share. So therefore, (inaudible) there's just a lot of under-managed and under-secured Mac out there still. So even though the Mac did grow in shipments over the last year, we still did. That bodes pretty well for when we believe the device shipments will normalize and come back.OperatorOne moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Koji Ikeda from Bank of America.Koji IkedaI echo everyone's sentiment here. Congrats, Dean on the retirement. Congrats, John. Just a couple of questions for me. Dean, just starting off with you, I guess, kind of going back to the why now, and I want to frame this question a little bit differently. I totally get it on the personal front. The announcement of John makes a whole lot of sense, I totally get it. But what did you see from the business side that made you kind of made that, help ease your decision for the why now?Dean J. HagerJohn, the fact that John is here. I mean he and I have been partnered in this for the last 8 years now. And for anybody watching closely, I mean, let's face it, John was Chief Revenue Officer when I (inaudible) to join us. And then about 2.5 years ago to Chief Operating Officer. And then 1.5 years ago to President, and most of the company has been reporting up to him. So frankly, as we looked at the organization and John has really been running things, it just made that decision all the easier. As I mentioned, this has really been a part of a long-term plan for -- with myself and my wife, Jenny. And so just knowing that the company is in such good hands, made it an easy decision.Koji IkedaGot it. Got it. That's helpful. And I guess since the spotlight is on John, question directed to you. Just kind of thinking about -- in the past, maybe, in the easier times or the better times of 2020 and 2021, when companies were buying units in anticipation of hiring. How do we think about the effects of that more just-in-time mentality as we think about 2023 and 2024? And really, the question here is when do you think we could start maybe (inaudible) or the comps get easier from this change in buying patterns?John StrosahlYes. Thanks, Koji. We've talked a lot about the macroeconomics. You've heard a lot on other earnings calls. And as we see the headwinds for device shipments (inaudible) we've taken an opportunity during that time to really learn how to better sell security and get that muscle memory going. And so the reports we're looking at can suggest that -- and we plan this way that we'll look for headwinds to the end of the year. As device shipments come back and device expansion comes back, we anticipate early next year, we've got a great tailwind of not having just a device on that device expansion -- device management, but then also security on top of that. And so that's really what we are planning around.OperatorNicholas Paul MattiacciThis is Nick on for Chad Bennett. Just one for me. If you could talk about how your partner channel has been performing and if there are any geographies, verticals or other segments where channel partners are becoming more impactful? And then on Apple specifically, if anything has changed in regard to your go-to-market relationship?Dean J. HagerYou want to grab that, John?John StrosahlYes, I'll take that. So if I understand the question, Nick, is how are we working with our channel and how is that advancing. Obviously, the channel partners that we work with now also work with Apple. And Apple is in fact, a channel (inaudible) on the education side. We've put a concerted effort into building our channel organization with the vast majority of our sales coming internationally through the channel and increasingly the amount coming in the U.S. through our channel partners as well. So we're going to continue that because we believe there's great efficiencies there. We've seen, and as I mentioned, great traction outside the United States, and we're learning a lot from that and bringing that into the U.S. as well to gain more efficiencies in our go-to-market through the channel.Dean J. HagerThe one other thing I'll just add on top of that is -- and John commented on it that we continue to expand our go-to-market relationships like we did with -- entering (inaudible) program with Microsoft, which is a good -- while not a co-selling relationship (inaudible) co-marketing relationship, but the AWS relationship is a co-selling relationship. It was really our very first quarter after launching us as part of the AWS Marketplace, and we couldn't have been happier with the traction that we saw that in Q1, and we think that's going to build over time.OperatorThis does conclude the question-and-answer session as well as today's program.

AAPL,"Futures climb on Apple earnings cheer, jobs report on tap","By Caroline ValetkevitchNEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rallied on Friday, with the Dow posting its biggest one-day percentage gain since Jan. 6, as shares of Apple surged more than 4% after upbeat results and U.S. jobs data pointed to a resilient labor market.Adding to the bullish momentum, regional bank shares rebounded from declines tied to the collapse of First Republic Bank. Analysts upgraded a number of lenders they said were oversold.PacWest Bancorp rallied 81.7% and Western Alliance Bancorp jumped 49.2%, while the KBW regional bank index advanced 4.7%.Apple's quarterly results also cheered investors worried about a potential recession. The iPhone maker's shares hit their highest level in about nine months, and the stock ended up 4.7% in its biggest daily percentage gain since November.The stock was the biggest positive influence on all three major U.S. stock indexes.The U.S. Labor Department report showed job growth accelerated in April and wage gains increased solidly, suggesting the labor market has stayed strong despite recent interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve.With the jobs report, ""it's about the state of the U.S. economy, and what we saw today suggests it's in a better position than previously expected,"" said Kristina Hooper, chief global market Strategist at Invesco in New York.Investors have been worried that the rate hikes may eventually push the economy into recession.The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 546.64 points, or 1.65%, to 33,674.38, the S&P 500 gained 75.03 points, or 1.85%, to 4,136.25 and the Nasdaq Composite added 269.02 points, or 2.25%, to 12,235.41.The Cboe Volatility index registered its biggest one-day decline since March 16.The Dow and S&P 500 still registered losses for the week, however, while the Nasdaq ended with a slight gain for the week.On Wednesday, the U.S. central bank raised rates by 25 basis points as expected, but Fed Chair Jerome Powell noted it was too early to say with certainty that the rate-hike cycle was over as inflation remains the chief concern.Apple drove gains in other tech shares, but all 11 major S&P sectors were higher on the day.The estimated decline in first-quarter S&P 500 earnings has been getting smaller since the start of the reporting season and is now at just 0.7% year-over-year, Refinitiv data showed on Friday.(Graphic: U.S. earnings recession - https://www.reuters.com/graphics/GLOBAL-MARKETS/myvmoxajbvr/chart.png)Volume on U.S. exchanges was 10.57 billion shares, compared with the 10.70 billion average for the full session over the last 20 trading days.Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 4.95-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.75-to-1 ratio favored advancers.The S&P 500 posted 13 new 52-week highs and 3 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 87 new highs and 104 new lows.(Additional reporting by Ankika Biswas and Sruthi Shankar in Bengaluru and Sinead Carew in New York; Editing by Subhranshu Sahu, Shounak Dasgupta and David Gregorio)","May 5, 2023 at 5:46 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/futures-climb-apple-earnings-cheer-104620162.html,Reuters,0.0,0.0,0.13418003565062395,0.42493315508021406

AAPL,GLOBAL MARKETS-Shares waver as rate pause bets and Apple earnings clash with U.S. bank rout,"*US futures rise as markets eye Fed summer rate cuts, Apple earnings*Dollar set for seventh weekly decline of last eight weeks*US jobs growth expected to have slowed last month(Updates comment on U.S banks and economy)By Naomi RovnickLONDON, May 5 (Reuters) - Global stocks hovered in a tight range on Friday, still on course for a weekly loss, as investors balanced bets of central banks pausing rate increases with the latest rout in shares of U.S. regional lenders.MSCI's broad index of global equities edged 0.1% higher following a four-day losing streak, while Europe's Stoxx 600 share index rose 0.2%.The mood on Wall Street appeared rosier, with futures contracts on the benchmark S&P 500 share index adding 0.5% following better than expected earnings from Apple Inc .Contracts on the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 gained 0.6%, although analysts warned all this could change if U.S. jobs data were stronger than expected, complicating the Federal Reserve's job of soothing banking sector worries while battling still-high inflation.On Thursday, Los Angeles-based PacWest Bancorp's said it was exploring a sale, deepening falls for U.S. regional banking stocks.Shares in this troubled sector have dropped 11.5% this week, following the collapse of First Republic Bank over the weekend that renewed fears of a financial sector crisis.Markets are pricing for the Fed, which raised its main funds rate by 25 basis points (bps) to a range of 5%-5.25% on Wednesday, to pause at its next meeting in June and begin rate cuts from July.""There will be concerns about credit quality and how that ripples through the banking system,"" said Gerry Fowler, head of European equity strategy at UBS.The Fed's recent hiking cycle, started early last year, has been its most aggressive since the 1980. Bets of a pause have risen since the collapse of Californian lender Silicon Valley Bank in March.""The time-frame for monetary policy (tightening) to impact the economy is around 16 months,"" Fowler said. ""We're only just entering the phase where monetary policy is having its maximum impact.""Later on Friday, the U.S. non-farm payrolls report for April is expected to show the slowest jobs growth in almost 2-1/2 years. Economists polled by Reuters expect to see that U.S. employers added 180,000 new workers, in the smallest gain since December 2020, with the unemployment rate edging up to a still historically low 3.6%.""We think further (rate) hikes are off the table,"" said Emmanuel Cau, head of European equity strategy at Barclays. But he cautioned that only a ""quick drop in inflation"" or a ""sharp weakening"" of economic growth would lead the Fed to start cutting borrowing costs.In government debt markets, U.S. Treasuries pared back some price gains after a strong performance all week.

AAPL,"Apple stakes future growth on emerging markets, starting with India","By Stephen Nellis(Reuters) -When Apple Inc surprised investors this week with a rise in iPhone sales despite a slump in the global smartphone market, Chief Executive Tim Cook credited emerging markets like India where the company is luring away Android phone users.Cook is betting that those markets will provide more opportunities for growth, with their youthful populations and relatively few iPhones.Shares of Apple rose more than 4% on Friday, putting the world's most valuable company on track for gains of around $120 billion in market capitalization.Apple said iPhone sales rose 1.5% to $51.3 billion for its fiscal second quarter even as global smartphone shipments fell 13% in January to March, according to research firm Canalys, whose data showed Apple gained market share from Android phones.Apple said it set sales records in several countries across South Asia, Latin America and the Middle East.""We're putting efforts in a number of these markets and really see, particularly given our low share and the dynamics of the demographics, a great opportunity for us in those markets,"" Cook told investors during a conference call.India is perhaps Apple's biggest focus. The company recently opened its first two retail stores there, in Mumbai and Delhi, and while Apple does not disclose revenue for the country, Cook told investors that it set a quarterly record and percentage growth was in very strong double digits year-over-year.""There are a lot of people coming into the middle class, and I really feel that India is at a tipping point, and it's great to be there,"" Cook said on the conference call.Apple was the second biggest revenue generating brand in India in 2022, second only to Samsung as it gained 18% of the total value of smartphone shipments, according to research firm Counterpoint.For Apple, selling an iPhone in an emerging market represents more than just the sale of one device - it represents the chance to get consumers hooked on Apple devices and services over time. Customers who start with an iPhone might later add an Apple Watch or AirPods or sign up for subscription services.Cook said he saw opportunities for Apple in India in services but said that average revenue per user - a metric known as ARPU in the subscription business - would take time to catch up to Apple's other markets.USED IPHONE BOOMPart of the reason that Apple has been able to gain market share in both emerging and developed markets is the emergence of a booming market for used iPhones.Sales of refurbished iPhones rose 16% in volume globally during 2022. India led the growth with a 19% jump, according to Counterpoint, with iPhones accounting for 11% of secondary smartphone sales in India.In an interview with Reuters on Thursday, Apple's Cook said little of Apple's direct iPhone revenue comes from refurbished devices. However he said the company has tried to bolster the used iPhone market by offering trade-in deals on its iPhones and building them sturdy enough to last several owners.""We encourage the market and it provides us an opportunity to hit some price points that we would not otherwise play in,"" Cook said in the interview.(Reporting by Stephen Nellis in San Francisco; Additional reporting by Munsif Vengattil in New Delhi and Akash Sriram in Bengaluru; Editing by Sonali Paul)","May 5, 2023 at 12:53 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-stakes-future-growth-emerging-055317855.html,Reuters,0.0,0.1125,0.14440599173553717,0.3725275482093664

MSFT,"The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights Alphabet, Microsoft, Meta Platforms and Shopify","Chicago, IL – May 8, 2023 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, Microsoft Corp. MSFT, Meta Platforms, Inc. META and Shopify Inc. SHOP.Here are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:The tech sector is up more than 18% this year, more than double the S&P 500's roughly 7%.But this is a huge sector, with many different kinds of companies offering very different kinds of products and services to often different markets. Therefore, it's difficult to come up with common factors that drive the sector.Until you look at the market capitalization of some of these companies. Alphabet, for instance, with its market cap of over $1.3 trillion, has a much greater impact on the sector's performance when it rises around 19% year to date than, say, BigBear.ai Holdings, although this stock has soared 285%+. The same can be said of Microsoft, with its market cap of over $2.2 trillion (up nearly 27% year to date), or of Meta Platforms with its $614 billion market cap (up 94%) or Shopify with its $59 billion (up 65%).The point is that this is a sector with some very large cap stocks that skew the average whenever they make big moves. Since they have been making big moves this year, it makes sense to see why.The biggest reason perhaps is the stabilization in the interest rate. As inflation rates continue to moderate, the markets have been expecting the Fed to stop raising rates. After the latest hike, the Fed has indicated that there may not be further hikes this year. Rate hikes are a problem for most growth stocks because these are the riskiest assets. Investors put their money into these stocks in the hopes that they'll get outsized returns at some future date.Technology companies may be younger or mature, but by their very nature, they invest huge capital in futuristic innovations that may or may not generate the anticipated returns. Therefore, when higher rates make less risky assets more attractive, some investors switch to those. Additionally, tech companies may also take a certain amount of debt to fund their R&D. Stabilization in the interest rate therefore makes these stocks more attractive.Another reason for the big moves is the effect of the pandemic. In the initial phase of the pandemic, the rapid digitization generated huge business for some of these players. This pulled in five years of demand (by some estimates). As a result, demand dropped drastically in the following period, a situation that persists today, in some segments. Given the disappointing outlook, tech stocks plunged last year, making them more attractive from a valuation perspective.The third reason, and this is specific to the larger cap tech stocks, is that although they invest humongous amounts of cash in their future innovations, they also have certain existing products that are pretty much like cash cows, generating year upon year of solid revenue and cash flows, as in the case of any good quality mature company.Unlike mature players in certain other sectors, these stocks don't pay dividends. Or, just a handful of them – like Apple – do. They tend to pour the whole thing back into the business and maintain large cash balances for financial flexibility. This makes them attractive in times of uncertain demand, especially the mild recession/soft landing that most analysts are anticipating. So, let's take a closer look at some of these big tech stocks:Alphabet Inc.Search giant Alphabet posted strong numbers last quarter, exceeding revenue estimates by 1.5% and earnings estimates by 10.4%. In the past month, the company's 2023 earnings estimate increased 3.9% while the 2024 estimate increased 2.0%. Revenue and earnings are expected to increase an estimated 6.1% and 18.2% this year and 10.6% and 16.1%, respectively in the next.Microsoft Corp.A provider of computer software, productivity solutions, search, cloud infrastructure services and more, Microsoft is easily one of the most attractive players right now. In the last quarter, Microsoft's earnings surprise of 10.4% came on top of a revenue surprise of 3.8%. Analyst estimates for the years ending June 2023 and 2024 have increased 2.9% and 2.4%, respectively. Its revenue is expected to increase 6.3% this year and 10.3% in the next. Earnings are expected to increase 4.3% and 12.1%, respectively.Meta Platforms, Inc. Social media provider Meta posted a sales surprise of 4.2% in the last quarter, which resulted in an earnings surprise of 34.7%. In the last 30 days, its 2023 earnings estimate has increased 12.6% and 2024 estimate 13.2%. Analysts currently expect revenue growth of 8.6% this year and 10.8% in 2024. Earnings are expected to grow 19.6% and 24.3%, respectively.Shopify Inc. Shopify provides an online commerce platform for small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs). The company's March quarter earnings surprise of 50% came on top of revenues that surprised by 4.9%. Analysts have merely fine-tuned their estimates on this company's revenue and earnings, which are expected to grow 18.1% and 25%, respectively in 2023 and 21.6% and 395.8%, respectively the following year.Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) rating on Meta shares and a #2 (Buy) rating on the others.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

MSFT,Inside Microsofts bid to win Silicon Valleys cut-throat AI race,"Artificial intelligence’s big bang moment is here – and it will bring a lot of money to those who get it right.ChatGPT offers Microsoft a chance to leapfrog Google in search, but the technology offers far more than just that. Chief executive Satya Nadella has said AI will shape everything the company does in future.During an unexpectedly sunny visit to Microsoft’s usually rain soaked campus in Redmond, Washington, executives demonstrate ways in which they hope AI will boost its business.One example: the technology has been plugged into its Powerpoint software to help office workers complete hours of work on presentations in minutes.A series of bullet points fed to Copilot — Microsoft’s name for its AI chatbot integrations — result in the creation of an entire slide deck, complete with stock images, corporate branding and even the right colour scheme. Full sentences extrapolated from the terse bullet points garnish each slide.Walter Sun, the company’s vice president of AI for business applications, believes Copilot could even become an “autopilot” by 2028. Rather than tasking a human to oversee the creation of a slide deck with the help of AI, an executive could simply ask software directly to do all the legwork.“We start by shipping features where there's a human in the loop to make sure everything works,” says Sun. “Maybe in five years, these things will become more self-service. I think it’s possible”.Copilot was first trialled commercially on GitHub, a Microsoft-owned collaboration website for software developers. Instead of humans writing code and then posting it to GitHub for others to critique (and borrow from), Microsoft used the GPT programme to create a virtual assistant capable of writing software code all by itself in response to user prompts.AI assistants within Microsoft’s products will become ubiquitous, writing code, emails and Powerpoint presentations for people why they deal with less automatable tasks such as meetings and presentations.However, limiting the role of humans in day-to-day business raises knotty questions.“The question is, are we designing PowerPoint in a way that takes away my agency, my humanity?” asks Frank Shaw, the company’s marketing chief. “Or are we empowering them to spend more time on the parts that matter?”It is also an ominous portent for white collar workers. Just as advances in machinery have left scores of blue collar workers on the sidelines over the past century, AI could make many office jobs of today redundant.Connor Axiotes, a researcher at think tank the Adam Smith Institute, believes mass adoption of AI will lead to higher levels of unemployment in a way that no other past technologies have.“Future AI systems will have superhuman labour abilities, be smarter than humans, and encroach on a domain that no transformative technology ever has – cognitive labour,” he says.“That part of working ability which has been humanity's comparative advantage will no longer be so. This is why I think, more than ever, we are likely to see these stickier kinds of unemployment.”Jon Friedman, Microsoft’s corporate vice president of design and research, is sanguine.“In every age in the history of technology, the thing that we thought was going to replace human jobs created more human jobs,” he says.Microsoft’s representatives are keen to stress that the company wants to “augment” what people can do with AI instead of replacing them outright. Yet it is difficult to ignore the potential for AI to destroy jobs, even in its current state.Even as tech companies plough ahead, there’s the question of whether AI is good enough to do the job in the first place.During the Copilot trial on GitHub, one software developer complained that the AI sometimes “suggests things that are just wrong”. Another said using the product was akin to “having to deal with a trainee programmer who knows how to search on Google” — not a glowing endorsement.ChatGPT has a well documented tendency to “hallucinate”: produce convincing-sounding answers to questions that are in fact wrong. Plagiarism is also an issue when it comes to creating new material such as code or Powerpoint presentations.Rashik Parmar, chief executive of the British Computer Society, says that AI programmes such as ChatGPT are “only as good as the source of data” used to train them.He warns: “If somebody intentionally starts to poison some of the data sources, without you knowing about it, then that can create all kinds of ramifications, right?“We're all super excited about what can be done without really thinking through the potential risks.”Ciaran Martin, the former head of the National Cyber Security Centre, has warned the technology “risks undermining the fabric of our society” by making the spread of convincing fake news so easy.At Microsoft, writing PowerPoint presentations appears a long way off the downfall of humanity.The company is keen to press ahead with its advantage in AI, hoping to gain a crucial edge over rivals including Google and Amazon. If it does not, it risks falling behind.Professor Mike Wooldridge of the Alan Turing Institute says: “What we're seeing is a massive pivot in Big Tech towards this technology, because this finally delivered a mass market product for AI.“They're all broadly in the same sort of ballpark... But OpenAI and Microsoft have basically got a year's head start.”OpenAI ultimately aims to create “artificial general intelligence” (AGI), regarded by most researchers as the field’s Holy Grail: the creation of true machine consciousness. AGI would allow machines to essentially think for themselves and this breakthrough moment could be reached within years, some in the field believe.It is AGI that pessimists are most worried about. Once machines can be set off to complete tasks with relative autonomy, how can we control what they do? Thought experiments abound about how relatively simple commands could lead to the end of humanity.Would Microsoft adopt AGI if OpenAI creates it?“Honestly, I don’t know,” Eric Boyd, the company’s corporate vice president of AI platform technology, says in Redmond. It is difficult to speculate “on this thing that doesn’t exist”, he says.However, Boyd adds: “I can’t imagine we wouldn’t take advantage of some really advanced technology.”Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

MSFT,MakeMyTrip Adds AI Voice Chat to Lure More India Travelers,"(Bloomberg) -- India’s largest online travel-booking service is rolling out a voice chat service powered by artificial intelligence, becoming the country’s first major company to harness recent advances in generative AI.Most Read from BloombergTexas Mass Shooting’s Bloody Images Add to Fervor in Gun DebatePowell’s Bet Against Recession Looks Good — Minus the Credit Crunch and a DC StandoffFootball Stadiums Belong in the SuburbsBiden Trails Trump as His Approval Rating Hits Low in ABC PollSingapore’s Soaring Rents Are Becoming a Political ProblemMakeMyTrip Ltd. will use Microsoft Corp.’s Azure Open AI technology for the chat, initially available in English and Hindi, the Indian company said in a statement Monday. The voice assistant will appear on the company’s app and the front page of its travel site and is designed to help users book flights and holidays.Nasdaq-traded MakeMyTrip is trying to expand beyond India’s 75 million high-frequency e-commerce users, targeting hundreds of millions of new potential customers. The country’s expanding middle class includes consumers who aren’t conversant in English or comfortable with technology.“The next phase of MakeMyTrip’s growth will come from India’s 100 million e-commerce users who prefer to engage in their own language and via voice,” Rajesh Magow, the company’s co-founder and chief executive officer, said in a video interview. “We have to bridge the gap.”The company, which plans to add further Indian languages to the service, showcased an AI voice trial chat in the Bhojpuri language native to parts of northern India. The AI agent offered airline information, flight dates, timings and pricing. After choosing a trip, users received a QR code to help them complete a payment.The services uses a combination of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 systems developed by Microsoft-backed OpenAI, MakeMyTrip said.The world’s most populous country has 800 million internet and 600 million smartphone users, but only about 150 million of those make purchases online and high-frequency transactors are just half that, Magow estimates. India has 22 official languages and most of the 1.4 billion population isn’t comfortable with typing or using English language apps or websites, he said.“We want to use the voice bot to reach a new set of users from India’s smallest cities and towns,” Magow said. “But adoption will take time.”Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekWhy Launch Rockets When You Can Just Fling Them Into Space?Even $500 Million a Year From Google Isn’t Enough to Save FirefoxBiden Administration Tamps Down Talk of US-China DecouplingAirbus Bets on a Stretched A220 Jet to Beat Boeing’s 737Data Science Is the Hot New Master’s at B-Schools©2023 Bloomberg L.P.","May 8, 2023 at 2:50 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/makemytrip-adds-ai-voice-chat-075041428.html,Bloomberg,0.5,0.5,0.11349645099645103,0.4635817635817636

Microsoft will provide financial support to bolster AMD’s efforts, as it works with the chipmaker on a homegrown Microsoft processor for AI workloads.AMD shares were ultimately off about 1% for the week.Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) shares slid after the company forecasted far lower-than-anticipated results for is fiscal third quarter: The company expects 3Q23 EPS in the range of $1.70-$1.90, compared with the consensus of $2.20, and revenue in the range of $8.1-8.9B, compared to the consensus of $9.25B.Q2 earnings of $2.15 per share were in line with expectations.The company said demand for smartphones had deteriorated as China remains weak, calling the macroeconomic environment ""challenging.""Deutsche called the guidance ""disappointing by any measure"" but also believes the company ""should be an attractive beneficiary of the eventual cyclical rebound once one actually occurs (not a matter of if, but rather when).""Shares sank more than 7% for the week.Block (NYSE:SQ) shares initially bumped higher after the fintech name reported better-than-expected Q1 results: earnings per share of $0.40 vs. Wall Street's estimate of $0.35, and above-par revenue of $4.99 billion.For the full year, the company raised its full-year adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) forecast to $1.36 billion, up from the prior $1.3B.Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan were both positive on the stock after earnings. JPMorgan sees more room for further upside, calling its operating leverage potential ""underappreciated by the market."" It added, ""SQ remains one of our favorite ideas.""For the week, though, shares slipped 2.5%.Coinbase's Q1 results were better than feared, driven by cost cuts and a jump in subscription revenue: The company lost just $0.34 per share, far better than expectations for $1.39 in the red.After its Thursday report, shares were trading about 9% higher.Looking ahead, the company said it expected subscription and services revenue to fall in the second quarter. For the full year it continues to seek to improve full-year 2023 adjusted EBITDA in absolute dollar terms versus full-year 2022.BofA said the results were solid but that big fundamental questions remain unanswered about the company, and maintained its Underperform rating on Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN): ""We continue to think retail crypto volumes will remain weak and the regulatory overhang will linger for some time,"" the analyst said in a note.Barclays lowered the price target to $61 from $74 per share.

MSFT,15 Countries That Have The Highest Taxes On High Incomes,"Taxation is a fundamental pillar of modern societies, enabling governments to generate revenue and fund essential public services. Among the various forms of taxes, high-income taxes play a pivotal role in addressing income inequality and ensuring a fair distribution of wealth. These taxes, levied on individuals with significant earnings, serve as a means for governments to secure funds for social welfare programs, infrastructure development, and other public expenditures.In contrast, the bottom quintile, comprising individuals earning less than $25,000 annually, paid significantly less, totalling $142 billion in taxes. This disparity in tax payments highlights the progressive nature of the U.S. tax system, where higher-income individuals contribute a significant portion of the nation's tax revenue.The TCJA also weakened the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) and doubled the tax-free exemption for wealth transfer from $11 million to $25.8 million. These changes heavily favoured the wealthiest Americans, with the top 0.1% receiving an average tax cut of $193,380, while middle-income households saw an average reduction of $930.While the TCJA is set to expire in 2025, discussions regarding its extension are ongoing. This highlights the importance of implementing a fairer progressive taxation system to ensure a more equitable distribution of tax burdens. President Joe Biden has proposed tax reforms to address these disparities and promote a more just tax code.Digital ReportingIn 2023, the trend of implementing digital reporting requirements will continue to strengthen, impacting businesses globally. The expansion will focus on three main systems:Countries like Portugal, Romania, and Italy are mandating these digital reporting measures, while others like France, Spain, and Germany are also moving towards implementation. This ongoing shift highlights the increasing significance of digitalization and its implications for businesses and tax professionals worldwide.Frequent VAT changes Overall, this demonstrates a dynamic landscape where governments are actively recalibrating VAT systems to optimize revenue and address economic challenges like inflation with efforts to align with international standards.Governments worldwide increasingly adopt digital transformation in tax administrations to enhance tax compliance, collect revenue, and simplify tax filing processes. The global volume of data from digital sources is projected to nearly triple from 2020 to 2024, driven by the rise of big data., emphasizing the need to ensure taxpayers are not subjected to additional levies and that Amount A accurately allocates residual profits.We ranked the 15 countries that have the highest taxes on high incomes based on the top tax rate of the highest income brackets observed in 2023. The information has been gathered from reputable sources of PWC Tax Summaries for each individual country. All the countries listed observe progressive taxation structures. They are presented in ascending order, starting with the countries with the lowest tax rates, and progressing to the ones with the highest tax rates.Top income tax rate: 42%Top income tax rate: 45%For households, income up to $12,082 is not subject to any tax, resulting in a 0% tax rate. In the next bracket, from $12,082 to $30,804, a tax rate of 11% is applied. As income increases, individuals and households earning above $189,455 face the highest tax rate of 45%.Top income tax rate: 45%The income tax system is structured on different levels based on taxable income amounts subject to cumulative withholding. The first level applies to incomes up to $5,210 and is subject to a withholding rate of 3%. For incomes ranging from $5,210 to $20,800, the second level comes into effect with a higher withholding rate of 10%.Top income tax rate: 45%An individual resident of Australia must pay income tax on their earnings from both Australian and foreign sources, with certain exceptions for temporary residents and specific types of foreign income and gains.However, non-resident individuals are only liable for Australian income tax on income sourced within Australia, excluding interest, royalties, and dividends, which are generally subject to withholding tax. There are no additional surtaxes, alternative taxes, or other income taxes on personal income in Australia.Top income tax rate: 46.25%Hence, any income exceeding $65,857 falls into the highest income tax bracket. In this bracket, the income tax rate is 31.85%. The municipal tax rate of 14.67% continues to apply, resulting in a total tax rate of 46.25%.Top income tax rate: 47%Furthermore, taxpayers earning salaries below $16,800 (previously $15,680) will no longer be required to file a tax return, and effective tax rates will be reduced for salaries below $22,071.75.Top income tax rate: 48%For tax purposes, Portugal residents are subject to progressive income tax rates ranging from 14.5% to 48% in 2023. This applies to their worldwide income.Top income tax rate: 49.5%Top income tax rate: 50%Top income tax rate: 50%Belgium imposes income tax on its residents, regardless of their nationality, based on their worldwide income. Non-residents, on the other hand, are only taxed on income derived from sources within Belgium.The calculation of personal income tax (PIT) involves determining the taxable income and applying progressive tax rates to different portions of that income. For the income year 2023, the federal tax rates in Belgium range from 0% to 50%.23 countries Without Income Taxes15 States with the Lowest Business Taxes15 States with the Highest Tax Revenue per Capita","May 6, 2023 at 3:58 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-countries-highest-taxes-high-205812317.html,Insider Monkey,0.16,0.5399999999999999,0.07221187025534849,0.34992408557625954

MSFT,3 Tech Titans Battling for AI Dominance,"As everybody knows by now, artificial intelligence (AI) has been Wall Street’s shiny new toy in 2023, with companies speaking on the technology in a snowballing fashion.And so far, many big-tech names have been in the spotlight regarding the technology, including Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL, and NVIDIA NVDA.And as we can see in the chart below, all three stocks have provided market-beating returns in 2023, outperforming the S&P 500 handily.But how does each company stack up currently? Let’s take a closer look.NVIDIAA big focus point of NVDA’s latest release was its Data Center results, which include its AI operations; Data Center revenue totaled $3.6 billion, growing 11% from the year-ago quarter.

MSFT,Charlie Munger on AI: 'I think old-fashioned intelligence works pretty well',"Legendary investors Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger aren’t fully sold on artificial intelligence.Microsoft has risen as a leader in the space, investing $10 billion in OpenAI. And the company's founder, Bill Gates, recently presented some of the company’s AI technology to Buffett.""It did these remarkable things but it couldn’t tell jokes,"" Buffett said. ""Bill told me that ahead of time and prepared me. But it just isn’t there.""Buffett likened the disruptive nature of AI to the atomic bomb, which the United States used to ultimately bring an end to World War II. Buffett described the war tactic as necessary but questioned: ""Is it good for the next 200 years of the world?""“When something can do all kinds of things I get a little bit worried because now we won’t be able to un-invent it,"" Buffett said.""With AI, it can change everything in the world, except how men think and behave,"" Buffet said.

MSFT,Apple isnt playing the AI hype game,"In fact, Cook didn’t mention the topic at all in his statement. The only time the CEO broached the topic was when he was prodded by Credit Suisse’s Shannon Cross, who asked for Cook’s thoughts on generative AI and where he sees it going. True to form, the CEO was light on specifics.Despite not mentioning the hottest buzzword since blockchain in his statement, shares of Cook’s Apple jumped more than 4% Friday. It’s not as though Apple doesn’t use AI either. Nearly every product Apple offers takes advantage of AI and machine learning.Cook specifically called out the company’s use of the technology to power the Apple Watch’s fall detection and ECG, as well as the crash detection capabilities in the watch and iPhone.“It's absolutely remarkable,” Cook said. “And so we view AI as huge and we'll continue weaving it in our products on a very thoughtful basis.”Apple is also set to hold its annual WWDC developer conference next month, during which it could make some kind of announcement regarding generative AI.But Apple’s ethos is to let technology largely fade into the background while boosting its products as a means to an end. In other words, if Apple does begin implementing some form of generative AI into its product portfolio, don’t expect the company to dwell on the fact that it’s doing so.If anything, you’ll hear about how the technology will power an updated version of Siri, or perhaps become a new assistant meant to help you better plan things like trips or your daily work schedule.However Apple decides to approach generative AI, bank on the company focusing more on how it helps its products, rather than the tech itself.For the latest earnings reports and analysis, earnings whispers and expectations, and company earnings news, click hereRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance","May 5, 2023 at 2:07 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-isnt-playing-the-ai-hype-game-190726240.html,Yahoo Finance,-0.4,0.4,0.28312615955473097,0.5003865182436611

MSFT,Microsoft exec admits the console wars are over: We lost the worst generation to lose,"A chastened and downbeat Phil Spencer issued what appeared to be a brutally honest 40-minute mea culpa in which he even implied his job was on the line after a series of self-inflicted blunders.“It’s just not true that if we go off and build great games, all of a sudden you’re going to see console share shift in some dramatic way. We lost the worst generation to lose in the Xbox One,” the Microsoft exec said.“I know that will upset a ton of people,” he said, “but it’s just the truth of the matter when you’re third place in the console marketplace and the top two players are as strong as they are.”Spencer is now pushing Microsoft to focus not on hardware but on software: for example, its monthly subscription service Game Pass. He's also bullish on new features that allow consumers to buy one game and play it seamlessly across a variety of devices from Xbox to PC to new handheld devices like the Steam Deck and the Asus ROG Ally—outside the Sony ecosystem. Nevertheless, he refuted repeated speculation that Microsoft might ditch its commitment to console gaming in favor of a sole focus on streaming.While there are consumers who prefer casual games on their smartphone and those who are into hard-core ones best played on a PC, the usual entry ticket for these immersive fantasies is the purchase of either a PlayStation, an Xbox, or a Nintendo Switch.“They’ve defined a market of cloud gaming that in my mind doesn’t really exist yet today,” said Spencer, reaffirming he would appeal the CMA decision. “But they have a point of view that maybe we have a lead in a market that is just forming.”“There is nothing that is more difficult for me than disappointing the Xbox community,” Spencer said. “Just to kind of watch the community lose confidence, be disappointed—I’m disappointed, I’m upset with myself.”","May 5, 2023 at 12:49 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-exec-admits-console-war-174951394.html,Fortune,-1.0,1.0,-9.46969696969761e-05,0.5482954545454545

MSFT,Microsoft hires Brussels-beating lawyer to take on Britains competition watchdog,"Microsoft has hired a lawyer who has repeatedly defeated the EU as it seeks to overturn a decision by Britain’s competition regulator to block its £55bn gaming takeover.The US tech giant has enlisted Daniel Beard KC as it prepares to lodge an appeal at the Competition Appeal Tribunal in the coming days.Mr Beard of Monckton Chambers is seen as a leading competition barrister and has overturned multi-billion dollar penalties levied on Apple and Intel by the EU in recent years.Last year, Mr Beard overturned a €1.1bn fine handed to Intel more than a decade ago after the European Commission had claimed the company had abused its dominance of the microchip market. The case was seen as a landmark blow for Brussels’ attempts to rein in Big Tech.Mr Beard had represented Microsoft in the late stages of hearings with the CMA, before the regulator blocked the takeover in April.An appeal at the Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT) is likely to take several months, beyond the July 18 deadline for the two companies to complete the deal. The timeline is already likely to be extended because US regulators have launched a legal challenge to the deal.If Microsoft successfully appeals the CMA’s ruling, the case can be sent back to the regulator to reconsider its decision. If the CAT refuses the case, the company can then take the case to the Court of Appeal.In addition to representing Apple and Intel, Mr Beard represented Sky in seeking to overturn a 2007 Government decision that the broadcaster must sell down its stake in ITV, which it eventually lost. He also argued for Tesco in 2009 as the supermarket overturned a Competition Commission ruling that planning permission for new stores should require a competition test.Microsoft has said it remains “fully committed” to the deal despite the CMA block. Activision’s chief executive Bobby Kotick has said the company will support Microsoft’s appeal.He said when the deal was blocked: “We’re confident in our case because the facts are on our side: this deal is good for competition.”Mr Kotick has said that over regulation will mean the company reassessing its growth plans in the UK.The Government plans to grant the CMA new powers to issue hefty fines to tech companies that are seen as abusing their position.Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

MSFT,Meta Platforms scoops up AI networking chip team from Graphcore,"By Katie Paul(Reuters) - Meta Platforms Inc has hired an Oslo-based team that until late last year was building artificial-intelligence networking technology at British chip unicorn Graphcore.A Meta spokesperson confirmed the hirings in response to a request for comment, after Reuters identified 10 people whose LinkedIn profiles said they worked at Graphcore until December 2022 or January 2023 and subsequently joined Meta in February or March of this year.""We recently welcomed a number of highly-specialized engineers in Oslo to our infrastructure team at Meta. They bring deep expertise in the design and development of supercomputing systems to support AI and machine learning at scale in Meta's data centers,"" said Jon Carvill, the Meta spokesperson.The move brings additional muscle to the social media giant's bid to improve how its data centers handle AI work, as it races to cope with demand for AI-oriented infrastructure from teams across the company looking to build new features.Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, has become increasingly reliant on AI technology to target advertising, select posts for its apps' feeds and purge banned content from its platforms.On top of that, it is now rushing to join competitors like Microsoft Corp and Alphabet Inc's Google in releasing generative AI products capable of creating human-like writing, art and other content, which investors see as the next big growth area for tech companies.The 10 employees' job descriptions on LinkedIn indicated the team had worked on AI-specific networking technology at Graphcore, which develops computer chips and systems optimized for AI work.Carvill declined to say what they would be working on at Meta.Graphcore closed its Oslo office as part of a broader restructuring announced in October last year, a spokesperson for the startup said, as it struggled to make inroads against U.S.-based firms like Nvidia Corp and Advanced Micro Devices Inc which dominate the market for AI chips.Meta already has an in-house unit designing several kinds of chips aimed at speeding up and maximizing efficiency for its AI work, including a network chip that performs a sort of air traffic control function for servers, two sources told Reuters.Efficient networking is especially useful for modern AI systems like those behind chatbot ChatGPT or image-generation tool Dall-E, which are far too large to fit onto a single computing chip and must instead be split up over many chips strung together.A new category of network chip has emerged to help keep data moving smoothly within those computing clusters. Nvidia, AMD and Intel Corp all make such network chips.In addition to its network chip, Meta is also designing a complex computing chip to both train AI models and perform inference, a process in which the trained models make judgments and generate responses to prompts, although it does not expect that chip to be ready until around 2025.Graphcore, one of the UK's most valuable tech startups, once was seen by investors like Microsoft and venture capital firm Sequoia as a promising potential challenger to Nvidia's commanding lead in the market for AI chip systems.However, it faced a setback in 2020 when Microsoft scrapped an early deal to buy Graphcore's chips for its Azure cloud computing platform, according to a report by UK newspaper The Times. Microsoft instead used Nvidia's GPUs to build the massive infrastructure powering ChatGPT developer OpenAI, which Microsoft also backs.Sequoia has since written down its investment in Graphcore to zero, although it remains on the company's board, according to a source familiar with the relationship. The write-down was first reported by Insider in October.The Graphcore spokesperson confirmed the setbacks, but said the company was ""perfectly positioned"" to take advantage of accelerating commercial adoption of AI.Graphcore was last valued at $2.8 billion after raising $222 million in its most recent investment round in 2020.(Reporting by Katie Paul and Krystal Hu in New York and Stephen Nellis in San Francisco; Editing by Kenneth Li and Matthew Lewis)","May 5, 2023 at 8:31 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meta-platforms-scoops-ai-networking-133156555.html,Reuters,0.0,0.0,0.12305562917807816,0.4167424978649468

MSFT,13 Habits That Helped Bill Gates Build His $110 Billion Fortune,"These days, Gates is more interested in giving his money away than he is in acquiring more. In 2010, Gates -- along with his now ex-wife, Melinda, and fellow multi-billionaire Warren Buffett -- co-founded The Giving Pledge, which encourages the world's wealthiest people to give away most of their fortunes to charity. He has donated at least $35.8 billion in stock from Microsoft, the company he co-founded, to his own Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, according to Forbes. In 2021, they made a multiyear pledge of $15 billion to the foundation, The Chronicle of Philanthropy reported.Gates attended Harvard University only briefly before he dropped out, yet he attributes his time there to his success.""It was an amazing privilege (studying at Harvard); and, though I left early, I was transformed by my years at Harvard, the friendships I made, and the ideas I worked on,"" Gates said in a 2007 commencement speech.Gates studied computers, but he also dabbled in many other subjects that interested him at the Ivy League school.""Academic life was fascinating,"" he said during the speech. ""I used to sit in on lots of classes I hadn't even signed up for.""This thirst for knowledge and his willingness to always improve and learn contributed to the growth of his eventual business.He remains a staunch supporter of education. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation launched the Global Education Program in 2018 with a focus on teaching reading and math skills to primary school children in sub-Saharan Africa and India.When asked in 1998 about his role models, Gates said he looked up to his parents. Gates' parents nurtured and supported his interest in computers as well -- even after he decided to abandon his Harvard education. Gates' father, Bill Gates Sr., told Forbes that his son's decision to drop out of college ""wasn't precisely what my wife and I had envisioned for any of our children.""However, Gates' parents were extremely supportive of his endeavors after that. After Gates' mother died in 1994, she helped her son ""get the contract that led to a lucrative relationship with IBM for his fledgling Microsoft Corporation,"" according to The New York Times.As for his father, Gates long cited him as an inspiration for his philanthropic work, which has dominated the younger Gates' time and energies since he left his day-to-day work at Microsoft in 2008. The elder Gates was actively involved in his son's philanthropic work -- he even wrote the first check for Gates' foundation -- until his death in 2020 at the age of 94.Bill Gates is the father of three children -- daughters Jennifer and Phoebe, born in 1996 and 2002, and son Rory, born in 1999. In interviews and speeches, he has given his ex-wife credit for 80% of the child rearing and said they followed the ""love and logic"" parenting method of the 1970s.In the Forbes interview, Gates' father said his son was an incredibly avid reader as a child.""Just about every kind of book interested him -- encyclopedias, science fiction, you name it,"" he said. ""I was thrilled that my child was such an avid reader, but he read so much that Bill's mother and I had to institute a rule: no books at the dinner table.""That hasn't changed. In 2021, in honor of World Book Day, he tweeted about his passion.""I try to read every day, whether I have a busy day at the office or am out for a hike,"" he wrote. ""It's one of my favorite ways to learn new things and better understand the world.""Reading likely contributed to Gates' net worth, as it helped provide him with the knowledge he would need to become a successful entrepreneur. He recommends books on his blog, GatesNotes.Gates has made countless brilliant business decisions, many of which have involved the people he has chosen to work with.""I'd say my best business decisions really have to do with picking people,"" Gates said in the 1998 interview. ""Deciding to go into partnership with Paul Allen is probably at the top of the list.""Allen and Gates were friends growing up, and they co-founded Microsoft in 1975. Allen left the company eight years later, after being diagnosed with Hodgkin's disease. A fellow philanthropist who gave away more than $2 billion, Allen owned the NFL's Seattle Seahawks and the NBA's Portland Trail Blazers at the time of his death, at age 65, in 2018 from complications of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.Throughout the years, Gates and Allen had a ""complex relationship,"" as outlined in Allen's book, ""Idea Man: A Memoir by the Cofounder of Microsoft."" However, Gates attributes Microsoft's early success to his partnership with Allen and the many lessons they learned along the way.As many entrepreneurs have said, you must love what you do if you hope to be successful. Bill Gates fell in love with computers as a child and spent a lifetime building one of the most successful businesses in the world.""You've got to enjoy what you do every day, and for me that's working with very smart people,"" Gates said in 1998. ""It's working on new problems. ... The competition, the breakthroughs, the research make the field I'm in, I think, the most exciting field there is.""Even though he left his day-to-day role at Microsoft more than a decade ago, Gates served as Microsoft's chairman of the board. In 2020, however, he left the board to focus solely on his philanthropic work.Gates was fortunate to attend Lakeside School, an elite private school in Seattle that gave him access to computers when he was in the seventh grade. Instead of just teaching students how to use computers in the conventional sense, the school ""unleashed"" them, according to Gates. Looking back, he said his experiences at the school gave him the vision and encouragement he needed to do the impossible.His vision continues today, though on a different front. His aim now is to better arm the world to fight the threat from future pandemics. The Gates Foundation, as of January 2022, had given more than $2 billion to vaccines and other efforts related to COVID-19.Gates has written a book, ""How to Prevent the Next Pandemic,"" which is due for release on May 3, 2022.Gates learned early that, in order to be successful, he had to amass a large emergency fund for Microsoft, which would keep the business afloat if it ever encountered financial obstacles.""I always had to be careful that we wouldn't hire too many people,"" he said in a 2018 interview on ""The Ellen DeGeneres Show."" ""I was always worried because people who worked for me were older than me and had kids, and I always thought, 'What if we don't get paid? Will I be able to meet the payroll?'""Everyone makes mistakes, including Gates. The key, however, is to learn from those errors, and that's exactly what Gates has done.At a 2019 Village Global event, Gates said his biggest mistake was not jumping into competition with Apple after it released its first iPhone in June 2007. Google did just that with its Android device in 2008.""These are winner-takes-all markets. So the greatest mistake ever is whatever mismanagement I engaged in that caused Microsoft not to be what Android is,"" he said. ""That was a natural thing for Microsoft to win.""Although many successful businessmen like to brag about how little sleep they get, Gates is the opposite. He knows he's not superhuman and that sleep is required for his intellectual curiosity to be at its best.""I like to get seven hours of sleep,"" he told The Seattle Times in 1990. ""Even though it's fun to stay up all night -- maybe taking a red-eye flight -- if I have to be creative, I need seven hours.""He hasn't changed his mind in the ensuing years. In a December 2019 post on his blog, he doubled down. ""Does everyone really need seven or eight hours of sleep a night?"" he pondered. ""The answer is that you almost certainly do, even if you've convinced yourself otherwise. In the words of Dr. Thomas Roth, of the Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit, 'The number of people who can survive on five hours of sleep or less without impairment, and rounded to a whole number, is zero.'Gates and legendary entrepreneur Warren Buffett became friends 30 years ago when the two met over Fourth of July weekend in 1991 in Seattle by chance -- not through business. Gates celebrated that friendship -- and Buffett's 90th birthday -- in a blog post in 2020 and discussed one of the ways Buffett has influenced him.""As Warren himself put it a few years ago when we spoke with some college students, 'You will move in the direction of the people that you associate with. So it's important to associate with people that are better than yourself,'"" Gates wrote. ""The friends you have will form you as you go through life. Make some good friends, keep them for the rest of your life, but have them be people that you admire as well as like.""When Gates was building Microsoft, he put most of his time, energy and creative talent into making it arguably the greatest tech company in the world. Once he got rich, however, he did what most financial advisors recommend investors do regardless of their net worth: He diversified. At the time he stepped down from the Microsoft board in March 2020, he owned about 1% of the company's stock, Forbes reported. He then used the cash to invest in a wide range of stocks and other assets that protected his massive portfolio from a single-security calamity. Forbes said he holds stock in Canadian National Railway and AutoNation and that he is among the largest owners of American farmland. CNBC reported in April 2022 that he also is an investor in Motif FoodWorks, a plant-based food company.Microsoft's partnership with IBM formed the backbone of the 1980s personal computer revolution. The two companies collaborated to create the operating systems that breathed life into most PCs. By the early 1990s, however, the partnership had stagnated and Gates determined Microsoft would be better going it alone.The gamble paid off.When the separation was complete in 1992, IBM walked away with the jointly created OS/2 operating system and Microsoft left with the software that would make it king: MS-DOS and Windows. In 2016, Forbes wrote of Gates, ""His decision to divorce IBM stands as one of his best. Microsoft took control over its own destiny.""According to a 2019 report from Inc., Gates found success only after he learned to trust the people he hired and delegate responsibility to them. That, however, required Gates to do something that was antithetical to his entire personality: Forfeit control.In Microsoft's early years, Gates maintained a tight grasp on everything that happened and did whatever he could himself, but how could he grow Microsoft to its full potential if he spent all day writing or editing code? He couldn't.Instead, he developed relationships with key employees, and those relationships were based on mutual trust. He found that the new mentality allowed him to take on the role of mentor instead of micromanager, which, it turns out, suited him well.This ability to be creative, work with his team and have a big enough cash cushion to continuously grow and try new things contributed greatly to Microsoft's success and, eventually, Gates' fortune.As many entrepreneurs have said, you must love what you do if you hope to be successful. Bill Gates fell in love with computers as a child and spent a lifetime building one of the most successful businesses in the world.""You've got to enjoy what you do every day, and for me that's working with very smart people,"" Gates said in 1998. ""It's working on new problems. ... The competition, the breakthroughs, the research make the field I'm in, I think, the most exciting field there is.""Even though he left his day-to-day role at Microsoft more than a decade ago, Gates served as Microsoft's chairman of the board. In 2020, however, he left the board to focus solely on his philanthropic work. As the COVID-19 pandemic swept the world, Gates reinvented himself again by emerging as a leading advocate for science-based policy in government while donating hundreds of millions of dollars to coronavirus-related research and causes.More From GOBankingRates5 Expensive Renovations Homeowners Always RegretFinancial Insight in Your Inbox: Sign Up for GBR's Daily Newsletter3 Ways to Recession Proof Your Retirement7 Things You Must Do To Create a Plan for Your Money","May 5, 2023 at 8:01 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/13-habits-helped-bill-gates-120014069.html,GOBankingRates,0.0,0.0,0.25871727478870327,0.4675390641104925

MSFT,Advent of ChatGPT: Boon/Bane to Cybersecurity ETFs?,"OpenAI's GPT-4 – the advanced AI language model – has both positive and negative cybersecurity implications, as discussed at the RSA Conference 2023, as quoted on tchtarget.com. Sessions highlighted malicious uses of large language models such as generating disinformation and constructing social engineering schemes. However, some speakers also noted that GPT-4 can be leveraged positively in cybersecurity.At the RSA Conference 2023, speakers discussed ChatGPT's potential for both positive and negative cybersecurity use, with an expectation for increased attacks and code reuse. OpenAI Playground offers a platform for testing different permutations of OpenAI models for cybersecurity. Tech companies are already integrating OpenAI into products, such as reducing low-risk tasks for short-staffed security teams.Microsoft's Security Copilot, which is powered by the company's GPT-4 model, utilizes verified data sources, Microsoft Defender Threat Intelligence, and Microsoft Sentinel to assist professional security teams with incident response, threat hunting, and security reporting. The tool is designed to enhance the efficiency of security operations center analysts.ChatGPT poses a new cybersecurity threat, particularly in the form of AI-generated phishing scams. Cybersecurity leaders need to equip their IT teams with tools to detect AI-generated emails and train employees on cybersecurity prevention skills, while advocating for advanced detection tools and government oversight of AI usage in cybersecurity, per Harvard Business Review.Hackers may be able to manipulate ChatGPT into generating hacking code, posing a new cybersecurity threat. Cybersecurity professionals need to continuously upskill and be equipped with AI technology to detect and defend against AI-generated hacker code.While ChatGPT's power is available to both good and bad actors, it's essential to prevent ChatGPT-related threats and instruct cybersecurity professionals on how to use it as a tool in their arsenal. As ChatGPT continues to improve, it may become an increasingly prevailing tool for malicious actors.Overall, software developers should create generative AI specifically for human-filled Security Operations Centers (SOCs). Stricter regulations are needed in exercising this AI.  The release of the ""Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights"" by the Biden administration is now even more critical following the launch of ChatGPT.ETFMG Prime Cyber Security ETF (HACK): ETF Research ReportsFirst Trust NASDAQ Cybersecurity ETF (CIBR): ETF Research ReportsiShares Cybersecurity and Tech ETF (IHAK): ETF Research ReportsWisdomTree Cybersecurity Fund (WCBR): ETF Research ReportsTo read this article on Zacks.com click here.Zacks Investment Research","May 5, 2023 at 7:00 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/advent-chatgpt-boon-bane-cybersecurity-120012730.html,Zacks,0.0,0.0,0.11366041366041364,0.45058120891454223
MSFT,Q1 2023 Jamf Holding Corp Earnings Call,"Dean J. Hager; CEO & Director; Jamf Holding Corp.Ian Goodkind; CFO & CAO; Jamf Holding Corp.Jennifer Gaumond; IR Officer; Jamf Holding Corp.John Strosahl; COO & President; Jamf Holding Corp.Joshua Christopher Reilly; Senior Analyst; Needham & Company, LLC, Research DivisionKoji Ikeda; VP & Research Analyst; BofA Securities, Research DivisionMatthew George Hedberg; Analyst; RBC Capital Markets, Research DivisionNicholas Paul Mattiacci; Associate Analyst; Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research DivisionRaimo Lenschow; MD & Analyst; Barclays Bank PLC, Research DivisionUnidentified AnalystOperatorJennifer GaumondDean J. HagerJohn StrosahlIan GoodkindOperatorMatthew George HedbergGreat. And first of all, congrats, Dean, first on your retirement. That is exciting news for you. And John, obviously, on your promotion, it certainly seems like the company is in really good hands here on a go-forward basis. So congrats to both of you. John, maybe for you, and I'll keep it to one question for the sake of time. What continues to resonate with us and when we talk to channel partners is the success you're having on the security side. And you spent a lot of time in your script, and obviously, you talked about Okta as well. I'm curious, as device adds are under pressure, how much of a -- like that initial land is like both device management and security. Because I have to imagine that's become increasingly -- in focus today on some of those initial lands versus just a straight upsell.John StrosahlYes. Matt, thanks for the question. And you're absolutely right. It's the security adding of the security products has given us many more vectors into a customer (inaudible) customer may have one device management per device, they can certainly have 5 different security products. And so we've had (inaudible) large deals actually this last quarter were security (inaudible) and we've expanded from there. So we really -- we're bullish on that. We've had great success in our business plan, especially in the SMB area, which includes, of course, our security products as well. And we will continue to invest accordingly.OperatorAnd our next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow from Barclays.Raimo LenschowCongrats from me as well, Dean, although if you retire, I feel really old because I don't think you're that old (inaudible). Quick question. If you think as a seat-based model, obviously, with the economy suffering, you kind of suffered a little bit. But like where are we do you think on the journey in terms of normalization in terms of customers kind of thinking about their deployment, their deployment size, et cetera. It's obviously a journey like -- how do you feel about your customer conversations where we are on that journey? And then I have one follow-up.Dean J. HagerThanks, Raimo, for the question. And just for clarity, are you speaking like in terms of our penetration within the devices for our customers? Are you thinking more on where we're at from a market perspective on device shipments?Raimo LenschowMore on the latter, actually, like device shipments and how that's kind of playing out?Dean J. HagerRaimo LenschowYes. Okay. Perfect. And then on the follow-up, like you had a few price increases for Pro and other product lines at the beginning of the year. Has that impact -- like what's the impact here on ARR? Is that like meaningful? Is that coming through all in one? Or how should we think about that?Ian GoodkindYes. I can jump in here, Dean, yes. Thanks for the question. Yes, the impact on ARR is just pennies. I mean we just announced it, customers are just getting into it. We have a ton of customers that will come in, in the latter half, that will impact. But right now, that's a de minimis impact. What's really driving that, again, is our security posture. And John talked about it earlier, where we're starting to get really savvy and we're starting to see really good business plan sales, and that's helping drive it.Dean J. HagerThe good news is that the receptivity from our customers on the price increase has been positive that there is significant more value that's delivered, and seems to be being received well.OperatorAnd our next question comes from the line of (inaudible) from William Blair.Unidentified AnalystThis is (inaudible). Also echoing the congratulations, Dean and John, excited to work with you more in the future. So just one for me on the macroeconomic environment. Do you -- are there any further updates you have to share from any observations in the first quarter and into April and early May? Any particular areas of strength or weakness you could call out?Dean J. HagerUnidentified AnalystGot it. Perfect. And then just one quick other follow-up for me. You touched on it a little bit in your prepared remarks, but is there anything else that you have to -- you could comment on with customer buying behavior in this environment? Have you seen customers reduce any deployments? Or are they just a little slower to expand?John StrosahlYes. Alex, I'll take that. This is John. Thanks for the question. We have. We have. It's similar across the industry. Companies are taking a little longer to discern whether or not they're going to spend. They're waiting a bit to see the line of sight. We've been able to offset that in many cases by having a broader variety of products to sell into them. But we are seeing some more judicious approach from our customers just like we're taking ourselves internally.OperatorOne moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Joshua Reilly from Needham & Company.Joshua Christopher ReillyI'll put out my congrats as well to both Dean and John there. If you look at the M2 cycle for Apple here versus the M1 launch, our work indicates that the material change in power consumption price and security with M1, and the M2 kind of still offers a similar value proposition so that wave of initial upgrade with M1 isn't as strong with M2. Can you just comment, is that what you're seeing as well? And does that create a tough comp for you this year in addition to the macro challenges that we're seeing in the market?Dean J. HagerThanks for the question, Josh. But I don't know that I'd be an expert on that in terms of the uptake on the M2 versus M1. We haven't really seen dialogue within our customers of that, that would either (inaudible) deployment. More so from our perspective, it really comes down to what is the price (inaudible) efficiency versus an alternative non-Mac computer and then, of course (inaudible). And as you well know, back in the day, they used to have to battle against user preference versus the (inaudible). But today's price performance, the Mac is not a more expensive machine. As a matter of fact, I have (inaudible) provide very strong cases. As a matter of fact, I was (inaudible) last week, talking about the cost advantages of buying specifically the MacBook Air. So if you look over the last year, I mentioned in my commentary, for the last 4 quarters, not one quarter but 4 quarters, the Mac decline year-over-year is 6% versus 23% for non-Mac computers. So that's really what our focus is.Joshua Christopher ReillyGot it. That's helpful. And then if you look at the year-over-year device growth of 13%, that's actually pretty strong off a tough comp in the current macro, I think. And while the ARR (inaudible) device growth did slow a bit sequentially. What are you seeing in terms of cross-sell trends and the mix of devices that were actually sold in the quarter? And was there some more education devices sold in this quarter ahead of the buying season that might have impacted that?Dean J. HagerYes. So not necessarily on the education side. But it's -- (inaudible) to recognize the fact that we grew devices in this atmosphere by 13% over the year. To be perfectly honest, when we look at our year-over-year expansion of Mac devices specifically in commercial markets, in some ways, it's kind of surprising given the overall shipment numbers of Mac in the last year. And what that tells us is Jamf is just winning a larger share. So therefore, (inaudible) there's just a lot of under-managed and under-secured Mac out there still. So even though the Mac did grow in shipments over the last year, we still did. That bodes pretty well for when we believe the device shipments will normalize and come back.OperatorOne moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Koji Ikeda from Bank of America.Koji IkedaI echo everyone's sentiment here. Congrats, Dean on the retirement. Congrats, John. Just a couple of questions for me. Dean, just starting off with you, I guess, kind of going back to the why now, and I want to frame this question a little bit differently. I totally get it on the personal front. The announcement of John makes a whole lot of sense, I totally get it. But what did you see from the business side that made you kind of made that, help ease your decision for the why now?Dean J. HagerJohn, the fact that John is here. I mean he and I have been partnered in this for the last 8 years now. And for anybody watching closely, I mean, let's face it, John was Chief Revenue Officer when I (inaudible) to join us. And then about 2.5 years ago to Chief Operating Officer. And then 1.5 years ago to President, and most of the company has been reporting up to him. So frankly, as we looked at the organization and John has really been running things, it just made that decision all the easier. As I mentioned, this has really been a part of a long-term plan for -- with myself and my wife, Jenny. And so just knowing that the company is in such good hands, made it an easy decision.Koji IkedaGot it. Got it. That's helpful. And I guess since the spotlight is on John, question directed to you. Just kind of thinking about -- in the past, maybe, in the easier times or the better times of 2020 and 2021, when companies were buying units in anticipation of hiring. How do we think about the effects of that more just-in-time mentality as we think about 2023 and 2024? And really, the question here is when do you think we could start maybe (inaudible) or the comps get easier from this change in buying patterns?John StrosahlYes. Thanks, Koji. We've talked a lot about the macroeconomics. You've heard a lot on other earnings calls. And as we see the headwinds for device shipments (inaudible) we've taken an opportunity during that time to really learn how to better sell security and get that muscle memory going. And so the reports we're looking at can suggest that -- and we plan this way that we'll look for headwinds to the end of the year. As device shipments come back and device expansion comes back, we anticipate early next year, we've got a great tailwind of not having just a device on that device expansion -- device management, but then also security on top of that. And so that's really what we are planning around.OperatorNicholas Paul MattiacciThis is Nick on for Chad Bennett. Just one for me. If you could talk about how your partner channel has been performing and if there are any geographies, verticals or other segments where channel partners are becoming more impactful? And then on Apple specifically, if anything has changed in regard to your go-to-market relationship?Dean J. HagerYou want to grab that, John?John StrosahlYes, I'll take that. So if I understand the question, Nick, is how are we working with our channel and how is that advancing. Obviously, the channel partners that we work with now also work with Apple. And Apple is in fact, a channel (inaudible) on the education side. We've put a concerted effort into building our channel organization with the vast majority of our sales coming internationally through the channel and increasingly the amount coming in the U.S. through our channel partners as well. So we're going to continue that because we believe there's great efficiencies there. We've seen, and as I mentioned, great traction outside the United States, and we're learning a lot from that and bringing that into the U.S. as well to gain more efficiencies in our go-to-market through the channel.Dean J. HagerThe one other thing I'll just add on top of that is -- and John commented on it that we continue to expand our go-to-market relationships like we did with -- entering (inaudible) program with Microsoft, which is a good -- while not a co-selling relationship (inaudible) co-marketing relationship, but the AWS relationship is a co-selling relationship. It was really our very first quarter after launching us as part of the AWS Marketplace, and we couldn't have been happier with the traction that we saw that in Q1, and we think that's going to build over time.OperatorThis does conclude the question-and-answer session as well as today's program.

Obviously, it's a journey for customers and there is like the initial steps. And then there's a follow-on. So if you think about the customer behavior in terms of what they do on optimization, is that still -- are you still seeing the same steps that are getting taken? Or are we going to kind of round 2, round 3, et cetera? So I'm just trying to understand a little bit where we are on that optimization journey if you have more color. And then I have one follow-up, please.Olivier PomelRaimo LenschowYes. Okay. Perfect. And then, David, on the cost side, so thanks for giving us the OpEx rate for the year and the exit rate.

And so with this new sort of compute cycle that we're about to embark on, what do you see -- how are sort of applications and the sort of the application stack, how is that going to change?

Can you possibly shed a little more light? For instance, will you recapture that or some of that in Q2? And what type of customer and customer dynamic is operating at that level? And then I have a quick follow-up.David M. ObstlerYes. We -- that is a customer of ours. What we said was the billing frequency changed and the size. So that customer's bill will, one, be spread out more over time. That company -- that was a crypto company and continues to be a customer of ours, but that was an early optimizer. We had always talked that some of the industries that were most affected optimized. And that is -- so we will get that -- we will get that bill at a smaller size than was billed last year in a more of a chunked up billing way.Olivier PomelAnd look, this is one of the situations where this customer was in an industry that -- vertical that got pretty much decimated over the past year. And their own business was cut in 3 or 4 in terms of their revenue. And when that's the case, that we really work with customers to restructure their contract with us. We want to be part of the solution for them, not part of the problem. And that's what we did here, we restructured that contract. So we kept them as a happy customer for many more years and do deal that works for everyone with their business profile.David M. ObstlerIn our company - since we've been public, we've pointed out when we have an unusual bill. So we don't have multiple of these types of situations. And what we've done, if you look back to our commentary, is when we've had one of those, a change of timing or a change of the duration of a bill or a size of a bill. We've tried to pro forma it in order to give everyone a sense of what the rest of the business is doing.Mark Ronald MurphyThat's much appreciated on our part. And as a follow-up, Olivier, congrats on passing $2 billion in ARR, one of the fastest software companies ever to do that, pretty amazing. I did want to ask you as well on the optimizations. At the moment, Microsoft seems more optimistic that the optimization activity would start to normalize in the next couple or few quarters than Amazon does. And when we tear it apart, Azure has less exposure to tech companies which are doing layoffs. They have more exposure to generative AI, which is booming relative to AWS. So I'm wondering if that part lines up with your telemetry and your forecasting that perhaps your Azure monitoring business is going to start to turn the corner sooner, and then perhaps AWS would follow after that.Olivier PomelOperatorPlease stand by for our next question. The next question comes from Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs.Kasthuri Gopalan RanganI was curious, Olivier, that the generative AI, is it merely a fact of just waiting for these workloads to come on? And since you have such a strong presence in infrastructure monitoring, these workloads will just run on these big clouds and you will optimize them? Or do you have to do something specific on the product side to tool Datadog to better handle these generative AI workload? And I have a follow-up question.Olivier PomelKasthuri Gopalan RanganGot it. And also Microsoft talked about the anniversary effect of optimization that the headwinds would be less going forward, whereas AWS called out deceleration in the month of April. But it looks like your business is still steady in the month of April. So it's fair to say that you're sort of decoupling away from the AWS deceleration and maintaining its steady pace as far as consumption trends are concerned.Olivier PomelOperatorPlease stand by for the next question. The next question comes from Fatima Boolani with Citi.Unidentified AnalystThis is [Joel] on for Fatima. So just to check in another vertical here. Given the continued uncertainty in the financial services vertical, just wondering if you could speak to your exposure here and perhaps any related behavior you're seeing with your customers, if at all? And then I just have a quick follow-up.Olivier PomelUnidentified AnalystOkay. And then just -- you mentioned the expansion deal with a large fintech, which displaced open source software in addition to other tools. So I just wondered if you could speak to the competitive dynamics versus open source, especially in this cost-sensitive environment and why Datadog still wins and perhaps works as a consolidation destination.Olivier PomelOperatorPlease stand by for our next question. The next question comes from Brad Reback with Stifel.Brad Robert RebackOlivier, Earlier, you mentioned sort of the opportunity or your sort of focus on the Azure ecosystem. What types of things on a go-to-market perspective can you do to increase your penetration there as you've sort of historically been much larger inside of AWS?Olivier PomelOperatorPlease stand by for our next question. The next question comes from Matt Hedberg with RBC.Matthew George HedbergThanks for the APM and log management data point, over $1 billion in ARR. I'm wondering, can you provide a frame of reference for maybe the growth of these 2 businesses versus core infrastructure? And maybe between the 2 APM logging, are they about equal in size? Or is one sort of relatively larger than the other?Olivier PomelAlthough it might look the same, I mean we're not going to give specific numbers there. But -- and the growth rates, of course, like the -- generally speaking, the smaller products grow faster than the products that are bigger than them. That's pretty much true over the whole set of products. The growth of all of the products have come down a little bit, especially the ones that have a lot of volume component, like, for example, logs, where if you -- when you think of optimization, like there is optimization that happens at the cloud provider level and there some that can happen at the observability level, too. Overwhelmingly, at the observability level, that's logged and everything that's for which customers have different knob to turn. For everything else, it's the utilization to where the cloud provide (inaudible).Matthew George HedbergGot it. And then on the outage that you referenced, the $5 million. I'm curious, what did you guys learn from that to prevent maybe this in the future? And outside of the $5 million hit that David talked about, are there any other repercussions from a customer perspective?Olivier PomelOperatorPlease stand by for our next question. The next question comes from Brent Thill with Jefferies.Brent John ThillDavid, just on the large customer adds, you were at 130 versus an average of 170 to 240 over the last 4 quarters. Any color there? Can you just talk to, is this just more customer selling because of the economy? Or is this execution-related? How would you the characterize the large enterprise traction?David M. ObstlerBrent John ThillAnd Olivier, just a quick follow-up on the cloud authorization solution. Are you -- can you give us a sense of the traction of what you're seeing in terms of adoption there?Olivier PomelAdjustment for what? Sorry, I missed the beginning of your question.Brent John ThillEven build a cloud optimization solution to help your customers identify where there's potential opportunities, are you seeing an uptake in that product?Olivier PomelYes, we're seeing extremely strong demand for that. And this is -- so this is definitely a product that customers want. And we -- and our immediate road map for it is very clear. So that's -- there's no doubt about it.OperatorPlease stand by for our next question. The next question comes from Koji Ikeda with Bank of America Securities.Koji IkedaJust one for me here in the interest of time. I wanted to ask you a question on the cloud security management platform and specifically the sales motion for it. So how is that shaping up this year? And how should we be thinking about the investments and strategy for that segment this year? And as you attack that opportunity, how has the competitive environment been shaping up as you head into deal bake-offs? Is it coming in as expected?Olivier PomelOperatorPlease stand by for our next question. The next question comes from Gregg Moskowitz with Mizuho.Gregg Steven MoskowitzOkay. Olivier, you laid out a pretty compelling case for why generative AI will have a positive impact on Datadog and presumably the observability market at large, both over the near to medium term as well as long term. But do you see any offsets, any partial offsets from organizations having greater intelligence and automation at their fingertips? Are there certain workloads that may no longer need to be monitored by an observability platform?Olivier PomelGregg Steven MoskowitzOkay. Got it. And then just for David, on the outage, are the credits, et cetera, is that now fully behind you? Or is there any lingering financial impact in the Q2 that you're embedding in the guide?David M. ObstlerYes. We provide for what we know in our -- at time in our accruals. So we believe that we've provided for that through the revenue impact in Q1.OperatorPlease standby for our last question. The last question comes from Mike Cikos with Needham.Michael Joseph CikosOlivier PomelOperatorI would now like to turn the call over to Olivier for closing remarks.Olivier PomelThank you. I want to thank again all -- everyone at Datadog for crossing these really important milestones. Obviously, we're already focused on the next ones. But I want to thank everyone for their hard work, shipping product, getting in front of customers. I also want to thank our team for responding to that system outage we had and our customers for very kindly working with us through that. And on this, I will speak to you again after Q2.OperatorThis concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

MSFT,Microsoft Working With AMD on Expansion Into AI Processors,"(Bloomberg) -- Microsoft Corp. is working with Advanced Micro Devices Inc. on the chipmaker’s expansion into artificial intelligence processors, according to people with knowledge of the situation, part of a multipronged strategy to secure more of the highly coveted components.Most Read from BloombergTexas Mass Shooting’s Bloody Images Add to Fervor in Gun DebatePowell’s Bet Against Recession Looks Good — Minus the Credit Crunch and a DC StandoffFootball Stadiums Belong in the SuburbsBiden Trails Trump as His Approval Rating Hits Low in ABC PollSingapore’s Soaring Rents Are Becoming a Political ProblemThe companies are teaming up to offer an alternative to Nvidia Corp., which dominates the market for AI-capable chips called graphics processing units, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the matter is private. The software giant is providing support to bolster AMD’s efforts, including engineering resources, and working with the chipmaker on a homegrown Microsoft processor for AI workloads, code-named Athena, the people said.Frank Shaw, a Microsoft spokesman, denied that AMD is part of Athena. “AMD is a great partner,” he said. “However, they are not involved in Athena.”AMD shares jumped more than 6.5% on Thursday, and Microsoft gained about 1%. AMD representatives declined to comment. Nvidia stock declined 1.9%.The arrangement is part of a broader rush to augment AI processing power, which is in great demand after the explosion of chatbots like ChatGPT and other services based on the technology. Microsoft is both a top provider of cloud-computing services and a driving force of AI use. The company has pumped $10 billion into ChatGPT maker OpenAI, and has vowed to add such features to its entire software lineup.Read More: Microsoft to Bring OpenAI’s Chatbot Technology to Office AppsThe move also reflects Microsoft’s deepening involvement in the chip industry. The company has been building up a silicon division over the past several years under former Intel Corp. executive Rani Borkar, and the group now has a staff of almost 1,000 employees. The Information last month reported on Microsoft’s development of the Athena artificial-intelligence chip.Several hundred of those employees are working on the Athena project, and Microsoft has spent about $2 billion on its chip efforts, according to one of the people. But the undertaking doesn’t portend a split with Nvidia. Microsoft intends to keep working closely with that company, whose chips are the workhorses for training and running AI systems. It’s also trying to find ways to get more Nvidia’s processors, underscoring the urgent shortage Microsoft and others are facing.Microsoft’s relationship with OpenAI — and its own slate of newly introduced AI services — are requiring computing power at a level beyond what the company expected when it ordered chips and set up data centers. OpenAI’s ChatGPT service has drawn interest from businesses that want to use it as part of their own products or corporate applications, and Microsoft has introduced a chat-based version of Bing and new AI-enhanced Office tools.It’s also updating older products like GitHub’s code-generating tool. All of those AI programs run in Microsoft’s Azure cloud and require the pricey and powerful processors Nvidia provides.The area is also a key priority for AMD. “We are very excited about our opportunity in AI — this is our No. 1 strategic priority,” Chief Executive Officer Lisa Su said during the chipmaker’s earnings call Tuesday. “We are in the very early stages of the AI computing era, and the rate of adoption and growth is faster than any other technology in recent history.”Su also said that AMD has an opportunity to make partly customized chips for its biggest customers to use in their AI data centers.From Bloomberg Businessweek: Doing, Not Just Chatting, Is the Next Stage of the AI Hype CycleBorkar’s team at Microsoft, which has also worked on chips for servers and Surface computers, is now prioritizing the Athena project. It’s developing a graphics processing unit that can be used for training and running AI models. The product is already being tested internally and could be more widely available as soon as next year, said one of the people.Even if the project makes that timeline, a first version is just a starting point, the people said. It takes years to build a good chip, and Nvidia has a substantial head start. Nvidia is the chip supplier of choice for many providers of tools for generative AI, including Amazon.com Inc.’s AWS and Google cloud, and Elon Musk has secured thousands of its processors for his fledgling AI business, according to reports.Creating an alternative to Nvidia’s lineup will be a challenging task. That company offers a package of software and hardware that works together — including chips, a programming language, networking equipment and servers — letting customers rapidly upgrade their capabilities.That’s one of the reasons Nvidia has become so dominant. But Microsoft isn’t alone in trying to develop in-house AI processors. Cloud rival Amazon acquired Annapurna Labs in 2016 and has developed two different AI processors. Alphabet Inc.’s Google also has a training chip of its own.(Adds Microsoft comment in third paragraph.

Some people pooh-poohing on Apple, saying that the slowdown in North American sales not great, and that Apple's heyday is over. We hear that constantly, that Apple's heyday is over, and then they go out and beat expectations. So whether or not there's a new huge product coming, we don't know.Maybe we'll see with WWDC coming up in June. Could be AR/VR glasses. Could be nothing. Maybe it's a car. I don't know. But so far, people are liking what they're seeing for the most part. And really, I got to give a shout out to that person who pointed out the AI bingo card action. Not a lot of talk about that for Apple.They're going to see if the market responds to somebody else's folding phone, and then they're going to decide, OK, the market wants it.

MSFT,"UPDATE 3-Biden meets Microsoft, Google CEOs on AI dangers","(Changes paragraph 1; adds details on what Biden told companies in paragraphs 4-5; adds comments from OpenAI CEO paragraph 8)By Nandita Bose and David ShepardsonWASHINGTON, May 4 (Reuters) - President Joe Biden met with CEOs of top artificial intelligence companies including Microsoft and Alphabet's Google on Thursday and made clear they must ensure their products are safe before they are deployed.Generative artificial intelligence has become a buzzword this year, with apps such as ChatGPT capturing the public's fancy, sparking a rush among companies to launch similar products they believe will change the nature of work.Millions of users have begun testing such tools, which supporters say can make medical diagnoses, write screenplays, create legal briefs and debug software, leading to growing concern about how the technology could lead to privacy violations, skew employment decisions, and power scams and misinformation campaigns.Biden, who has used ChatGPT and experimented with it, told the officials they must mitigate current and potential risks AI poses to individuals, society and national security, the White House said.The meeting included a ""frank and constructive discussion"" on the need for companies to be more transparent with policymakers about their AI systems; the importance of evaluating the safety of such products; and the need to protect them from malicious attacks, the White House added.Thursday's two-hour meeting which began at 11:45 a.m. ET (1545 GMT), included Google's Sundar Pichai, Microsoft Corp's Satya Nadella, OpenAI's Sam Altman and Anthropic's Dario Amodei, along with Vice President Kamala Harris and administration officials including Biden's Chief of Staff Jeff Zients, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, Director of the National Economic Council Lael Brainard and Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo.Harris said in a statement the technology has the potential to improve lives but could pose safety, privacy and civil rights concerns. She told the chief executives they have a ""legal responsibility"" to ensure the safety of their artificial intelligence products and that the administration is open to advancing new regulations and supporting new legislation on artificial intelligence.In response to a question about whether companies are on the same page on regulations, Altman told reporters after the meeting ""we're surprisingly on the same page on what needs to happen.""The administration also announced a $140 million investment from the National Science Foundation to launch seven new AI research institutes and said the White House's Office of Management and Budget would release policy guidance on the use of AI by the federal government.Leading AI developers, including Anthropic, Google, Hugging Face, NVIDIA Corp, OpenAI, and Stability AI, will participate in a public evaluation of their AI systems.Shortly after Biden announced his reelection bid, the Republican National Committee produced a video featuring a dystopian future during a second Biden term, which was built entirely with AI imagery.Such political ads are expected to become more common as AI technology proliferates.United States regulators have fallen short of the tough approach European governments have taken on tech regulation and in crafting strong rules on deepfakes and misinformation.""We don't see this as a race,"" a senior administration official said, adding that the administration is working closely with the U.S.-EU Trade & Technology Council on the issue.In February, Biden signed an executive order directing federal agencies to eliminate bias in their AI use. The Biden administration has also released an AI Bill of Rights and a risk management framework. Last week, the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division also said they would use their legal authorities to fight AI-related harm.Tech giants have vowed many times to combat propaganda around elections, fake news about the COVID-19 vaccines, pornography and child exploitation, and hateful messaging targeting ethnic groups. But they have been unsuccessful, research and news events show.

""Probably the most complicated tech policy discussion possibly that we've ever had, and the administration wants to be very serious and thoughtful about it.""Anthropic, Google, Hugging Face, Microsoft, NVIDIA, OpenAI, and Stability AI will all participate in the new public evaluations at a hacking conference this summer called DEFCON 31.The meeting and announcements comes as the explosive growth of platforms like ChatGPT has tech leaders and Washington policymakers debating how heavy a hand Washington should have in the emerging technology in the years ahead. There are concerns AI could have widespread implications in the national security arena as well as in American society overall.“If you look at the history of technology, it’s a decade before you really see the transformative nature of it,” he said.Still, regulating AI is tricky, especially since tech regulation hasn’t been Washington’s strong suit.""We don't see this as a race, in fact we are working closely with our EU counterparts,"" said a senior Biden administration official during a preview of the meeting with reporters.The official underlined how AI poses risk across a wide array of areas from safety to civil rights to privacy to democracy to the economy, many of which will require worldwide solutions.The Commerce Department group - dubbed the National Artificial Intelligence Advisory Committee - is looking at national security as well as how AI could have social implication. That includes the introduction of bias as AI applications find their way into more and more corners of American life.""When social media and such was being developed, there was this mantra of move fast and break things,"" Raimondo said in an interview. ""We can't allow that to happen here."" AI has great potential, she added, ""however with those opportunities come substantial risk, risks that we may not even understand fully today.""The Senate leader says he is working on what he describes as “a new regulatory regime that would prevent potentially catastrophic damage to our country while simultaneously making sure the U.S. advances and leads in this transformative technology.”Also in attendance at Thursday's meeting will be a range of top White House officials from Chief of Staff Jeff Zients to National Security advisor Jake Sullivan to NEC Director Lael Brainard.The invitation notes that Biden officials will press the companies on safety, noting an “expectation that companies like yours must make sure their products are safe before making them available to the public.”This post has been updated with additional information.Ben Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.

MSFT,Exclusive-Microsoft offers to charge for Teams to address EU antitrust concerns,"(This May 4 story has been refiled to say that only Slack's complaint refers to Microsoft's Teams product, not other complaints, in paragraph 5)By Foo Yun CheeBRUSSELS (Reuters) - Microsoft has offered to charge different prices for its Office product with and without its Teams app to stave off a possible EU antitrust investigation and fine, two people familiar with the matter said.Microsoft has been seeking to address the EU competition enforcer's concerns since last year after Salesforce-owned workspace messaging app Slack complained to the European Commission, other people familiar with the matter told Reuters in December.Slack in 2020 alleged that Microsoft has unfairly integrated its workplace chat and video app Teams into its Office product. The U.S. tech giant introduced Teams in 2017 targeting the fast-growing and lucrative workplace collaboration market.The European Commission on Thursday said there were other complainants besides Slack.""We have received several complaints regarding Microsoft, including by Slack regarding Microsoft's conduct in relation to its Teams product. As you know the assessment is ongoing so we cannot comment further,"" a spokesperson said.Microsoft said it continued to engage cooperatively with the Commission and was ""open to pragmatic solutions that address its concerns and serve customers well"".Salesforce declined to comment.The EU antitrust watchdog is seeking feedback from Microsoft rivals on its proposal, the people said.In the last decade, the European Commission fined Microsoft 2.2 billion euros ($2.4 billion) for practices in breach of EU competition rules, including tying or bundling two or more products together.($1 = 0.9092 euros)(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee; Editing by Jan Harvey and Barbara Lewis)","May 4, 2023 at 10:01 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-offers-charge-teams-address-150102600.html,Reuters,0.1,0.0,0.01213768115942029,0.40688405797101446

MSFT,Apples Revenue Woes Put Market-Leading Rally at Risk,"(Bloomberg) -- After blowout results from Microsoft Corp. and Meta Platforms Inc. spurred huge rallies in their stocks, there are concerns the bar has been set too high for Apple Inc.Most Read from BloombergChina Takes the Yuan Global in Bid to Repel a Weaponized DollarZelenskiy Denies Ukraine Sent Drones to Hit Putin, KremlinTD, First Horizon End $13 Billion Merger as Regulators StallBank Drama Rages On; Apple Climbs in Late Trading: Markets WrapPacWest Is Weighing Strategic Options, Including Possible SaleNot only does the iPhone maker trade at an elevated valuation to peers after a market-leading 27% rally in the year to date, but it also comes with a weaker growth outlook. Second-quarter results due after Thursday’s close are expected to show a 4.8% drop in revenue and a 5.8% slide in earnings, according to consensus analyst estimates, paving the way for a first year of declining sales since 2019.“It isn’t as though the business is going downhill, but it is very highly valued, especially since we no longer have the perfect backdrop for tech,” said Daniel O’Keefe, who manages about $36 billion as a portfolio manager at Artisan Partners. “Apple has to grow a lot to generate good returns from here, and there’s no reason to think the growth it has seen over the past several years will continue at that pace.”Shares fell 1.5% on Thursday.Compared with the stellar results from the likes of Microsoft and Meta, Apple’s report is likely to make for more sobering reading. UBS Group AG analysts warned on Monday that US iPhone demand had “notably softened” in March, while Bloomberg Intelligence expects the smartphone market to drop 4% this year, with weakness concentrated in the first half of 2023. A disappointing forecast from Qualcomm Inc. on Wednesday underlined concerns about smartphone demand.Against that backdrop, analysts have been trimming their expectations. Consensus estimates have fallen for full-year revenue and earnings since Apple’s last report in February.Not that such concerns are evident in the stock’s valuation. Apple trades at 26 times estimated earnings, well above its 10-year average of 18 and at a premium to both the Nasdaq 100 and the S&P 500 tech index. In a sign of how Wall Street is muted on the stock’s outlook, the average analyst price target suggests a return potential of just 4.6% over the next 12 months, the lowest among the market’s trillion-dollar companies.“The risks are high, the stock is highly valued, if not overvalued, and the outlook doesn’t seem to be all that great,” said Robert Pavlik, senior portfolio manager at Dakota Wealth Management.Apple’s rally partly reflects how investors have turned to big tech amid turmoil in the banking sector, and JPMorgan Chase & Co. analyst Samik Chatterjee says the stock is likely to retain its safe-haven status, so long as its results don’t show a material deterioration in fundamentals.The gain also reflects optimism that the Federal Reserve could be nearing the end of its rate-hike cycle, easing what was a major headwind to tech multiples in last year’s selloff. On Wednesday, the Fed raised interest rates by a quarter percentage point but hinted this may be the final move of the cycle.“Large cap US stocks are pricing in a soft landing, and better-than-expected earnings do speak to the possibility of that outcome,” said Som Priestley, multi-asset solutions strategist at T. Rowe Price. “However, upside might be muted given where multiples are.”Tech Chart of the DayAnalysts are raising earnings per share estimates for the Nasdaq 100 Index after cutting their expectations through 2022 in a sign that confidence is starting to return. The increase in forecasts provides some backing for this year’s 19% rally in the tech-heavy gauge.Top Tech StoriesMicrosoft Corp. is getting rid of the waitlist to try its new OpenAI-based Bing search and chat, and adding features like the ability to request and post images in an effort to sustain its renewed momentum in the market.Qualcomm Inc., the largest maker of smartphone processors, tumbled in premarket trading after a disappointing forecast signaled that demand for mobile devices remains sluggish — especially in China.Sales of smartwatches, including Apple’s top selling version, have plateaued and are no longer a significant threat to the pricier end of the Swiss watch industry, according to Morgan Stanley.Silicon Valley has taken investment from moneyed state-run funds in the Middle East for years.

MSFT,Top ex-Google AI researchers raise funding from Thrive Capital -sources,"By Anna Tong and Krystal HuMay 4 (Reuters) - Two prominent former Google researchers who authored the groundbreaking paper that paved the way for the generative AI boom, have raised $8 million for their new startup Essential AI, four sources told Reuters.Thrive Capital had led the round in Essential AI, founded by Ashish Vaswani and Niki Parmar. The company is still in stealth mode and hasn't launched any product. Conviction and angel investor Elad Gil also participated in the round, one source close to the company added.Thrive Capital, founded by Joshua Kushner, is also an investor in Microsoft-backed OpenAI.Essential AI aims to build software for enterprises to use large language models, the core software of a new artificial intelligence system that has powered generative AI applications such as ChatGPT, sources said.Thrive Capital declined to comment. Vaswani and Parmar didn't respond to multiple requests for comment.The raise came after Vaswani and Parmar left Adept AI, a company they also co-founded in 2021 with former Google director David Luan. Adept, focused on training a neural network to perform general tasks for enterprise clients, has raised $415 million from investors including General Catalyst. EssentialAI is not in direct competition with Adept, sources added.Vaswani and Parmar are the first and third authors on Google's 2017 research paper ""Attention Is All You Need"", which introduced the ""transformer"" deep learning architecture that went on to become the basis for viral chatbot ChatGPT and the current race to develop products powered by generative AI.The duo join other authors on the famous paper who have left Google to start their own ventures and subsequently attracted millions in funding from venture investors, including Noam Shazeer, who is running AI chatbot startup Character.AI, and Aidan Gomez, who founded large language model startup Cohere.

Thanks for beating my numbers. Could you tell me a little bit, OpEx was pretty flat, do you expect it to be pretty flat for the rest of the year?Louis A. HochYes, it should be very flat.Jon Robert HickmanOkay. And could you give us a little guidance about gross margins?Louis A. HochWe'd like to be in the mid-20s.Jon Robert HickmanBy the end of the year?Louis A. HochBy the end of the year.Jon Robert HickmanOkay. So I'm a little bit confused about MoviePass. Is there -- do they have a deal with Walmart? Or was that just somebody jumping the gun? Was that a potential deal or a real deal?Houston Korth FrostMoviePass has not made any official announcement. So we'll just leave it at that. It's obviously MoviePass's business, and we'll wait for their official announcement.Jon Robert HickmanOkay. I take it as long as I'm talking to Mr. (inaudible), could you give us a little more guidance about, like, how you're making -- what the pipeline looks like for how you're making up for those onetime programs like the New York COVID vaccination program? Because if you did $10 million in, like, residual income, how do you make that up next year?Houston Korth FrostLouis A. HochAnd Jon, don't forget that residual spoilage income is part of our business model, and it's grown year-over-year every year for the last 5 years. So it's something we're focused on.Houston Korth FrostThe card issuing and prepaid business has really matured over the last few years. And it's a real business, and it continues to mature, like I said, every month with new implementations and partnerships.Jon Robert HickmanOkay. Louis, just one last question. So you've (inaudible) issue from last spring now. Is that true?Louis A. HochI'm sorry. You broke up again. Can you ask the question?Jon Robert HickmanIs it true that you've anniversaried the Voyager thing (inaudible) on the ACH side now that you're into the second quarter of 2023?Louis A. HochSo Voyager filed bankruptcy, I believe, January 1 of last year. And so they stopped processing about that same time. We did some residual stuff for them, but that was minor.Jon Robert HickmanSo on a year-over-year basis, that should be behind us, right?Louis A. HochAfter Q2.Jon Robert HickmanAfter Q2. Okay.OperatorThe next question comes from Gary Prestopino, of Barrington Research.Gary Frank PrestopinoCould you -- do you have what the total payment dollars processed were last year in Q2? I'm sorry, Q1. I'm sorry. I'm ahead of myself here. I'm just -- you say it was down to $1.23 billion this quarter, but what was it last year's Q1?Louis A. HochI don't know. I mean, we can pull that number and send it to you. The Q1 number of last year was obviously inflated by crypto processing. Crypto payments' average ticket is $500. So they were part of those dollars. But you've got to be careful when you're looking at dollars because our metrics, financial metrics can still do well if dollars go down but transactions go up. And that's what we saw last year. Overall dollars for the year were down, but transactions were up. And of course, we did really well growing the company.Gary Frank PrestopinoJust as a frame of reference there. And then I just wanted to get an idea when you're talking about ACH electronic check transactions were down, dollars processed were down, were you doing those kind of transactions for Voyager? I was under the assumption you were just doing ACH switch transactions for Voyager.Louis A. HochGary Frank PrestopinoGregory Mark CarterIt was 27%.Gary Frank PrestopinoFor PayFac. Okay. That's great. And then maybe could you elaborate a little bit on this new relationship with Microsoft? I'm unfamiliar with this. I really want to understand it because, obviously, the reach of Microsoft is very large. How does this work? And could this be something where you're just going to get a ton of processing volume once this thing starts ramping up?Gregory Mark CarterSo Suite Engine essentially facilitates a plug-in that now allows these enterprise accounts to utilize the Usio payments environment. So it is -- if you look at streamlining these implementations that we've talked about for the last several years, so those organizations that use Microsoft through the Dynamics environment, their speed to payment processing is substantially reduced by using that plug-in that Suite Engine facilitates.Louis A. HochAnd Microsoft Biz Central is like QuickBooks, except it's on steroids. It's used by bigger organizations. And so you can go to the plug-in library now and choose Usio as a payment option.Gregory Mark CarterAnd fortunately, we have a pipeline of accounts that are in queue as a result of that technology and relationship. So we're really excited about that.Gary Frank PrestopinoOkay. Maybe I'll talk to you about this offline. Because again, I've never heard of this. I don't understand it. I'm trying to understand it...Gregory Mark CarterSure. Happy to do so.Gary Frank Prestopino...what it can bring to you. It just seems large. And then lastly, Louis, you did say you expanded your engagement with L.A. County. Could you elaborate a little bit on that, please?Louis A. HochSo we've been printing notices for fees and fines. Had a lot of success with that. And they came back to us and said, ""Hey, we've got all these overpayments. So when somebody has a $100 parking fine and they send us $110, we've got to send them back the $10."" And they said, ""The only efficient way we can do that is via check."" And so we're printing a whole bunch of checks now for L.A. County.Gary Frank PrestopinoOkay. So it's just -- it's a nice shot of incremental business from what you're doing right now with L.A. County.Louis A. HochIt is, and it shows the trust that we've earned in a few months of doing business with them.Operator","May 4, 2023 at 6:32 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/q1-2023-usio-inc-earnings-113212454.html,Thomson Reuters StreetEvents,0.0,0.0,0.061737863030966476,0.4043690185931564

Grainger GWW and Lincoln Electric LECO.Growth at a reasonable price, or GARP, is an excellent strategy to earn quick investment profits. The GARP approach helps identify stocks priced below the market or any suitable target determined by a fundamental analysis.The strategy helps investors gain exposure to stocks with impressive prospects and trading at a discount. GARP stocks have solid prospects in terms of cash flow, revenues, earnings per share (EPS) and others.The GARP strategy offers ideal investment options by utilizing the best features of value and growth investing. Investors adopting the GARP approach will prefer stocks priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis. The stocks have solid prospects regarding cash flow, revenues, EPS and others.Growth MetricsA strong earnings growth history and impressive earnings prospects are the primary concepts that GARP investors borrow from the growth investing strategy. However, instead of super-normal growth rates, pursuing stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate is a tactic of GARP investors. Growth rates between 10% and 30% are considered ideal under the GARP strategy.Another growth metric considered by growth and GARP investors is the return on equity (ROE). GARP investors look for strong and higher ROE than the industry average to identify superior stocks. Moreover, stocks with a positive cash flow find precedence under the GARP plan.Value MetricsGARP investing prioritizes one of the popular value metrics — the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Though the investing style picks stocks with higher P/E ratios than value investors, it avoids companies with extremely high P/E ratios. The price-to-book value (P/B) ratio is also taken into consideration.Using the GARP principle, we have run a screen to identify stocks that should offer solid returns in the near term.Here are four of the five stocks that made it through the screen:Microsoft has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 3.25%, on average. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Microsoft’s fiscal 2023 earnings has moved 2.9% north to $9.61 per share in the past 60 days.Adobe has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 2.58% on average. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ADBE’s fiscal 2023 earnings has moved 1.2% north to $15.41 per share over the past 60 days.W.W.

MSFT,"White House to meet Microsoft, Google CEOs on AI dangers","By Nandita Bose and David ShepardsonWASHINGTON (Reuters) -President Joe Biden met with CEOs of top artificial intelligence companies including Microsoft and Alphabet's Google on Thursday and made clear they must ensure their products are safe before they are deployed.Generative artificial intelligence has become a buzzword this year, with apps such as ChatGPT capturing the public's fancy, sparking a rush among companies to launch similar products they believe will change the nature of work.Millions of users have begun testing such tools, which supporters say can make medical diagnoses, write screenplays, create legal briefs and debug software, leading to growing concern about how the technology could lead to privacy violations, skew employment decisions, and power scams and misinformation campaigns.Biden, who has used ChatGPT and experimented with it, told the officials they must mitigate current and potential risks AI poses to individuals, society and national security, the White House said.The meeting included a ""frank and constructive discussion"" on the need for companies to be more transparent with policymakers about their AI systems; the importance of evaluating the safety of such products; and the need to protect them from malicious attacks, the White House added.Thursday's two-hour meeting which began at 11:45 a.m. ET (1545 GMT), included Google's Sundar Pichai, Microsoft Corp's Satya Nadella, OpenAI's Sam Altman and Anthropic's Dario Amodei, along with Vice President Kamala Harris and administration officials including Biden's Chief of Staff Jeff Zients, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, Director of the National Economic Council Lael Brainard and Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo.Harris said in a statement the technology has the potential to improve lives but could pose safety, privacy and civil rights concerns. She told the chief executives they have a ""legal responsibility"" to ensure the safety of their artificial intelligence products and that the administration is open to advancing new regulations and supporting new legislation on artificial intelligence.In response to a question about whether companies are on the same page on regulations, Altman told reporters after the meeting ""we're surprisingly on the same page on what needs to happen.""The administration also announced a $140 million investment from the National Science Foundation to launch seven new AI research institutes and said the White House's Office of Management and Budget would release policy guidance on the use of AI by the federal government.

MSFT,"White House to meet Microsoft, Google CEOs on AI dangers","By Nandita BoseWASHINGTON, May 4 (Reuters) - The White House will host CEOs of top artificial intelligence companies, including Alphabet Inc's Google and Microsoft, on Thursday to discuss risks and safeguards as the technology catches the attention of governments and lawmakers globally.Generative artificial intelligence has become a buzzword this year, with apps such as ChatGPT capturing the public's fancy, sparking a rush among companies to launch similar products they believe will change the nature of work.Millions of users have begun testing such tools, which supporters say can make medical diagnoses, write screenplays, create legal briefs and debug software, leading to growing concern about how the technology could lead to privacy violations, skew employment decisions, and power scams and misinformation campaigns.""We aim to have a frank discussion about the risks we see in current and near-term AI development,"" said a senior administration official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter. ""Our North Star here is this idea that if we're going to seize these benefits, we have to start by managing the risks.""Thursday's meeting, will include Google's Sundar Pichai, Microsoft's Satya Nadella, OpenAI's Sam Altman and Anthropic's Dario Amodei along with Vice President Kamala Harris and administration officials including Biden's Chief of Staff Jeff Zients, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, Director of the National Economic Council Lael Brainard and Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo.Ahead of the meeting, the administration announced a $140 million investment from the National Science Foundation to launch seven new AI research institutes and said the White House's Office of Management and Budget would release policy guidance on the use of AI by the federal government.Leading AI developers, including Anthropic, Google, Hugging Face, NVIDIA, OpenAI, and Stability AI, will participate in a public evaluation of their AI systems at the AI Village at DEFCON 31 - one of the largest hacker conventions in the world - and run on a platform created by Scale AI and Microsoft.Shortly after Biden announced his reelection bid, Republican National Committee produced a video featuring a dystopian future during a second Biden term, that was built entirely with AI imagery.Such political ads are expected to become more common as AI technology proliferates.United States regulators have fallen short of the tough approach European governments have taken on tech regulation and in crafting strong rules on deep fakes and misinformation that companies must follow or risk hefty fines.""We don't see this as a race,"" the administration official said, adding that the administration is working closely with the US-EU Trade & Technology Council on the issue.In February, Biden signed an executive order directing federal agencies to eliminate bias in their use of AI.

MSFT,You can now sign up for Microsoft's Bing without a waitlist,"In a press announcement early Thursday, Microsoft CVP Yusuf Mehdi announced that Bing, which is powered by OpenAI’s GPT-4 technology, is now available to the general public as an open preview. In other words, you can now use Bing without first having to sign up for a waitlist as long as you have a Microsoft account.More important than making Bing available to the general public, though, is word that Microsoft is making it so third-party developers can build their own app plug-ins into the software.“For example, if you’re researching the latest restaurant for dinner in Bing chat, it will leverage OpenTable to help you find and book a reservation,” Mehdi explained in a statement. “Or, with Wolfram|Alpha, you can create powerful visualizations and get answers to complex science, math, and human-curated data-based questions directly from Bing chat.”The idea is to make Bing chat a kind of one-stop shop for search, allowing consumers to both ask questions and receive answers via text and images.Mehdi says Bing is also expanding its existing Bing Image Creator, which is a part of Bing chat, to 100 more languages, opening up the app to far more users than before.In the future, he says, you’ll also be able to upload images to Bing chat and search for similar content.In terms of basic capabilities, Bing is also adding the ability to go back to your chat history and pick up where you left off during a previous session. You’ll also be able to export and share your chats to other apps. Microsoft, though, didn’t say which apps outside of Microsoft Word.According to Mehdi, Bing users have already taken part in 500 million chats with the bot in the 90 days since it went live. The app now has 100 million users and mobile app downloads have increased 4x.But Microsoft isn’t looking to dethrone the search giant just yet. When discussing the potential for search, the company speaks in terms of market share percentages. When the company debuted Bing in February, Microsoft representatives said that every one percent of market share Bing can take from Google is worth $2 billion in revenue.With Microsoft continuing to innovate on Bing, and Google’s Bard still in a limited preview, the Windows maker could be backing its rival into a corner.Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance","May 4, 2023 at 2:00 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/you-can-now-sign-up-for-microsofts-bing-without-a-waitlist-070003038.html,Yahoo Finance,0.0,0.0,0.16534021534021534,0.4737484737484738
MSFT,How to sign up for Bing while it's still in test mode,"Read moreA look back at BTS as it became the world's top-selling actYour anxiety brings 4 distinct superpowersAmericans may have seen the last of big rent hikesThe tool has been incredibly popular since its launch: Microsoft said that Bing has more than 100,000 daily active users, and daily installs of the mobile app have increased four times since the new Bing’s launch. Until now, though, a limited number of people had been allowed to sign up for the new version.Now, Microsoft will allow users to access Bing while it remains in test mode—which is a helpful reminder of how generative AI tools are still in the very early stages.Here are some other changes users will see with the updated Bing:Answers will be more visual, with an emphasis on charts, graphs, and photos. When you search “How to ski,” for instance, you might receive a response that includes both text on how to ski and a related video pulled from YouTube.Users have been able to generate both written and visual content with a prompt from within the chat interface. But now, users can generate an image in more than 100 languages in Bing.Microsoft is also working on incorporating visual search in chat, through which users will be able to upload images and search the web for related content.Users can now save their chat history.Users can also export their chats.For instance, an OpenTable plug-in will mean that Bing users who are searching in the chat about making a reservation at a specific restaurant will be able to view openings and be provided with an OpenTable link to complete the reservation.More from QuartzThe world’s biggest banknote printer said the demand for cash hit a two-decade lowEvery fifth car sold worldwide this year will be electricClick here to read the full article.","May 4, 2023 at 2:00 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sign-bing-while-still-test-070000825.html,Quartz,0.0,0.0,0.1468023345701917,0.3471826685219543

MSFT,"Microsofts chief economist is convinced that A.I. will be used by bad actorsbut says that cars can be dangerous, too","Microsoft’s chief economist offers the following reply to those concerned about A.I. being misused for crime or other nefarious purposes: Cars can be unsafe, too. The key is putting safeguards in place.Vehicles, for example, get people to where they want to go. But they’re also a danger because of accidents and pollution.“I hope that A.I. will never, ever become as deadly as [an] internal combustion engine is,” Schwarz said.A.I.’s dangers can be hard to dismiss even for companies working on them, and Schwarz acknowledges that the technology can cause harm in the wrong hands.“I am quite confident that A.I. will be used by bad actors, and yes it will cause real damage,” Schwarz said. “It can do a lot of damage in the hands of spammers, people who want to manipulate elections and so on.”But some of that can be avoided, he said. “Once we see real harm, we have to ask ourselves the simple question: ‘Can we regulate that in a way where the good things that will be prevented by this regulation are less important?’” Schwarz said. “The principles should be the benefits from the regulation to our society should be greater than the cost to our society.”Microsoft is focused on the good that A.I. can bring society and is working to develop A.I. to “help people achieve more” by making them more efficient, Schwarz said.“I console myself with the normal excuse: If I hadn’t done it, somebody else would have.”One of Hinton’s concerns is the availability of A.I. tools that can create images and aggregate information in a matter of seconds. They could lead to the spread of fake content whose accuracy the average person would have trouble discerning.While Schwarz and Hinton worry about how bad actors may misuse A.I., the two experts diverge in how they think A.I. may impact certain jobs.“It takes away the drudge work,” Hinton said. “It might take away more than that.”Executives at tech giants like Google and Microsoft have said that a six-month pause will not solve the problem. Among them is Alphabet and Google CEO Sundar Pichai.“To me, I would prefer to see more knowledge, and even an acceleration of research and development, rather than a pause for six months, which I am not sure if it would even be feasible,” said Microsoft’s Eric Horvitz. “In a larger sense, six months doesn’t really mean very much for a pause. We need to really just invest more in understanding and guiding and even regulating this technology—jump in, as opposed to pause.”","May 3, 2023 at 2:09 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-chief-economist-convinced-used-190905680.html,Fortune,-0.6499999999999999,0.7833333333333333,0.07877801120448179,0.49161647992530344

The same feature will be coming to Microsoft Teams.On its own, Microsoft’s move to shove Edge down the throats of Outlook and Teams users is annoying, but perhaps defensible if you consider that it enables a new “side-by-side experience” that lets users see the emails or chats that contained the opened link in an Edge sidebar.

MSFT,Apples earnings could buoy or sink Big Techs earnings season,"Wednesday, May 3, 2023“None of what's already been reported matters come Thursday night,” explained Deepwater Asset Management Managing Partner Gene Munster.“And the reason is ... because [of] the size of Apple, and also it's been relatively stable too. It's done a better job of enduring this versus other tech, so if there is a problem, you can throw out all the good news from Microsoft and Google and Meta,” Munster added.In turn, a solid result from Apple could help buoy the industry and drive up shares of other Big Tech names. But a miss could mean increased pressure on rival tech stocks, just as the sector looks to finally move past its COVID-induced hangover.Analysts expect Apple to report revenue of $92.6 billion for the second quarter, a 4.8% decline from the $97.3 billion Apple brought in during the same quarter last year. That's about in line with the 5% decline Apple posted in Q1.“We believe the broader tech industry is all on pins and needles waiting for Apple's results as many of the tech haters continue to yell fire in a crowded theater around softening demand, with Apple the best barometer globally of this metric,” Wedbush Managing Director Dan Ives told Yahoo Finance via email.For investors tracking the S&P 500, a miss by Apple could have an outsized impact on their portfolios.While Apple’s enormous size and weight relative to market competitors gives its results added importance, the company’s performance is also a key indicator for consumer spending.“Most, if not all, iPhones are purchased for consumers. Macs, for the most part, are purchased for consumers and/or small, medium businesses,” explained UBS Managing Director David Vogt. “So it's really more of a bellwether or a barometer regarding high end consumer spending.”A miss on Apple’s revenue, especially for its iPhone business, would mean consumers are spending less and holding back on making large purchases. Worse still would be any signal that revenue will come in weaker than anticipated in Q3. That would signal that Apple anticipates customers will continue to hold back on spending their cash.It all comes down to Thursday night.

MSFT,"Artificial intelligence will do real damage, warns Microsoft chief","Artificial intelligence (AI) will “cause real damage” when it gets into the hands of “bad actors”, a Microsoft boss has warned.Michael Schwarz, the US tech company’s chief economist, told the World Economic Forum (WEF): “I am confident AI will be used by bad actors, and yes it will cause real damage.”“It can do a lot of damage in the hands of spammers with elections and so on,” he said in comments reported by Bloomberg.Mr Hinton said in a newspaper interview: “It is hard to see how you can prevent the bad actors from using it for bad things.”The meeting has been called so officials can hold a “frank discussion” with tech company leaders about the risks of upcoming AI technology.Scientists from Microsoft and OpenAI claimed in March that they had seen “sparks” of human-level intelligence from the latter’s latest creation during laboratory tests.This so-called artificial general intelligence could foreshadow the creation of autonomous robots capable of making their own decisions completely independently from human input.OpenAI’s November release of ChatGPT took the world by storm as the AI chatbot surpassed all previous expectations of the technology.Its unique selling point is that it is trained on petabytes of data from across the entire internet, meaning users can ask it questions on virtually any topic and receive convincing-sounding answers.“This kind of AI we're talking about right now can sometimes lead to something we call hallucination,” Prabhakar Raghavan, the head of Google Search, told a German newspaper in February.Bard gave an inaccurate answer to the question: “What new discoveries from the James Webb Space Telescope can I tell my 9 year old about?”It falsely suggested the telescope was used to make the very first discoveries of planets outside the solar system.The response triggered the biggest single-day fall in Google’s share price for five months.Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

MSFT,Tough Time Ahead for Cloud Computing ETFs?,"Cloud computing has been a booming market in recent years as more and more businesses move their workloads to the cloud. However, with economic uncertainty on the horizon, companies are looking for ways to trim costs. This has led to slower revenue growth for cloud divisions at major companies such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Google. As a result, cloud computing segment may be facing a tough time ahead as cloud providers are feeling the pinch, as quoted on a CNBC article.In 2022, fears of a recession began to hit the economy, causing a deceleration in the third and fourth quarters for Amazon Web Services (AWS) and a slowdown in December for Microsoft. Last quarter, Microsoft finance chief Amy Hood spooked analysts with comments about the expected continuation of this slowdown.Amazon finance chief Brian Olsavsky recently reported that in April, AWS revenue growth had slumped by about five percentage points from the first-quarter growth rate of almost 16%. Similarly, at Google, cloud growth slowed to 28% from a year earlier in the first quarter from 32% in the prior period, despite reaching profitability for the first time on record. Ruth Porat, Alphabet’s finance chief, noted that slower consumption growth was due to customers looking to optimize their costs.As a result of this deceleration in growth, cloud computing ETFs could be facing a challenging time. Investors may be hesitant to invest in these ETFs as the growth outlook for the industry appears to be slowing down. The recent slide in Amazon’s stock price is an indication that investors are not confident in the future growth prospects of cloud computing.Despite the current challenges facing cloud providers, they remain optimistic about the long-term prospects of the industry. According to Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, only 90% of global IT spend is still on-premises, indicating that there is still a lot of room for growth in the cloud computing industry. Microsoft’s Amy Hood also noted that the financial comparisons will soon be against numbers from the point last year when the market was softening, which could lead to a more positive outlook.In the first quarter of 2023, although there was a lower year-on-year growth rate of 20% compared to the previous year, there were some encouraging developments such as the global revenue figure of $63 billion, which was an increase of over $10 billion from Q1 2022.Cloud computing ETFs may face a challenging time in the near future as cloud providers experience a deceleration in growth due to businesses looking to trim costs. However, with optimism for the future growth prospects of the industry, investors should remain cautious but not dismissive. The cloud computing market still has significant potential for growth, and a long-term view may be necessary for investors looking to benefit from the sector.WisdomTree Cloud Computing ETF (WCLD): ETF Research ReportsDirexion Daily Cloud Computing Bull 2X Shares (CLDL): ETF Research ReportsFidelity Cloud Computing ETF (FCLD): ETF Research ReportsTo read this article on Zacks.com click here.Zacks Investment Research","May 3, 2023 at 5:00 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tough-time-ahead-cloud-computing-100010122.html,Zacks,-0.3888888888888889,0.8333333333333334,0.06752701432933991,0.3918839558374442

MSFT,"UPDATE 2-Google, Microsoft CEOs called to AI meeting at White House","(Adds Biden's position on AI in paragraph 4)By Nandita Bose and David ShepardsonWASHINGTON, May 2 (Reuters) - The chief executives of Alphabet Inc's Google, Microsoft, OpenAI and Anthropic will meet with Vice President Kamala Harris and top administration officials to discuss key artificial intelligence (AI) issues on Thursday, said a White House official.The invitation seen by Reuters to the CEOs noted President Joe Biden's ""expectation that companies like yours must make sure their products are safe before making them available to the public.""Concerns about fast-growing AI technology include privacy violations, bias and worries it could proliferate scams and misinformation.In April, Biden said it remains to be seen whether AI is dangerous but underscored that technology companies had a responsibility to ensure their products were safe. Social media had already illustrated the harm that powerful technologies can do without the right safeguards, he said.The administration has also been seeking public comments on proposed accountability measures for AI systems, as concerns grow about its impact on national security and education.On Monday, deputies from the White House Domestic Policy Council and White House Office of Science and Technology Policy wrote in a blog post about how the technology can pose a serious risk to workers.The Thursday meeting will be attended by Biden's Chief of Staff Jeff Zients, Deputy Chief of Staff Bruce Reed, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, Director of the National Economic Council Lael Brainard and Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo among others, said the White House official who did not wish to be named.The companies did not immediately respond to a request for comment.ChatGPT, an AI program that recently grabbed the public's attention for its ability to write answers quickly to a wide range of queries, in particular has attracted U.S. lawmakers' attention as it has grown to be the fastest-growing consumer application in history with more than 100 million monthly active users.""I think we should be cautious with AI, and I think there should be some government oversight because it is a danger to the public,"" Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk said last month in a television interview.

NVDA,Weekly Stock List,"Innovation may be hard to define but, to borrow from former U.S. Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart, you know it when you see it. The United States economy is full of innovation. It has to be. Manufacturing industries that dominated the economy decades ago - textiles, televisions, even automobiles, to a large degree - have moved overseas, where costs are lower. Yet the U.S. economy is at its largest point in history and still growing. If U.S. corporations weren't innovating, creating new products and services, and moving into new markets and applications, the domestic economy would be contracting, not expanding, and capital would not be flooding into the country. Particularly at this juncture of the market and economic cycles, when uncertainty is high due to high inflation and rising interest rates, we look to innovative companies to successfully navigate the challenges. At Argus, an 88-year-old independent research firm that has innovated a time or two in its long history, we have focused on four types of innovative companies: Industry Disruptors; First to Market; New Product Specialists; and Product & Process Perfectors. Here are some examples of companies, featured in our Innovation Theme Model Portfolio.","May 8, 2023 at 9:17 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/m/9946d764-2d7e-382a-9319-356b40cc3e4f/weekly-stock-list.html,Argus Research,0.0,0.0,0.14966883116883117,0.45902705627705637
NVDA,NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,"Shares of this maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence have returned +6.1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.2% change. The Zacks Semiconductor - General industry, to which Nvidia belongs, has gained 2.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Nvidia is expected to post earnings of $0.92 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -32.4%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.1%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.50 points to a change of +34.7% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.6%.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.98 indicates a change of +32.9% from what Nvidia is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.4%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Nvidia is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Nvidia, the consensus sales estimate of $6.5 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -21.6%. The $29.68 billion and $37.11 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +10% and +25%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryNvidia reported revenues of $6.05 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -20.8%. EPS of $0.88 for the same period compares with $1.32 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.01 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.61%. The EPS surprise was +8.64%.Over the last four quarters, Nvidia surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Nvidia is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Nvidia. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) : Free Stock Analysis ReportTo read this article on Zacks.com click here.Zacks Investment Research","May 8, 2023 at 8:00 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-corporation-nvda-attracting-investor-130001102.html,Zacks,0.0,0.0,0.09114285714285714,0.45901587301587277

NVDA,Here's How Much a $1000 Investment in Nvidia Made 10 Years Ago Would Be Worth Today,"How much a stock's price changes over time is important for most investors, since price performance can both impact your investment portfolio and help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.FOMO, or the fear of missing out, also plays a role in investing, particularly with tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.What if you'd invested in Nvidia (NVDA) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to NVDA for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?Nvidia's Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at Nvidia's main business drivers.Bottom LinePutting together a successful investment portfolio takes a combination of research, patience, and a little bit of risk. For Nvidia, if you bought shares a decade ago, you're likely feeling really good about your investment today.According to our calculations, a $1000 investment made in May 2013 would be worth $82,710.89, or an 8,171.09% gain, as of May 8, 2023. Investors should keep in mind that this return excludes dividends but includes price appreciation.The S&P 500 rose 156.21% and the price of gold increased 31.59% over the same time frame in comparison.Analysts are anticipating more upside for NVDA.NVIDIA is gaining from strong growth of artificial intelligence, high-performance computing and accelerated computing, which is boosting its Compute & Networking revenues. A surge in Hyperscale demand and a solid uptake of artificial intelligence-based smart cockpit infotainment solutions are acting as tailwinds. Collaboration with Mercedes-Benz and Audi is likely to advance its presence in autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space. We expect its Automotive segment’s revenue to grow at a CAGR of 29% through fiscal 2023-2025. However, NVDA’s near-term prospects look gloomy due to weakening demand for chips used in gaming and data center end markets. While macroeconomic headwinds are impacting gaming and data center chip demand, higher channel inventory levels are hurting chip prices.Shares have gained 6.08% over the past four weeks and there have been 3 higher earnings estimate revisions for fiscal 2023 compared to none lower. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) : Free Stock Analysis ReportTo read this article on Zacks.com click here.Zacks Investment Research","May 8, 2023 at 7:30 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-much-1000-investment-nvidia-123012392.html,Zacks,0.25,0.15000000000000002,0.15647959183673477,0.49574829931972775
NVDA,Institutional investors have a lot riding on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) with 66% ownership,"Significantly high institutional ownership implies NVIDIA's stock price is sensitive to their trading actionsThe top 25 shareholders own 45% of the company Insiders have sold recently And things are looking up for institutional investors after the company gained US$23b in market cap last week. One-year return to shareholders is currently 54% and last week’s gain was the icing on the cake.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of NVIDIA. View our latest analysis for NVIDIA Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.NVIDIA already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see NVIDIA's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.Investors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in NVIDIA. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 8.3% of shares outstanding. With 7.3% and 5.3% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and FMR LLC are the second and third largest shareholders. Additionally, the company's CEO Jen-Hsun Huang directly holds 3.5% of the total shares outstanding.A deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.With a 30% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over NVIDIA. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated. This may not be consistent with full year annual report figures.","May 7, 2023 at 9:00 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/institutional-investors-lot-riding-nvidia-140014996.html,Simply Wall St.,0.0,0.0,0.1369272844272844,0.4490283140283141

The Nasdaq Composite advanced but just slightly, less than 0.1%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 lost 1.2% and 0.8%, respectively.The week’s trade was dominated by the anticipation and aftermath of the Fed’s rate hike.  Markets had already priced in a 25 bps rate hike, and the decision did not come as a surprise. Yet, the regional banking crisis deepened throughout the week, raising hopes that the central bank might take a more pragmatic view of the situation. However, with signals coming in from the Fed that a rate pause was not a certainty even in the coming months, the first four sessions of the week reeled under the resultant gloom and doom.But a blockbuster Friday marked a rebound for the indexes, and much of last week’s losses were pared off.

NVDA,AMDs AI Progress Wins Over Traders Seeking More Than Just Promises,"(Bloomberg) -- Promises of a future when artificial intelligence drives a surge in sales for chipmakers are no longer cutting it in the stock market. These days, hard evidence of progress toward that is needed.Most Read from BloombergPeter Thiel Says Moving to Florida from Silicon Valley Is Too ExpensiveHeavy Marijuana Use Increases Schizophrenia in Men, Study FindsSEC Investigates Trades by First Republic Executives Before Sale to JPMorganBruised Banks Fuel Short-Covering Rally in Stocks: Markets WrapBMW Warns Owners ‘Do Not Drive’ 90,000 Cars Recalled Over Defective AirbagTake the case of Advanced Micro Devices Inc. The stock jumped 6.1% on Thursday on news it’s working with Microsoft Corp. on technology for AI workloads to rival those from Nvidia Corp. That almost erased losses suffered a day earlier after a weak revenue forecast overshadowed assurances from Chief Executive Officer Lisa Su that AMD is well positioned to capitalize on growth in AI computing.Chip-related stocks have emerged this year as a popular way for investors to gain exposure to AI after the adoption of OpenAI’s ChatGPT created a trader frenzy. The biggest beneficiary so far has been Nvidia, whose shares are up 90% this year in a reflection of its market dominance. As its only real rival in the type of graphics chips that data center owners are increasingly turning to, AMD has gained 32%.“AI deserves all the hype it gets and more,” said Olivier Sarfati, head of equities at GenTrust. “Money is going to be made in processors, cloud services, data center, to say nothing of industries in general.”Still, just talking about a company’s capabilities for AI computing isn’t getting the rosy reception from investors it once did. In the absence of new developments, market watchers are turning their gaze to a more immediate issue — weak demand for personal computers and smartphones.The work with Microsoft doesn’t change much right now for AMD fundamentally, according to Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon, and on Friday AMD shares slipped back 1.8%. Instead, it offers “a narrative boost as they try to shift the story toward AI,” he wrote in a note.To that end, AMD’s Su dedicated a large chunk of this week’s earnings call to AI. The area is the company’s “number one strategic priority,” she told analysts, highlighted by the more than 50 mentions of the term ‘AI’ on the call.Underlining the trend, Qualcomm Inc. CEO Cristiano Amon also talked up his company’s AI bona fides on the chipmaker’s earnings call on Wednesday. Yet that wasn’t enough to stop the stock from falling more than 5% the following day after a quarterly revenue forecast that trailed estimates.Chegg’s 50% Wipeout Shows Shock of AI Colliding With US BusinessThe true test of whether investors are now turning a deaf ear to promises of future AI business will come later this month when Nvidia reports. The surge in its shares has added $330 billion in market capitalization and made the company the sixth most-valuable in the S&P 500.Even more remarkable is that the rally has come amid falling sales. Nvidia’s revenue has been hurt by the slump in personal computers and is expected to have dropped 22% in the first quarter, according to the average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.Three months ago when Nvidia last reported earnings the term ‘AI’ was used more than 80 times on its conference call with analysts. While CEO Jensen Huang has earned the right to talk about the subject more than anyone else, there’ll be more pressure than ever to keep proving it’s translating into real earnings growth.Tech Chart of the DayThe Nasdaq 100 Index is coming off a four-day drop, the longest such streak for the tech-heavy index since a five-day decline that ended in December. While the streak is the longest of the year, the scale is relatively muted; the gauge only declined 2% during the current slump. The index remains up about 19% this year, and recently closed at its highest since August. The index rose 0.9% on Friday.Top Tech StoriesSales of Apple Inc.’s iPhone rebounded last quarter, helping the world’s most valuable company top earnings estimates and weather an industrywide downturn that has battered much of its product lineup.Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook expressed cautious optimism about the flood of new artificial intelligence services, saying that while the technology has huge potential, there also are “a number of issues that need to be sorted.”Cook singled out India as pivotal for the iPhone maker, underscoring how the world’s most populous country is on the cusp of becoming both a major market and production base.A senior software engineer at Google wrote a critique asserting that the internet search leader is losing its edge in artificial intelligence to the open-source community, where many independent researchers use AI technology to make rapid and unexpected advances.Tesla Inc. raised the prices of its premium models in China, following a small increase in the cost of its top-selling Model 3 and Model Y earlier in the week.Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.’s international online shopping unit is exploring a US initial public offering as it weighs options to spur growth for the business that includes major e-commerce brands Lazada and AliExpress.--With assistance from Ryan Vlastelica and Subrat Patnaik.(Updates to market open.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekAirbus Bets on a Stretched A220 Jet to Beat Boeing’s 737How a Dishwasher Engineer Challenged Elon Musk’s Grip on Commercial SpaceEven $500 Million a Year From Google Isn’t Enough to Save FirefoxData Science Is the Hot New Master’s at B-SchoolsToo Big to Fail, But Not Too Big to Bail Out Other Banks©2023 Bloomberg L.P.","May 5, 2023 at 8:40 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amd-ai-progress-wins-over-134007274.html,Bloomberg,0.4,0.35,0.09607195013821519,0.44283497626871116
NVDA,10 Best International Index Funds To Buy,"While shares of the duo are traded on American exchanges, a variety of other important firms, particularly those in the world's second largest economy China, are not. This makes for an important argument for investing in foreign markets, supplemented by the fact that economic downturns in America might not be replicated in other countries - and investing in foreign stocks could prove to be an effective way to protect one's portfolio (or even grow it) during an economic downturn.For some time, the forecast for the U.S. economy prepared by the staff had featured subdued real GDP growth for this year and some softening in the labor market. Given their assessment of the potential economic effects of the recent banking-sector developments, the staff’s projection at the time of the March meeting included a mild recession starting later this year, with a recovery over the subsequent two years. Real GDP growth in 2024 was projected to remain below the staff’s estimate of potential output growth, and then GDP growth in 2025 was expected to be above that of potential. Resource utilization in both product and labor markets was forecast to be much less tight than in the January projection. The level of real output was projected to move below the staff’s estimate of potential output in early 2024, more than a year sooner than in the previous projection. Likewise, the unemployment rate was projected to rise above the staff’s estimate of its natural rate early next year.So, if there's a recession in the U.S., where the rates have been raised higher than in other regions, then foreign investing makes more sense. At the same time, another key reason many institutional investors invest abroad is that emerging markets often give higher returns than developed markets. Of course, most of these investments are in bonds with fixed interest rates, but the business potential in emerging markets can contribute to firms operating in those areas seeing big gains in their share price.. . . The Fed wasn't really going, in May I point that Jerome Powell said . . we aren't even considering 75 basis point hikes. Then in June they rose rates, overnight lending rates, by 75 basis points, the next meeting 75 basis points, the next meeting 75 basis points, the next meeting 75 basis points. He said that in May. Market fell to October. They're still raising rates. Where are we now in the market? Where we were in May!

NVDA,Meta Platforms scoops up AI networking chip team from Graphcore,"By Katie PaulMay 5 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms Inc has hired an Oslo-based team that until late last year was building artificial-intelligence networking technology at British chip unicorn Graphcore.A Meta spokesperson confirmed the hirings in response to a request for comment, after Reuters identified 10 people whose LinkedIn profiles said they worked at Graphcore until December 2022 or January 2023 and subsequently joined Meta in February or March of this year.""We recently welcomed a number of highly-specialized engineers in Oslo to our infrastructure team at Meta. They bring deep expertise in the design and development of supercomputing systems to support AI and machine learning at scale in Meta's data centers,"" said Jon Carvill, the Meta spokesperson.The move brings additional muscle to the social media giant's bid to improve how its data centers handle AI work, as it races to cope with demand for AI-oriented infrastructure from teams across the company looking to build new features.Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, has become increasingly reliant on AI technology to target advertising, select posts for its apps' feeds and purge banned content from its platforms.On top of that, it is now rushing to join competitors like Microsoft Corp and Alphabet Inc's Google in releasing generative AI products capable of creating human-like writing, art and other content, which investors see as the next big growth area for tech companies.The 10 employees' job descriptions on LinkedIn indicated the team had worked on AI-specific networking technology at Graphcore, which develops computer chips and systems optimized for AI work.Carvill declined to say what they would be working on at Meta.Graphcore closed its Oslo office as part of a broader restructuring announced in October last year, a spokesperson for the startup said, as it struggled to make inroads against U.S.-based firms like Nvidia Corp and Advanced Micro Devices Inc which dominate the market for AI chips.Meta already has an in-house unit designing several kinds of chips aimed at speeding up and maximizing efficiency for its AI work, including a network chip that performs a sort of air traffic control function for servers, two sources told Reuters.Efficient networking is especially useful for modern AI systems like those behind chatbot ChatGPT or image-generation tool Dall-E, which are far too large to fit onto a single computing chip and must instead be split up over many chips strung together.A new category of network chip has emerged to help keep data moving smoothly within those computing clusters. Nvidia, AMD and Intel Corp all make such network chips.In addition to its network chip, Meta is also designing a complex computing chip to both train AI models and perform inference, a process in which the trained models make judgments and generate responses to prompts, although it does not expect that chip to be ready until around 2025.Graphcore, one of the UK's most valuable tech startups, once was seen by investors like Microsoft and venture capital firm Sequoia as a promising potential challenger to Nvidia's commanding lead in the market for AI chip systems.However, it faced a setback in 2020 when Microsoft scrapped an early deal to buy Graphcore's chips for its Azure cloud computing platform, according to a report by UK newspaper The Times. Microsoft instead used Nvidia's GPUs to build the massive infrastructure powering ChatGPT developer OpenAI, which Microsoft also backs.Sequoia has since written down its investment in Graphcore to zero, although it remains on the company's board, according to a source familiar with the relationship. The write-down was first reported by Insider in October.The Graphcore spokesperson confirmed the setbacks, but said the company was ""perfectly positioned"" to take advantage of accelerating commercial adoption of AI.Graphcore was last valued at $2.8 billion after raising $222 million in its most recent investment round in 2020.

NVDA,Microsoft Working With AMD on Expansion Into AI Processors,"(Bloomberg) -- Microsoft Corp. is working with Advanced Micro Devices Inc. on the chipmaker’s expansion into artificial intelligence processors, according to people with knowledge of the situation, part of a multipronged strategy to secure more of the highly coveted components.Most Read from BloombergPeter Thiel Says Moving to Florida from Silicon Valley Is Too ExpensiveApple Shares Rise After iPhone Bounces Back, Sales Top EstimatesJPMorgan Sees Investors Moving to Gold, Tech Amid Recession RiskChina Takes the Yuan Global in Bid to Repel a Weaponized DollarHeavy Marijuana Use Increases Schizophrenia in Men, Study FindsThe companies are teaming up to offer an alternative to Nvidia Corp., which dominates the market for AI-capable chips called graphics processing units, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the matter is private. The software giant is providing support to bolster AMD’s efforts, including engineering resources, and working with the chipmaker on a homegrown Microsoft processor for AI workloads, code-named Athena, the people said.Frank Shaw, a Microsoft spokesman, denied that AMD is part of Athena. “AMD is a great partner,” he said. “However, they are not involved in Athena.”AMD shares jumped more than 6.5% on Thursday, and Microsoft gained about 1%. AMD representatives declined to comment. Nvidia stock declined 1.9%.The arrangement is part of a broader rush to augment AI processing power, which is in great demand after the explosion of chatbots like ChatGPT and other services based on the technology. Microsoft is both a top provider of cloud-computing services and a driving force of AI use. The company has pumped $10 billion into ChatGPT maker OpenAI, and has vowed to add such features to its entire software lineup.Read More: Microsoft to Bring OpenAI’s Chatbot Technology to Office AppsThe move also reflects Microsoft’s deepening involvement in the chip industry. The company has been building up a silicon division over the past several years under former Intel Corp. executive Rani Borkar, and the group now has a staff of almost 1,000 employees. The Information last month reported on Microsoft’s development of the Athena artificial-intelligence chip.Several hundred of those employees are working on the Athena project, and Microsoft has spent about $2 billion on its chip efforts, according to one of the people. But the undertaking doesn’t portend a split with Nvidia. Microsoft intends to keep working closely with that company, whose chips are the workhorses for training and running AI systems. It’s also trying to find ways to get more Nvidia’s processors, underscoring the urgent shortage Microsoft and others are facing.Microsoft’s relationship with OpenAI — and its own slate of newly introduced AI services — are requiring computing power at a level beyond what the company expected when it ordered chips and set up data centers. OpenAI’s ChatGPT service has drawn interest from businesses that want to use it as part of their own products or corporate applications, and Microsoft has introduced a chat-based version of Bing and new AI-enhanced Office tools.It’s also updating older products like GitHub’s code-generating tool. All of those AI programs run in Microsoft’s Azure cloud and require the pricey and powerful processors Nvidia provides.The area is also a key priority for AMD. “We are very excited about our opportunity in AI — this is our No. 1 strategic priority,” Chief Executive Officer Lisa Su said during the chipmaker’s earnings call Tuesday. “We are in the very early stages of the AI computing era, and the rate of adoption and growth is faster than any other technology in recent history.”Su also said that AMD has an opportunity to make partly customized chips for its biggest customers to use in their AI data centers.From Bloomberg Businessweek: Doing, Not Just Chatting, Is the Next Stage of the AI Hype CycleBorkar’s team at Microsoft, which has also worked on chips for servers and Surface computers, is now prioritizing the Athena project. It’s developing a graphics processing unit that can be used for training and running AI models. The product is already being tested internally and could be more widely available as soon as next year, said one of the people.Even if the project makes that timeline, a first version is just a starting point, the people said. It takes years to build a good chip, and Nvidia has a substantial head start. Nvidia is the chip supplier of choice for many providers of tools for generative AI, including Amazon.com Inc.’s AWS and Google cloud, and Elon Musk has secured thousands of its processors for his fledgling AI business, according to reports.Creating an alternative to Nvidia’s lineup will be a challenging task. That company offers a package of software and hardware that works together — including chips, a programming language, networking equipment and servers — letting customers rapidly upgrade their capabilities.That’s one of the reasons Nvidia has become so dominant. But Microsoft isn’t alone in trying to develop in-house AI processors. Cloud rival Amazon acquired Annapurna Labs in 2016 and has developed two different AI processors. Alphabet Inc.’s Google also has a training chip of its own.(Adds Microsoft comment in third paragraph.

NVDA,FOCUS-China's AI industry barely slowed by US chip export rules,"(Adds details of Nvidia statement, paragraph 13)By Stephen Nellis, Josh Ye and Jane Lanhee LeeMay 3 (Reuters) - U.S. microchip export controls imposed last year to freeze China's development of supercomputers used to develop nuclear weapons and artificial-intelligence systems like ChatGPT are having only minimal effects on China's tech sector.The rules restricted shipments of Nvidia Corp and Advanced Micro Devices Inc chips that have become the global technology industry's standard for developing chatbots and other AI systems.But Nvidia has created variants of its chips for the Chinese market that are slowed down to meet U.S. rules. Industry experts told Reuters the newest one - the Nvidia H800, announced in March - will likely take 10% to 30% longer to carry out some AI tasks and could double some costs compared with Nvidia's fastest U.S. chips.Even the slowed Nvidia chips represent an improvement for Chinese firms. Tencent Holdings, one of China's largest tech companies, in April estimated that systems using Nvidia's H800 will cut the time it takes to train its largest AI system by more than half, from 11 days to four days.""The AI companies that we talk to seem to see the handicap as relatively small and manageable,"" said Charlie Chai, a Shanghai-based analyst with 86Research.The back-and-forth between government and industry exposes the U.S. challenge of slowing China's progress in high tech without hurting U.S. companies.Part of the U.S. strategy in setting the rules was to avoid such a shock that the Chinese would ditch U.S. chips altogether and redouble their own chip-development efforts.""They had to draw the line somewhere, and wherever they drew it, they were going to run into the challenge of how to not be immediately disruptive, but how to also over time degrade China's capability,"" said one chip industry executive who requested anonymity to talk about private discussions with regulators.The export restrictions have two parts. The first puts a ceiling on a chip's ability to calculate extremely precise numbers, a measure designed to limit supercomputers that can be used in military research. Chip industry sources said that was an effective action.But calculating extremely precise numbers is less relevant in AI work like large language models where the amount of data the chip can chew through is more important.Nvidia is selling the H800 to China's largest technology firms, including Tencent, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd and Baidu Inc for use in such work, though it has not yet started shipping the chips in high volumes.""The government isn’t seeking to harm competition or U.S. industry, and allows U.S. firms to supply products for commercial activities, such as providing cloud services for consumers,"" Nvidia said in a statement last week.China is an important market for U.S. technology companies, and selling products there helps create jobs for both Nvidia and its U.S.-based partners, the company added.""The October export controls require that we create products with an expanding gap between the two markets,"" Nvidia said last week. ""We comply with the regulation while offering as-competitive-as-possible products in each market.""Bill Dally, Nvidia's chief scientist, said in a separate statement this week that “this gap will grow quickly over time as training requirements continue to double every six to 12 months.""A spokesperson for the Bureau of Industry and Security, the arm of the U.S. Commerce Department that oversees the rules, did not return a request for comment.SLOWED BUT NOT STOPPEDThe second U.S. limit is on chip-to-chip transfer speeds, which does affect AI. The models behind technologies such as ChatGPT are too large to fit onto a single chip. Instead, they must be spread over many chips - often thousands at a time - which all need to communicate with one another.Nvidia has not disclosed the China-only H800 chip's performance details, but a specification sheet seen by Reuters shows a chip-to-chip speed of 400 gigabytes per second, less than half the peak speed of 900 gigabytes per second for Nvidia's flagship H100 chip available outside China.Some in the AI industry believe that is still plenty of speed. Naveen Rao, chief executive of a startup called MosaicML that specializes in helping AI models to run better on limited hardware, estimated a 10-30% system slowdown.""There are ways to get around all this algorithmically,"" he said. ""I don't see this being a boundary for a very long time - like 10 years.""Money helps. A chip in China that takes twice as long to finish an AI training task than a faster U.S. chip can still get the work done.""At that point, you've got to spend $20 million instead of $10 million to train it,"" said one industry source who requested anonymity because of agreements with partners. ""Does that suck? Yes it does. But does that mean this is impossible for Alibaba or Baidu? No, that's not a problem.""Moreover, AI researchers are trying to slim down the massive systems they have built to cut the cost of training products similar to ChatGPT and other processes. Those will require fewer chips, reducing chip-to-chip communications and lessening the impact of the U.S. speed limits.Two years ago the industry was thinking AI models would get bigger and bigger, said Cade Daniel, a software engineer at Anyscale, a San Francisco startup that provides software to help companies perform AI work.""If that were still true today, this export restriction would have a lot more impact,"" Daniel said. ""This export restriction is noticeable, but it's not quite as devastating as it could have been.""(Reporting by Stephen Nellis and Jane Lee in San Francisco and Josh Ye in Hong Kong Editing by Peter Henderson and Matthew Lewis)","May 3, 2023 at 2:46 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/focus-chinas-ai-industry-barely-194630467.html,Reuters,0.05,0.1,0.058592472342472335,0.41219035594035586

NVDA,FOCUS-China's AI industry barely slowed by US chip export rules,"By Stephen Nellis, Josh Ye and Jane Lanhee LeeMay 3 (Reuters) - U.S. microchip export controls imposed last year to freeze China's development of supercomputers used to develop nuclear weapons and artificial-intelligence systems like ChatGPT are having only minimal effects on China's tech sector.The rules restricted shipments of Nvidia Corp and Advanced Micro Devices Inc chips that have become the global technology industry's standard for developing chatbots and other AI systems.But Nvidia has created variants of its chips for the Chinese market that are slowed down to meet U.S. rules. Industry experts told Reuters the newest one - the Nvidia H800, announced in March - will likely take 10% to 30% longer to carry out some AI tasks and could double some costs compared with Nvidia's fastest U.S. chips.Even the slowed Nvidia chips represent an improvement for Chinese firms. Tencent Holdings, one of China's largest tech companies, in April estimated that systems using Nvidia's H800 will cut the time it takes to train its largest AI system by more than half, from 11 days to four days.""The AI companies that we talk to seem to see the handicap as relatively small and manageable,"" said Charlie Chai, a Shanghai-based analyst with 86Research.The back-and-forth between government and industry exposes the U.S. challenge of slowing China's progress in high tech without hurting U.S. companies.Part of the U.S. strategy in setting the rules was to avoid such a shock that the Chinese would ditch U.S. chips altogether and redouble their own chip-development efforts.""They had to draw the line somewhere, and wherever they drew it, they were going to run into the challenge of how to not be immediately disruptive, but how to also over time degrade China's capability,"" said one chip industry executive who requested anonymity to talk about private discussions with regulators.The export restrictions have two parts. The first puts a ceiling on a chip's ability to calculate extremely precise numbers, a measure designed to limit supercomputers that can be used in military research. Chip industry sources said that was an effective action.But calculating extremely precise numbers is less relevant in AI work like large language models where the amount of data the chip can chew through is more important.Nvidia is selling the H800 to China's largest technology firms, including Tencent, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd and Baidu Inc for use in such work, though it has not yet started shipping the chips in high volumes.""The government isn’t seeking to harm competition or U.S. industry, and allows U.S. firms to supply products for commercial activities, such as providing cloud services for consumers,"" Nvidia said in a statement last week.China is an important customer for U.S. technology, it added.""The October export controls require that we create products with an expanding gap between the two markets,"" Nvidia said last week. We comply with the regulation while offering as-competitive-as-possible products in each market.""Bill Dally, Nvidia's chief scientist, said in a separate statement this week that “this gap will grow quickly over time as training requirements continue to double every six to 12 months.""A spokesperson for the Bureau of Industry and Security, the arm of the U.S. Commerce Department that oversees the rules, did not return a request for comment.SLOWED BUT NOT STOPPEDThe second U.S. limit is on chip-to-chip transfer speeds, which does affect AI. The models behind technologies such as ChatGPT are too large to fit onto a single chip. Instead, they must be spread over many chips - often thousands at a time - which all need to communicate with one another.Nvidia has not disclosed the China-only H800 chip's performance details, but a specification sheet seen by Reuters shows a chip-to-chip speed of 400 gigabytes per second, less than half the peak speed of 900 gigabytes per second for Nvidia's flagship H100 chip available outside China.Some in the AI industry believe that is still plenty of speed. Naveen Rao, chief executive of a startup called MosaicML that specializes in helping AI models to run better on limited hardware, estimated a 10-30% system slowdown.""There are ways to get around all this algorithmically,"" he said. ""I don't see this being a boundary for a very long time - like 10 years.""Money helps. A chip in China that takes twice as long to finish an AI training task than a faster U.S. chip can still get the work done.""At that point, you've got to spend $20 million instead of $10 million to train it,"" said one industry source who requested anonymity because of agreements with partners.

NVDA,"AMD Q1 earnings: Beats on revenue and EPS, but chip sales drop 64%","Here are the most important numbers from the report compared to what Wall Street expected from the chip maker, as compiled by Bloomberg.Shares were down roughly 4% following the announcement.“We executed very well in the first quarter as we delivered better than expected revenue and earnings in a mixed demand environment,” AMD CEO Dr. Lisa Su said in a statement.“We launched multiple leadership products and made significant progress accelerating our AI roadmap and customer engagements in the quarter. Longer-term, we see significant growth opportunities as we successfully deliver our roadmaps, execute our strategic data center and embedded priorities and accelerate adoption of our AI portfolio.”CFO Jean Hu, meanwhile, said that the company is confident in second-half growth in both its Data Center and Client segments, which should offset ""modest declines"" in its Gaming and Embedded businesses.Second quarter revenue is expected to come in between $5 billion and $5.6 billion. Analysts called for $5.51 billion.The PC market is experiencing some of its worst performance in years, as consumers and businesses pull back on purchasing new computers amid increased interest rates.That said, the pain in the PC market also may have reached a bottom. According to Morgan Stanley Research equity analyst Erik Woodring, “pockets of demand are slowly emerging.”Woodring says that for the first time in six months, PCs built, which make up 75% of shipments, have been revised upward in two consecutive months.

NVDA,12 Best Video Game Stocks to Buy Now,"“Selling plenty of product may be a great outcome for GPU vendors, but the artificial price inflation caused by stock shortages is a less welcome look for any mainstream company [...] The company’s true customers – the end users who were after the product in the first place – end up feeling outmaneuvered by and aggrieved at the company itself, not the buyers who flipped for quick money.”Our MethodologyFor our list of best video game stocks, we chose the 12 video game companies listed on NYSE and NASDAQ based on their hedge fund sentiment as of the fourth quarter of 2022. The chosen companies are either entirely focused on gaming, have a separate gaming division in the company, or provide products that are focused on the gaming industry.The hedge fund sentiment around each stock has been taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 943 elite hedge funds.Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 28Sony Group Corporation (NYSE:SONY) released its Q4 results on April 28, where it reported a GAAP EPS of ¥103.53 (1 Japanese Yen = 0.0073 USD) and revenue of ¥3.06 trillion, up 35.3% YoY. For FY 2024, the company provided revenue guidance of ¥11.5 trillion and ¥840 billion for net income.“Sony Group Corporation (NYSE:SONY), the global provider of video games and consoles, image sensors, and music, as well as movies, was a major detractor for the period. The share price of the company has struggled this year following its strong performance in 2021. Signs of a slowdown in the gaming industry (as people seem inclined to take on outdoor activities as pandemic fears have subsided), combined with sales of its PlayStation 5 that have been held up by a global parts shortage, have led to gaming‐related software sales falling more than 20% year‐over‐year. Rather than focusing on short‐term demand dislocations, we focus on the company’s ability to continue migrating videogame users toward the firm’s subscription offerings, as well as its capacity to leverage content across its video, music and gaming platforms. We are also impressed with the expansion of Sony’s Music segment, which has been supported by the pervasiveness of streaming services. Management’s ongoing work to improve the company’s TV and film studios is bearing fruit as well, with sales growing 67% year‐over‐year for its Pictures segment as its regional strategy has taken hold, including recent progress made toward solidifying a merger plan with India‐based Zee Entertainment. All of this is to say we remain excited by the oligopolistic nature of the businesses Sony operates in, and the future prospects for the company given its leadership in image sensors, music publishing and gaming consoles.”Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 29Roblox Corporation (NYSE:RBLX) is a California-based gaming and multimedia company. It runs an online game creation system where the users can create games and play games created by other users.

Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD) with a combined value of nearly $1.35 billion.“Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD) – Media conglomerate Warner Bros Discovery (WBD) was the top contributor in the quarter. WBD was a top detractor last year in the face of concerns over management’s ability to effectively merge two businesses with different cultures, high leverage and exposure to cord cutting. In 2023, a solid plan is emerging for the integration of the businesses. This management team has a strong track record of integrating assets and growing free cash flow (FCF) per share, which is beginning to happen at WBD. Management has guided that the company will likely be below 4 times net debt to EBITDA by the end of 2023 and to 3x or less by the end of 2024, taking WBD out of the penalty box. We have seen this management team successfully execute this playbook before when Discovery bought former Southeastern holding Scripps in 2017. We are also finally beginning to see industry price rationality across the streaming world.”  Suggested articles:10 Best May Dividend Stocks To Buy10 Most Profitable Businesses With Least Investment 202325 Countries with The Highest Standard of Living in 2023","May 2, 2023 at 12:53 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/12-best-video-game-stocks-175314253.html,Insider Monkey,0.3,0.35,0.08427747329123474,0.42945867588069403

NVDA,Those who invested in NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) five years ago are up 369%,"So let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress. View our latest analysis for NVIDIA During five years of share price growth, NVIDIA achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 6.9% per year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 36% per year, over the same period. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did five years ago. And that's hardly shocking given the track record of growth. This optimism is visible in its fairly high P/E ratio of 156.66.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for NVIDIA the TSR over the last 5 years was 369%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.","April 30, 2023 at 7:00 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/those-invested-nvidia-nasdaq-nvda-120022304.html,Simply Wall St.,0.0,0.0,0.11319327731092438,0.49177871148459384

NVDA,"Keep on Buying Nvidia Stock Ahead of Earnings, Says Morgan Stanley","In fact, with a view to next month’s F1Q earnings (May 24), Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore thinks all the hoopla around AI should result in a strong report.“We see a positive setup for NVIDIA in this quarter’s earnings, with checks indicating that the significant enthusiasm we’ve seen from AI adopters has translated into reacceleration for data center (DC) product,” the 5-star analyst said.Moore also sees the flagship AI chip H100 and the return of its predecessor, the A100, driving the quarter’s growth.Moreover, looking ahead, with Nvidia’s state-of-the-art AI/ML hardware solutions given a proper boost from all the enthusiasm around generative AI, over the next 5 years, the DC business should be responsible for much of the anticipated growth.But not only the DC segment. Moore also gives a shout out to Nvidia’s once main breadwinner – Gaming. After several quarters of declining growth, the segment showed signs it was coming back to life in FQ4 (January quarter) and with anticipated tailwinds from 40-series product over the course of the year, Moore sees an “opportunity for the company to reaccelerate growth in the gaming business.”Disclaimer: The opinions expressed in this article are solely those of the featured analyst.

NVDA,"Intel Q1 earnings: Chip maker beats expectations, revenue plummets 36%","Intel is struggling with a steep decline in both PC and datacenter sales, as consumers and businesses pull back on spending. PC revenue was off a whopping 38% in the quarter, while datacenter revenue fell 39%.Here are the most important numbers from the quarter compared to Wall Street analysts are expecting from the company in the quarter compared to data from Bloomberg.Shares of Intel were down more than 1% following the announcement.We delivered solid first-quarter results, representing steady progress with our transformation,” Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger said in a statement.“We hit key execution milestones in our data center roadmap and demonstrated the health of the process technology underpinning it. While we remain cautious on the macroeconomic outlook, we are focused on what we can control as we deliver on IDM 2.0: driving consistent execution across process and product roadmaps and advancing our foundry business to best position us to capitalize on the $1 trillion market opportunity ahead.”Shares of Intel are down as much as 36% over the last 12 months, while AMD shares are roughly flat. Nvidia, which is a major provider of AI chips, is up as much as 43%. And while general market sentiment toward tech names has improved since the start of 2023, with the Nasdaq up 14%, Intel continues to trudge along.The company’s share price is up just 9% since January, while AMD has jumped 31% and Nvidia has rocketed up 84%.Gelsinger, however, is attempting to steer the chip giant toward a new era of growth by building out new fabrication facilities in the U.S., including a massive $20 billion chip plant in Ohio. And ahead of earnings on Thursday, Intel announced a multi-generation collaboration with chip designer Arm.But Intel’s larger problem might just be the slowdown in the overall PC market. Consumers and businesses stocked up on new PCs during the pandemic, and as interest rates have jumped, both categories of customers are pulling back on spending on new systems.According to Gartner, worldwide PC shipments collapsed 30% year-over-year in the first quarter of 2023 to 55.2 million units.

NVDA,Silicon Wars: Inside the battle for market share in the chip space,"Yahoo Finance’s Daniel Howley joins the Live show to discuss the battle for market share in the chip space amid declining chip demand.The street currently expecting a 15% share loss. Let's get to Yahoo Finances Tech Editor Dan Howley for more on this battle for market share. Dan, what are you watching?And that stockpile now is not being used because people are cutting back on buying. And that includes consumers, as well as commercial buyers. So that's where the memory issues are coming from. Samsung then has little reason or little ability to sell them at price. So they're having to either cut price or, as they said in their announcement, scale back on production until they start to see inventory levels start to even out.Now, on Intel's side of things, they're going to report after the bell today. And we are expecting another decline there from the company. Revenue expectations are for $11.1 billion. That would be down from $18.4 billion-- excuse me-- in Q1 of 2022. We're expecting an adjusted loss per share of $0.15. That's down from an adjusted increase of $0.87 a share.The big deals here are the client computing and data center and AI divisions. Client computing, that's basically where the chips were made that go into things like PCs. That is expected to come in at $49 billion compared to 9.-- sorry-- 4.9 billion-- excuse me-- versus 9.3 billion in Q1 2022. And then on the data center side of things, it's expected to be $3.5 billion versus $6 billion in 2022.So I think the broader question here is we're all talking about AI NVIDIA. I mean, share prices for them are absolutely through the roof. They've rocketed since January 84%. And so why aren't we seeing the same thing out of Intel? Well, because Intel's exposure to AI isn't nearly as large as NVIDIA. NVIDIA basically hit a gold mine here.They have graphics chips. Graphics chips are great at processing multiple streams of data. And so they're perfect for AI capabilities. That's whether putting together the types of algorithms that are used in AI or putting them into use. So they are great for that. That's why we're seeing companies go and buy up tons of Intel, as well as AMD.Don't forget, they have their graphics line of products. And they're able to do the exact same thing. Intel, they make CPUs mostly. And so CPUs, they're just not built right for AI computation. And so, as a result, we're seeing fewer companies look towards Intel for AI. In fact, if you look at what we had seen from reports about Meta from a Reuters report, they had said that Meta was struggling with their AI side because they were using CPUs rather than GPUs.Now, whether or not they were using Intel or NVIDIA's, besides the point, that's just to illustrate that CPUs are not built for this kind of function. So now that we're seeing more people pile into that, I don't think that we're going to get the kind of boost out of Intel that we may from NVIDIA or AMD because of that wave of AI.","April 27, 2023 at 10:41 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/silicon-wars-inside-battle-market-154134904.html,Yahoo Finance Video,0.0,0.0,0.12250721500721501,0.43013038548752835

(NASDAQ:GOOG) also have their own AI chips, Inferentia and TPU respectively.""It's not just the top three or four hyperscalers, you know, remember each of them used to be a startup at one point and they displaced the incumbent. And now what we have in the valley is three or four hundred startup companies that are trying to develop new and innovative applications with this new technology. So when they do that they need compute power that is available on the cloud and that is where the need for GPUs, we think, can grow even faster than what we had anticipated last year.""Our MethodologyWe screened for semiconductor equipment stocks using Yahoo Finance’s stock screener.

NVDA,NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,"Shares of this maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence have returned -0.6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +2.6% change. The Zacks Semiconductor - General industry, to which Nvidia belongs, has lost 2.8% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Nvidia is expected to post earnings of $0.92 per share, indicating a change of -32.4% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.1% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $4.50 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +34.7%. This estimate has changed +0.8% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.98 indicates a change of +32.9% from what Nvidia is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.2%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Nvidia is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Nvidia, the consensus sales estimate of $6.5 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -21.6%. The $29.68 billion and $37.11 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +10% and +25%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryNvidia reported revenues of $6.05 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -20.8%. EPS of $0.88 for the same period compares with $1.32 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.01 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.61%. The EPS surprise was +8.64%.Over the last four quarters, Nvidia surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Nvidia is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Nvidia. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) : Free Stock Analysis ReportTo read this article on Zacks.com click here.Zacks Investment Research","April 26, 2023 at 8:00 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-corporation-nvda-trending-stock-130001777.html,Zacks,0.0,0.0,0.09022817460317462,0.45110780423280405

NVDA,Nvidia releases software tools to help chatbots watch their language,"By Stephen Nellis(Reuters) - Nvidia Corp, a major supplier of chips and computing systems for artificial intelligence, on Tuesday released a set of software tools aimed at helping chatbots watch their language.Nvidia's chips have helped companies like Microsoft Corp add human-like chat features to search engines like Bing.

NVDA,Executives know the generative A.I. boom is a big dealbut are afraid to use the technology,"How should companies think about using generative A.I.? While many businesses have rushed to embrace the technology, putting it directly into customer-facing products, many others are hesitant, afraid of copyright issues, the tendency of large language models to hallucinate (the A.I. industry’s preferred term for making up information), and worries about how expensive it is to run generative A.I. models at scale.Worryingly, 68% of executives said their company had not appointed an individual to serve as the main lead for their company’s exploration of generative A.I. What’s more, while 90% of those responding to the survey said they had “moderate to highly significant” concerns about the risks of using generative A.I. and doubts about how to mitigate those risks, only 6% said they felt their company had a mature A.I. governance program in place.Nvidia, the semiconductor company whose graphics processing units (GPUs) have become the go-to computer chips for running generative A.I. has clearly gotten the message that businesses' concerns about risk are holding back adoption. That in turn might slow sales of Nvidia’s GPUs. In an effort to help businesses become more comfortable with generative A.I., Nvidia today announced an open-source platform it calls NeMo Guardrails that is designed to make it easy for companies to create safeguards around the use of large language models (LLMs). (Businesses can also access NeMo guardrails through Nvidia’s paid, cloud-based NeMo A.I. service—which is part of the semiconductor giant’s first foray into selling A.I. models and services directly to customers.)NeMo Guardrails uses Python in the background to execute scripts using LangChang, the popular open-source framework for turning LLMs into applications that can integrate with other software. LangChang’s programming interface is similar to natural language, making it easier for even those without much coding expertise to create the guardrails. For some of the NeMo guardrails, the system deploys other language models to police the primary LLM’s output, Jonathan Cohen, Nvidia’s vice president of applied research, says.But while NeMo Guardrails may help soothe businesses' fears about some of the risks of using generative A.I., it won’t necessarily help allay their worries about the cost. Cohen admits that, depending on the kind of guardrails being implemented, NeMo Guardrails could increase the cost of running an LLM-based application.With that here’s the rest of this week’s A.I. news.","April 25, 2023 at 12:05 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/executives-know-generative-boom-big-170526293.html,Fortune,-0.3,0.5,0.14698660714285716,0.545796130952381
NVDA,25 Biggest Cloud Providers by Revenue,"And lastly, we are going to lead in the AI era, knowing that maximum enterprise value gets created during platform shifts. With that as the backdrop, the Microsoft Cloud exceeded $27 billion in quarterly revenue, up 22% and 29% in constant currency. Now, I will highlight examples of our innovation starting with Azure. Moving to the cloud is the best way for any customer in today’s economy to mitigate demand uncertainty and energy costs while gaining efficiencies of cloud native development. Enterprises have moved millions of calls to Azure and run twice as many calls on our cloud today than they did 2 years ago. And yet, we are still in the early innings when it comes to long-term cloud opportunity.As an example, insurer AIA was able to save more than 20% by migrating to Azure and reduced IT provisioning time from multiple months to just an hour. We also continue to lead with hybrid computing with Azure Arc. We now have more than 12,000 Arc customers, double the number a year ago, including companies like Citrix, Northern Trust and PayPal. Now on to data. Customers continue to choose and implement the Microsoft Intelligent Data Platform over the competition because of its comprehensiveness, integration and lower cost. Bayer, for example, used the data stack to evaluate results from clinical trials faster and more efficiently while meeting regulatory requirements and ASOS chose Cosmos DB to power real-time product recommendations and order processing for over 26 million global customers.Now on to AI. The age of AI is upon us and Microsoft is powering it. We are witnessing non-linear improvements in capability of foundation models, which we are making available as platforms. And as customers select their cloud providers and invest in new workloads, we are well positioned to capture that opportunity as a leader in AI. We have the most powerful AI supercomputing infrastructure in the cloud. It’s being used by customers and partners like OpenAI to train state-of-the-art models and services, including ChatGPT. Just last week, we made our Azure OpenAI service broadly available and already over 200 customers from KPMG to Al Jazeera are using it. We will soon add support for ChatGPT, enabling customers to use it in their own applications for the first time.Photo by Taylor Vick on UnsplashOur Methodology To compile our list of the world's largest cloud providers in terms of revenue, we first cast a wide net and listed all firms that operate in the space, such as those that provide hardware, computing resources, and cloud products built on top of them.

This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Tesla is expected to post earnings of $0.84 per share, indicating a change of +10.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -11.1% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.62 points to a change of -11.1% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -8%.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.80 indicates a change of +32.5% from what Tesla is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -6.1%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Tesla is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Tesla, the consensus sales estimate of $24.4 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +44.1%. The $99.41 billion and $124.89 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +22% and +25.6%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryTesla reported revenues of $23.33 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +24.4%. EPS of $0.85 for the same period compares with $1.07 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $23.59 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -1.11%. The EPS surprise was +2.41%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Tesla is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Tesla. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Tesla, Inc.

TSLA,Analysis-Battle for China's electric SUV market heats up at home and abroad,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China is ground zero for the price war in electric vehicles and the battleground is shifting to SUV-styled EVs, the largest segment of the market, dominated by Tesla Inc and BYD.The market, crowded with more than 90 models, is about to get even tighter with at least 20 new models of both Chinese and foreign brands launched in April, squeezing pricing and margins at home and driving exports, analysts and executives said.EV makers in China have followed Tesla's bold price cuts by lowering prices for their own electric SUVs, cannabalising sales of internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles as the price gap between the technologies narrows, analysts said.The trend will spread abroad with growing exports of China-made electric SUVs.""We're going to see a lot of Chinese exports because of the ultra-competitive market in China. It's actually going to be a pressure release valve,"" said Tu Le, founder of Beijing-based advisory firm Sino Auto Insights.The market for SUVs has boomed in China over the past decade and now represents almost 40% of all cars sold, with 400 SUV models of all fuel types.Almost as many China-made SUVs were sold in 2022 as cars of any type in Europe last year, or more than 11 million.The popularity of electric SUVs has exploded since Tesla delivered its domestically-produced Model Y two years ago in China, making it one of the fastest-growing segments in the world's largest auto market.GRAPHIC: Chasing Tesla - https://www.reuters.com/graphics/CHINA-SUVS/PRICING/gdvzqjgenpw/chart.pngBoth domestic and foreign brands were represented among the new models rolled out at the Shanghai Auto Show in April.Legacy automakers Volkswagen, BMW and Toyota are counting on new electric SUVs to bolster China sales.Made-in-China EV startups Xpeng and Nio have six SUV models and the EV-only brands launched by Chinese state-owned car companies, such as GAC's Aion are also pushing all-electric SUVs.They will compete with 93 existing electric SUV models in a market that saw 1.5 million sales in 2022, with the top 10 brands making up 84%, a Reuters analysis of data from China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) shows.There were 76 electric SUVs in 2020 before Tesla started producing Model Ys in China, with average annual sales amounting to just 3,000 units.GRAPHIC: China's Love for SUVs is Growing - https://www.reuters.com/graphics/CHINA-SUVS/PRICING/dwpkdleenvm/chart.pngDespite recent minor price hikes, Tesla's Model Y is still 20% cheaper in China than in early October, when the U.S. automaker grappled with rising inventory.DISCOUNT WARXpeng, Leapmotor and others have fired back with their own discounts, while BYD offered a discount of $1,000 on its market-leading Song Plus SUV, or about 4% off.Those refusing to slash prices on existing models to protect brand value have instead chosen to offer lower-than-expected starting prices for new models, along with longer driving ranges and greater autonomous driving features.For example, Geely's premium EV brand Zeekr priced its new compact crossover Zeekr X from $27,500, 28% cheaper than Model Y and almost the same price as Honda's CR-V, first-quarter sales of which slumped 56%.Mitsubishi Motors also said last week it had suspended for three months production of its Outlander SUV in China.The reality is ""brutal"" for legacy foreign brands targeting the mass market with small SUVs priced below $40,000, such as Ford, said Le of Sino Auto Insights.Ford's chief executive, Jim Farley, acknowledged the intense market competition for two-row, SUV-styled EVs as a factor driving China's car export boom.""That's why they're going big on Europe. Europe is a premium export market. They're all going there,"" Farley said in April after a trip to China.Ford will also restructure its China operations to turn one of its joint ventures into an export hub for low-cost commercial electric and combustion vehicles, Farley said last week.General Motors, which saw profit from China tumble by almost a fourth in the most recent quarter, needs new EVs to be a success in order to rebuild its market share in China, but the pressure is intense.""China has 100 vehicle brands vying for sales and a 50% capacity utilization rate,"" Chief Executive Mary Barra said.Tesla and Renault have already been exporting their China-made electric SUVs to Europe on a large scale. Tesla will begin shipping Model Y crossovers from its Shanghai plant to Canada, its first exports to North America, Reuters reported.Chinese automakers have their own plans to grow electric SUV sales to Europe.Zeekr said it would bring the Zeekr X to western Europe while exports of BYD's Atto 3 SUV more than doubled in the first quarter as it started taking orders there.""The styling of it (Atto 3) is in keeping with the higher driving position, the good space,"" said Mark Blundell, BYD's head of marketing in Britain.""We just feel it's a good start point for us in the UK.""($1=6.9000 Chinese yuan renminbi)(Reporting by Zhang Yan and Brenda Goh in Shanghai; Additional reporting by Nick Carey in London; Editing by Ben Klayman and Clarence Fernandez)","May 7, 2023 at 8:08 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysis-battle-chinas-electric-suv-010850276.html,Reuters,0.0,0.0,0.13443001443001446,0.36565295815295806

TSLA,Richest Man in Vietnam Reinforces Risky $8 Billion Wager on EVs,"(Bloomberg) — It’s a familiar story: A business mogul parlaying much of his fortune into a massive bet on electric vehicles, only to fall on hard times.Most Read from BloombergTexas Mass Shooting’s Bloody Images Add to Fervor in Gun DebatePowell’s Bet Against Recession Looks Good — Minus the Credit Crunch and a DC StandoffFootball Stadiums Belong in the SuburbsBiden Trails Trump as His Approval Rating Hits Low in ABC PollBuffett Reaffirms Abel as Heir, Blames Bank Leaders for FailuresPham Nhat Vuong is among the latest to take after Elon Musk, the PayPal mafia member who made it through what he famously described as Tesla Inc.’s “production hell.” Other examples include James Dyson, the household-appliance billionaire; Jia Yueting, founder of the Netflix of China; and Hui Ka Yan, the embattled property tycoon behind China Evergrande Group.The odds that any of these players ride out the inferno as Tesla did are looking increasingly long. Dyson pulled the plug on his EV venture in 2019. Jia’s Faraday Future Intelligent Electric Inc. is staring down a potential Nasdaq delisting. And Hui’s China Evergrande New Energy Vehicle Group Ltd. is struggling to survive.Vuong’s difficulties are proving costly. VinFast, his automaker that filed for a initial public offering a year ago, has delayed plans to list in the US. Vingroup JSC — Vuong’s conglomerate spanning homes, hotels, hospitals and shopping malls — and its affiliates and lenders have deployed a staggering $8.2 billion to fund the car company’s operating expenses and capital expenditures the last six years.The return on all that investment has been meager: VinFast sold just 93,000 vehicles and 162,000 e-scooters.Vuong has only doubled down, lining up another $2.5 billion for VinFast, $1 billion of which will come from him personally. This month, the company plans to start delivering longer-range versions of its VF 8 sport utility vehicles to US customers.What’s still unclear is how quickly those SUVs will catch on in what is an increasingly cutthroat EV market, with Tesla slashing prices and putting pressure on incumbents that have been around more than a century. VinFast will need to spend heavily to familiarize Americans with its brand and set up networks for distribution and retailing vehicles, not to mention overcome the growing pains Musk endured when trying to mass manufacture cars.“Can VinFast run a marathon and sacrifice the short term for the long term?” asks Alexander Vuving, a professor who specializes in power politics and Vietnam at the Honolulu-based Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies. He said it’s likely the company will need deep pockets to sustain losses for many years.Representatives for Vingroup declined to comment on Vuong’s plans beyond the company’s statement last month saying he would redouble his funding commitments to VinFast.Noodle BeginningsVuong, 54, is Vietnam’s richest man, with a $3.9 billion net worth, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. He started his own business while studying in Moscow and has said he left Russia with $40,000 in debt. He started a dried-foods company in Ukraine in the early ’90s that sold instant noodles and mashed potatoes and sold it to Nestle SA for an undisclosed sum in 2010.Soon after starting VinFast, Vuong spoke openly about his ambition to sell cars in the US and his willingness to spend as much as $2 billion of his fortune toward achieving that goal.VinFast made many headlines last year, starting with its announcement in January that it would cease making gas-powered cars. In March, US President Joe Biden praised its plans to build a $4 billion EV factory in North Carolina. The following month, it filed confidentially for an IPO.But there was trouble brewing at the top of the company around this time. Michael Lohscheller, a veteran auto executive hired away from leading German carmaker Opel, lasted only a matter of months as VinFast’s global chief executive officer. The company said in December 2021 that Lohscheller left for personal reasons. Truckmaker Nikola Corp. hired him months later.Weeks after its confidential filing, Vuong said during a Vingroup shareholder meeting that VinFast might delay the IPO until 2023, citing supply-chain issues and market uncertainties. The parent company nonetheless hosted reporters from Bloomberg and other outlets for tours of its car factory in Haiphong, north of Hanoi, treating media, influencers, customers and business partners to a champagne and lobster lunch.Mixed ReviewsThe reviews were mixed. A writer for the blog Jalopnik called VinFast’s SUV “simply not ready for America.” Car and Driver referred to some “quirks” — the accelerator was jumpy in one vehicle and laggy in another — while acknowledging these may have just been “prototype pains.” The Autopian headlined its post: I Drove A VinFast VF8 And It Wasn’t As Bad As I Expected.VinFast plowed ahead, staging a ceremony in November at a port in Haiphong for the first 999 EVs it shipped to California.Some arrived at the Port of Benicia in San Francisco Bay without battery power, according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified. The company said there were no issues with the vehicles, and that it’s normal for batteries to deplete while in transit for multiple reasons, such as doors not being fully shut.VinFast’s plans for first deliveries to customers slipped from late December to January, then to February. Late that month, the company announced it would slash initial lease customers’ monthly payments in half, charging $399 a month. It finally handed over its first 45 SUVs to customers in California on March 1 and now has 310 vehicles on US roads, with another 100 due for delivery soon.Time and MoneyWhile Biden gave VinFast a small boost with his shout-out of the company’s US factory plans, his landmark climate bill was somewhat of a setback. The Inflation Reduction Act will benefit manufacturers that already have EV and battery plants up and running; VinFast has warned that its North Carolina facility won’t start production until 2025.“The Inflation Reduction Act really puts a lot of pressure on them, because it undermines their cost and price advantage that they probably wanted to have until they can have manufacturing here, which is incredibly expensive,” said Mike Ramsey, an auto analyst for Gartner, the executive consultancy. “They did get kneecapped by the IRA, but they also got kneecapped by the reality of trying to pull off an expansion in a far-flung market.”Setting up networks for distribution, replacement parts and service will be no easy tasks, and without them, consumers won’t have peace of mind that their vehicles can be repaired, said Steve Man, a Hong Kong-based automotive analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence.“I believe their lofty goals are achievable,” Man said. “But it will take time and a lot of capital.”—With assistance from Nguyen Kieu Giang.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekWhy Launch Rockets When You Can Just Fling Them Into Space?Even $500 Million a Year From Google Isn’t Enough to Save FirefoxAirbus Bets on a Stretched A220 Jet to Beat Boeing’s 737Biden Administration Tamps Down Talk of US-China DecouplingData Science Is the Hot New Master’s at B-Schools©2023 Bloomberg L.P.","May 7, 2023 at 4:00 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/richest-man-vietnam-reinforces-risky-210010412.html,Bloomberg,0.0,0.0,0.028787878787878796,0.4255111354508947
TSLA,Buffett on investing in EVs: 'You won't see anyone that owns the market',"It's premature to declare any winners in the electric vehicle competition, Warren Buffett said on Saturday. There's just too much uncertainty in the sector.Buffett alluded to Ford as a cautionary tale of how unsteady the auto industry can be: ""Henry Ford looked like he owned the world with the Model T ... and 20 years later they were losing money,"" he said.Berkshire also owns roughly 50 million shares in General Motors, worth $1.68 billion as of Dec. 2022, but sold some of its GM stock in the second and third quarters of 2022.But Buffett and his right-hand man Charlie Munger said they didn't have an interest in venturing further into the auto business.""Charlie [Munger] and I long have felt that the auto industry is just too tough,"" Buffett said. ""It’s just a business where you’ve got a lot of worldwide competitors, they're not going to go away, and it looks like there are winners at any given time, but it doesn’t get you a permanent place.""Munger agreed, adding that although EVs are certainly on the rise, that uptick comes with some significant costs.""The electric vehicle is coming big time, and that’s a very interesting development,"" Munger said.

TSLA,This week in EVs: The Tesla-Ford price war,"Investing.com -- Here is your weekly Pro Recap of the past week's biggest headlines in the electric vehicle space: U.S. hits pause on EV RFS plans; Tesla pumps prices as Ford slashes to compete; GM guilty of more than cutting jobs; and Fisker makes a special delivery.Chatter spread Monday morning that the U.S. government might be putting the brakes on handing out tradable credits to electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers under a renewable fuel scheme, per reports that cited unnamed sources. According to the sources, supporters of the plan are pushing pause as they are worried about potential legal challenges.The plan would give EV automakers such as Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) credits for charging vehicles using power generated from renewable natural gas, or methane.The EPA recommended adding EVs to the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) last year and said it was considering public comments on the proposed change, but would not comment further on whether it would split out EVs from the mandate.Tesla made headlines this week by unexpectedly increasing the prices of its Model 3 and Model Y vehicles in the United States, China, Japan, and Canada. This price hike comes as a surprise, as it is the first time Tesla has raised the price of the Model 3 since January, after several price cuts earlier in the year.But they didn’t stop there. Tesla also raised the prices of its Model S and Model X vehicles in China, according to its website on Friday. The company appears to be maintaining a higher price point for these models in China, positioning them in the premium segment of the country's electric car market.Despite the changes this week, Tesla vehicles are still priced lower than they were at the beginning of the year.TSLA shares added 5.4% this week.Rival automaker Ford (NYSE:F) followed Tesla’s unexpected price hikes by slashing the prices of its Mustang Mach-E on Tuesday. Ford said it would be reducing most Mach-E prices by $3,000 to $4,000, depending on the specific version.But Ford CEO Jim Farley expressed concern about the ongoing EV price war the very next day, calling it a ""worrying trend."" He drew comparisons to Henry Ford's series of price cuts for the Model T in 1913, which eventually put the company's future in jeopardy.Despite these concerns, Farley said Ford would face Tesla head on and cut prices on models such as the Mustang Mach-E, which directly competes with Tesla's Model Y. It remains to be seen how this price war will play out and impact both companies in the long run.Farley added: ""There’s a limit to how far we’ll go.""General Motors (NYSE:GM) started the week off with a cost-cutting move, reportedly letting go of several hundred full-time contract workers over the weekend. This move is part of the company's larger goal to reduce its budget by $2 billion by the end of next year.These job cuts come on the heels of a voluntary separation package offered to 5,000 salaried employees about a month ago. GM claimed the voluntary program would help it achieve close to 50% of its cost-cutting goal, and that no further involuntary cuts would be necessary.Unfortunately, things did not improve for General Motors over the course of the week. Reports emerged that the company had pleaded guilty in a worker safety case related to the death of an employee at its St. Catharines facility in Canada.The company was fined $325,000.

TSLA,New Car Market: Prices Are About To Plummet Due to Oversupply,"A recent report from UBS estimates that global car production will exceed sales by 6% this year, leaving an excess of 5 million vehicles that will require price cuts to get sold off of lots, Yahoo Finance reported. Although those price cuts might not happen until the latter half of 2023, automakers are preparing for a price war, and some electric vehicle makers are already slashing prices.“Given the bullish production schedules, we see high risk of overproduction and growing pricing pressure as a result,” UBS said in a note to clients. “The price war has already started unfolding in the EV space, and we expect it to spread into the combustion engine segment [during the second half of 2023].”Makers of family cars are most likely to suffer from price cuts, the analysts said, while luxury carmakers are expected to hold up better.EV makers might take a major hit due to the combination of soaring energy costs and high prices that put many consumers out of reach, Yahoo Finance noted. In January, Elon Musk’s Tesla slashed the price of its cars by up to £8,000 in the U.K. Some of its cheaper models are now around the same price range as mass market brands such as Kia.Ford Motor Company and Lucid are among the other car manufacturers that have reacted to Tesla’s cuts by lowering their own EV prices, according to the Proactive Investors website.Meanwhile, there is already evidence that car prices across all segments have softened. The latest data from Cox Automotive, released on Friday, April 7, showed that wholesale used-vehicle prices in March fell 2.4% from a year earlier, although they did tick up 1.5% from the previous month.A March 23 report from Kelley Blue Book found that new vehicle prices dropped for three straight months, and that “it’s starting to look like a sustained trend.” Even so, prices remain “historically high.”More From GOBankingRates10 Aldi Brand Products Worth BuyingLearn To Master Your Money With These Financial Tips3 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000Financial Insight in Your Inbox: Sign Up for GBR's Daily Newsletter","May 6, 2023 at 2:00 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/car-market-prices-plummet-due-153706713.html,GOBankingRates,0.005681818181818177,0.4147727272727273,0.09762878787878787,0.3566515151515151

TSLA,Is Teslas $40K Electric Car Really a Bargain Now That the Price Has Been Slashed 6 Times?,"Cutting $2,000 off the Model 3, it has a base cost of $39,990, making it a relative “bargain” among EVs. This is true even though it is still more expensive than many hybrid plug-ins and 2023 EV models, like the Chevy Bolt EUV, the Mazda MX-30, the Hyundai Kona Electric and the Kia Nero EV, per Edmunds rankings.However, the Model 3 is now less than the average price of a new car, making it a more affordable option for consumers looking to switch over to an electric vehicle. Back in February, when the Model 3 was priced at $42,990, Bloomberg reported that it was selling for $4,930 less than the average new American vehicle.This is the sixth time Tesla has cut prices on its electric vehicles this year and second time this month. As CNN reported, the decision to lower prices and ensuing lower short-term profits was necessary, according to CEO Elon Musk.“While we reduced prices considerably in early Q1, it’s worth noting that our operating margin remains among the best in the industry,” Musk said. “We’ve taken a view that pushing for higher volumes and a larger fleet is the right choice here versus a lower volume and higher margins.”Unfortunately for existing and future Model 3 owners, the price cuts, which were announced prior to the company’s first-quarter earnings report of April 19, coincide with the reductions in EV credits imposed by the U.S. Treasury which went into effect April 18. Credits for the Model 3 have been slashed to $3,750, but all other Tesla models will still be eligible for the full $7,500 credit as mandated by the Inflation Reduction Act.According to Engadget, Tesla also cut the price on the consumer favorite Model Y. The base, Long Range and the Performance Model Y vehicles have been trimmed by $3,000 and now cost $46,990, $49,990 and $53,990, respectively.More From GOBankingRates10 Aldi Brand Products Worth BuyingLearn To Master Your Money With These Financial Tips3 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000Financial Insight in Your Inbox: Sign Up for GBR's Daily Newsletter","May 6, 2023 at 8:30 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-40k-electric-car-really-171352604.html,GOBankingRates,0.2,0.2,0.040280784030784035,0.4132816257816258

TSLA,Tesla is finally disclosing the full extent of its carbon emissions,"Read moreA look back at BTS as it became the world's top-selling actYour anxiety brings 4 distinct superpowersAmericans may have seen the last of big rent hikesInstead, it turns out that the previously uncounted Scope 3 emissions make up the majority of Tesla’s carbon footprint. Tesla’s Scope 1 (production emissions) and Scope 2 (emissions from purchased electricity and heat) totaled 610,000 metric tons of CO2 in 2022. Its Scope 3 emissions accounted for more than 30.1 million metric tons of CO2 the same year.The largest source of Tesla’s carbon emissions, accounting for 27% of the total in 2022, is the mining of metals and the manufacture of batteries. The aluminum that Tesla uses counts for 18% of its emissions, and the steel for 8%. Tesla scooped the remaining 47% of emissions into the category of “all others,” which includes downstream transportation and distribution, employee commuting and business travel, as well as the “use of sold products”—the actual driving of the cars—which produced 3.4 million metric tons of CO2 emissions.In Tesla’s battery supply chain, most emissions come from chemical processing of lithium, nickel and cobalt, with mining extraction and transportation making up smaller portions.While EV supply chains currently produce more emissions than the supply chains of gas-powered vehicles, the lifetime emissions of conventional cars are much higher, as they continues to burn gasoline for throughout their average lifespan of 17 years. An EV, though, will produce 55 tons less of CO2 emissions in its lifetime, according to Tesla’s calculations. And as more of the world’s manufacturing processes electrify, Tesla’s Scope 3 emissions will drop as well.More from QuartzThe world’s biggest banknote printer said the demand for cash hit a two-decade lowEvery fifth car sold worldwide this year will be electricClick here to read the full article.","May 4, 2023 at 11:25 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-finally-disclosing-full-extent-162500217.html,Quartz,0.175,0.775,0.11967418546365914,0.3359022556390977

On top of this, CME also owns other key assets related to foreign exchange trading & infrastructure and a strategic shareholding in Standard & Poor’s (S&P) Index business.The key driver of trading activity for CME is in its interest rate derivatives products, where it has an effective monopoly in the exchange trading of interest rate derivatives in the United States, with benchmark products across the entirety of the interest rate curve. Demand for interest rate derivatives is driven by volatility in interest rate markets, whose effect is compounded by the number of bonds held by those looking to manage interest rate risk and, by extension, market liquidity. The below chart of average daily volumes of interest rate derivatives and US Federal debt held by the public illustrates the extremely strong relationship the size of the US Treasury market and volumes growth, although there are deviations around this primarily around Fed intervention (for example, at the start of the pandemic, volumes were suppressed by an enormous amount of Quantitative Easing (QE) and effectively zero interest rates which reduced the demand for hedging products). We expect the growth in the size of the US Treasury market, particularly in relation to privately held US treasuries as the Fed undergoes a balance sheet unwind, to remain a powerful underpinning of CME’s interest rate derivatives business…” (Click here to read the full text)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 70On April 25, Credit Suisse lowered the price target of Block, Inc.

The 21.7% YoY growth was a result of card members spending more during the quarter and increased interest income with elevated average loan volumes.On March 8, American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) announced a 15% increase in its quarterly dividend to $0.60 per share. The other announcement was the commencement of a share repurchase program of nearly 120 million common shares.Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 91As per Insider Monkey’s database, the company has seen positive sentiment in Q4 2022 compared to the previous quarter as the number of hedge funds holding a stake in Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) increased to 91 in Q4 from 88 in Q3. Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investment Group was the most significant stakeholder as it increased its holding in the company by 179% to 7.5 million worth $926.2 million.“Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) was a negative contributor to performance due to our underweight position relative to Russell 1000 Growth Index, as the company had strong performance in Q1. The strength occurred after the company partially reversed a previously announced price cut for its electric vehicles following a period of strong demand. Tesla also reported better-than-expected results for Q4 2022 during the first quarter.Tesla Motors designs, develops, manufactures, and markets high-performance, technologically advanced electric cars and solar energy generation and energy storage products. Tesla sells more than five fully electric cars, among others, the Model X and Y SUVs, as well as the Model S sedan and Model 3 sedan. The company has a growing global network of Tesla Superchargers, which are industrial grade, high-speed vehicle chargers, typically placed along well-traveled routes and in and around dense city centers to allow Tesla owners quick and reliable charging. Tesla offers certain advanced driver assist systems under its Autopilot and Full Self-Driving options. US customers generate nearly half of Tesla’s sales.We see Tesla as the leading manufacturer of battery powered electric vehicles (EVs). The company has achieved scaled production of EVs before the other large automobile manufacturers. The company’s technology in battery production and self-driving technology is more mature than competitors’ offerings. EVs are one of the fastest growing categories within automobile manufacturing. The profit margin in the automotive segment is significantly above automotive competitors which provides the company flexibility to price its vehicles more strategically as the competition eventually scales up their EV production. The direct-to-consumer sales model gives the company more control over its relationship with its customers as well as a source of higher profit margin since there is no dealership share of the profits.”  Suggested articles:15 Best Dividend Stocks of 202310 Best Small Cap Defense Stocks to Buy Now12 Best Fast Growth Stocks to Buy Now","May 4, 2023 at 12:12 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-best-bitcoin-stocks-invest-171252169.html,Insider Monkey,1.0,0.3,0.14834837384837385,0.40220940170940156
TSLA,EV Players Are Speeding and Ramping Up Despite an Unfavorable Environment,"After receiving the manufacturing line earlier than expected in March, Worksport has now completed the installation of the equipment and is, therefore, able to begin training its staff. The training phase should take several weeks and it will be followed by numerous test runs. Worksport also began building the assembly line at its 220,000 square feet West Seneca, New York factory.When production begins, Worksport's hard-folding tonneau covers are expected to reach the market right away. Worksport will be providing an update on its newly redesigned portable COR HD advanced hot-swap battery system, which must be tested and completed before the solar-powered SOLIS cover becomes available for sale.Despite growing losses on the EV front, fleet and legacy operations have enabled Ford to top Wall Street estimates for its first quarter results. CFO described the reported quarter as being a “peek at what’s possible to generate value and growth”, only months after CEO Jim Farley admitted that last year, execution issues disabled Ford from capitalizing on $2 billion it made in additional profits. This time, Farley reported that Ford is making real progress on its Ford+ growth plan.Ramping up EV production came with widening operational losses as they increased from 2022 quarter’s $380 million to $722 million. Ford washed off its EV losses with its traditional automotive business named Ford Blue that earned $2.6 billion as well as Ford Pro fleet operations that earned $1.4 billion. Moreover, management stated that both businesses were profitable in every single region where they operate. This is the first time Ford is reporting results of its individual business segments.Earlier on Tuesday, Ford revealed that it will once more be slashing the starting prices of its EV, Mustang Mach-E, expecting on average $5,000 in build-cost reductions. These discounts will be aided by switching from lithium ion to lithium-iron phosphate batteries but Ford still needs to decide what will its EV identity be: growing fast at a cost like Tesla or prioritizing a cost discipline approach. Last month, Tesla’s CEO, Elon Musk, confirmed that it will be putting growth ahead of profits in this weakened macroeconomic climate. However, Tesla’s strategy also implies that its vehicles are expected to generate significant profit over the long haul due to autonomy. Even Tesla’s investors and supporters got worried after the latest quarterly report with Musk showing willingness to further sacrifice margins in exchange for market share, with some wondering is it truly a move to disrupt or one of desperation, but Musk assured that the aggressive price cuts are merely a short-term strategy while Tesla’s long-term margins remain protected.With the EV price war having kicked off into high gear and the macroeconomic fears of an upcoming recession beginning to materialize, investors will be up for many more nights, but Ford and General Motors continue going full speed ahead with Worksport getting the industry another step closer to an electric and greener future of transportation.DISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

(NASDAQ:MU) is a noteworthy stock of the engineering sector.“Inflation is still higher than interest rates… not an incentive to save for most people.

Exxon continues to invest in refining capacity in the US, which industrywide has been in steady decline since 2019.

TSLA,"'I Think People Can Make It On $999 Million,' Bernie Sanders Blasts America's Billionaires. Here Is How The Ultra-Rich Can Pay Less Income Tax Than Yo...","It’s no secret that U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders is not a fan of America’s billionaires.“Fine, yes, I think people can make it on $999 million,” he said. “I think that they can survive just fine.”Sanders emphasized that his view that billionaires shouldn’t exist does not constitute a personal attack on any specific billionaire.“It is an attack upon a system,” he said. “Do I think people who work hard, create new businesses should become rich? I do. Do I think they should have $50 billion or $100 billion when you have got a half a million people who are homeless in America today when you have 85 million people who can't afford health insurance? No, I don't.”Sanders argued that America should go back to “a very progressive tax policy like what we had under Dwight D. Eisenhower.”To be sure, the fairness of the U.S. tax system and whether the rich are paying their fair share has long been debated.According to a report from ProPublica, some billionaires in the U.S. paid little or no income tax relative to the vast amount of wealth they have accumulated over the years.The report noted that Amazon.com Inc. Founder Jeff Bezos “did not pay a penny in federal income taxes” in 2007 and 2011. It also pointed out that Tesla Inc. CEO Elon Musk paid no federal income tax in 2018 and investing legend George Soros did the same “three years in a row.”The reality is that billionaires build their wealth largely from assets. Their net worth goes up when these assets increase in value over time. But the U.S. tax system is not designed to capture the gains from assets: Capital gains are typically taxed at lower rates than wages and salaries.The good news? You don’t need to be in the three-comma club to invest in these assets.For many well-known billionaires, the bulk of their wealth is tied to the companies they helped create.Here’s the neat part: When stocks go up in value, investors only pay tax on realized gains. In other words, if investors don't sell anything, they don’t have to pay capital gains tax — even if their stock holdings have skyrocketed in value — because the gains are not realized.According to ProPublica, that’s why some billionaires choose to borrow against their assets instead of selling them. Doing so gives the ultra-wealthy money to spend while deferring taxes on capital gains indefinitely.That said, when they do sell their shares, they can still get hit with a substantial tax bill. After Musk sold a ton of Tesla shares in 2021, he tweeted that he would pay over $11 billion in taxes that year.Another popular option for billionaires is real estate, which comes with plenty of tax advantages as well.There’s also depreciation, which refers to the incremental loss of a property’s value as a result of wear and tear. Real estate investors can claim depreciation for many years and accumulate significant tax savings over time.Read next:Why Warren Buffett's Investing Strategy Is More Relevant Than Ever In Today's Real Estate MarketThis Fund Is Looking To Grant Moderate Returns If The Real Estate Market Doesn't Collapse – And Spectacular If It Does.© 2023 Benzinga.com.

TSLA,UPDATE 2-Ford CEO calls electric vehicle market price cuts 'a worrying trend',"(Adds Musk comment praising Ford strategy, paragraph 6)By David Shepardson and Joseph WhiteWASHINGTON, May 3 (Reuters) - Ford CEO Jim Farley said on Wednesday that price cuts in the electric vehicle market were ""a worrying trend"" after the U.S. automaker dropped prices for its Mustang Mach-E in response to a series of reductions by rival Tesla.Ford on Tuesday announced a price cut of up to 8% of its Mustang Mach-E electric vehicle, the second cut the automaker announced this year.Farley compared the price war in the EV market to Henry Ford's series of price cuts for the Model T starting in 1913. But the Ford Chief said the company founder's strategy ultimately put Ford at risk.""You do not want to commoditize the product,"" Farley said at a Wall Street Journal forum.""The resale value for people who bought at higher prices is awful.

TSLA,Ford vs. Tesla: The EV price war continues,"Tesla’s dramatic price cuts of its popular Model Y and Model 3 electric vehicles have upended the still nascent EV market. Though Tesla delivered a record number of cars in Q1, its margins sank as CEO Elon Musk decided to trade profits for increased market share and put the squeeze on competitors.Ford slashed the base model Select RWD standard range model by $3,000 to $42,995, among other big price cuts, including cutting the Premium RWD standard range by $4,000 to $46,995. The full list of cuts is listed below.Slashing prices comes as Ford is gearing up for the EV battle ahead — at the same time as it transitions its business from profitable gas-powered vehicles to an uncertain EV future. In its Q1 earnings report released Tuesday night (following the company’s announcement that it was “refounding,” which means it will now break out operating results across its traditional gas, EV, and commercial units), Ford revealed its Model e EV unit lost $722 million on an EBIT basis in the quarter.And that was before yesterday’s price cuts.“By 2025, we now expect there to be 45 EV models to be offered in the U.S. in the small-medium utility segment. It will be a very saturated two-row EV market,” Ford CEO Jim Farley said on the earnings call last night. “Against this backdrop, to ensure profitable growth, we know we have to have a fresh, compelling offering with the right cost structure, something we continue to improve with the Mustang Mach-E. We also found the customers are very loyal to full EV powertrains once they enter, but they are not brand loyal for their first purchase.”Compelling offerings with the right cost — and securing brand loyalty — are key to Ford’s success, according to Farley. And the company is willing to pay heavy up-front costs for it.Wall Street's reaction to Ford’s recent quarter and outlook projections was mixed.Wells Fargo analyst Colin Langan wrote in a note to clients that Ford reiterating its profit guidance, with a $10.0 billion midpoint in EBIT, actually represents a step down from its Q1 pace from last year and would be around a $500 million hit to earnings.

TSLA,Teslas Swelling Inventory Suggests Musk Will Keep Cutting Prices,"(Bloomberg) -- In the two weeks since Tesla alarmed investors by revealing how much of a toll discounts were taking on its profit margins, Elon Musk has bumped prices back up across the lineup.Most Read from BloombergZelenskiy Denies Ukraine Sent Drones to Hit Putin, KremlinNigeria Targeted a UK Mansion; Its Next Leader’s Son Now Owns ItCarl Icahn’s Wealth Plunges $10 Billion on Hindenburg Short-Seller ReportUS Looks Past India’s Rights Record as China Worries DeepenBanker Pay Surges For Those Willing to Work in Saudi ArabiaBut the April 20 increases on the Model S and X and this week’s tiny markups on the Model 3 and Y probably aren’t all-clear signals indicating Tesla’s pricing will stabilize for long. The dynamics that led the company to slash the costs of its vehicles the last few months — more supply than demand — appear to have stubbornly stuck around.Blogs that aggregate vehicle listings on Tesla’s website are finding that inventory has kept building — in the US, Europe and globally. @TroyTeslike, a Twitter user who counts many analysts and investors among his almost 110,000 followers, posted this week that Tesla has a backlog of around 72,000 orders, a fraction of the 476,000 he calculated as of late July last year.“Tesla is clearly transitioning from being supply constrained (where delivery volumes grow in line with production capacity and prices increase) to being demand constrained (where prices fall to stimulate demand and production outpaces delivery),” Toni Sacconaghi, a Bernstein analyst with a sell rating on the stock, wrote in a May 1 report.One of Tesla’s more bullish analysts has arrived at a similar conclusion. Alexander Potter of Piper Sandler just cut his price target to $280 — still the fourth-highest among analysts tracked by Bloomberg — to reflect his concern that the carmaker’s valuation might languish for a few months because of falling prices and margins.“Wait times haven’t spiked meaningfully, so Tesla may cut prices further,” Potter wrote this week, still maintaining his buy recommendation.Tesla has pulled some relatively inexpensive levers to try to perk up demand. Its order pages recently added a button promoting demo drives, and the company is now offering Model S and X buyers three years of free supercharging. Sacconaghi has speculated Tesla may start spending on advertising, or offer free trials of the features it calls Full Self-Driving to stoke adoption of the $15,000 driver-assistance system.The 15 days supply of vehicles in inventory that Tesla reported for the first quarter is relatively healthy by industry standards. But the way this figure has trended — it’s at the highest since the start of the pandemic, even after all the recent price cuts — isn’t encouraging. The closer the company gets to what’s considered the norm in the auto sector, the more its over $500 billion market capitalization is at risk of shrinking.Phillippe Houchois, an analyst at Jefferies who downgraded Tesla to a hold a week ago, warned it may end up looking more like the companies Musk has sought to disrupt than previously thought.“Autos’ structurally low returns may prevail over Tesla in the end,” Houchois wrote on April 26, cutting his price target by 20% to $185 and questioning how similar the company’s moves are to what Ford did with the Model T, or what Apple did with the iPhone.“It is harder to challenge a large established industry,” he wrote, “than create a new one.”Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekEurope’s ‘Golden Visa’ Programs Are Dying Out as Housing Costs RiseCadillac’s Lyriq EV Might Be a Winner If GM Can Build Enough of ThemThe Company Behind Ben Shapiro Is Trying to Build a Right-Wing Magic KingdomWhy Chinese Banks Aren’t Worried About Depositors FleeingA Tax Loophole Makes EV Leasing a No-Brainer in the US©2023 Bloomberg L.P.","May 3, 2023 at 8:30 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-swelling-inventory-suggests-musk-133006615.html,Bloomberg,-0.6,0.9,0.11241820195308566,0.38720426859961754
TSLA,Elon Musks price war pays off as Ford is forced to heavily cut EV prices to compete with discounted Teslas,"Elon Musk’s risky strategy of piling on one margin-eroding price cut after the other is already paying dividends—by ramping up the pain for Tesla’s competitors.The Detroit incumbent knocked off $3,000 from the base version, a cut of 6.5%, reducing its list price to $42,995.It went even further with the top-of-the-line GT Extended Range nameplate, slashing that by $4,000 to $59,995; at the start of the year, this car still cost nearly $10,000 more.Unfortunately for Ford CEO Jim Farley, his business cannot exactly afford it.First-quarter results published after the closing bell revealed ballooning losses at its EV division, dubbed “Model e,” on the back of spiraling costs.The $700 million deficit was so deep red the business actually managed to breach the ignominious mark of a negative 100% margin.That means that for each dollar in revenue Model e generated during the quarter through the sale of an EV, its operating loss went up by an equivalent amount.It was always expected that traditional car companies, lagging far behind Tesla, would not be profitable in the EV space anytime soon.But Ford's Model e quarterly financials were truly dire. By comparison, Tesla's operating profits weighed in at an extremely robust 11.4% return for the period despite heavily discounting its models this year.This allows Musk to further dial up the pain without swinging to a loss.“As many carmakers are working through challenges with the unit economics of their EV programs, we aim to leverage our position as a cost leader,” it said.A race to the bottom where Tesla would be the last man standing, in other words.“Tesla has triggered a price war in EVs that will have industrywide consequences: Legacy OEMs [original equipment manufacturers] will have to follow, but with higher cost structures,“ UBS wrote ahead of Ford’s earnings on Tuesday, designating Tesla and Ford as one of its top and bottom picks in the sector, respectively.Typically the best way for Ford to improve its EV results in the face of headwinds such as sweeping price cuts is through higher volume.Regardless of powertrain technology, the fixed-cost-heavy car business is all about scale—the more units of a particular model you sell, the faster profit growth should accelerate, a term generally referred to as operating leverage.Yet Ford’s EV lineup currently suffers from one major problem that throws a serious monkey wrench into that equation.Its variable costs, such as the raw materials like steel used to build a car, actually exceed the overall revenue generated with each electric vehicle it sells at present.As a result of this negative “contribution margin,” its losses actually worsen the more Mustang Mach-Es and F-150 Lightnings that Ford delivers to customers.These poor unit economics that Tesla alluded to late last month means Ford is in effect buying market share at a steep cost to its income statement.Speaking to investors on Tuesday, Ford boss Farley held out hope this wouldn’t remain the case much longer even if overall losses at Model e continue, owing to investment in the business.“We’re on track this year toward a contribution margin approaching breakeven in the Model e,” the CEO said.","May 3, 2023 at 9:23 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/elon-musk-price-war-pays-142312556.html,Fortune,-0.25,0.35,0.009023132664437019,0.4129319955406912

TSLA,Bid to Launch ETFs That Aim to Double Teslas Famous Volatility Filed With SEC,"(Bloomberg) -- A long-shot bid to launch double-leveraged, single-stock exchange-traded funds tracking the notoriously volatile Tesla Inc. has been filed with US regulators after past attempts have failed.Most Read from BloombergNigeria Targeted a UK Mansion; Its Next Leader’s Son Now Owns ItCarl Icahn’s Wealth Plunges $10 Billion on Hindenburg Short-Seller ReportWall Street Rattled by 15% Tumble in Pair of Banks: Markets WrapIBM to Pause Hiring for Jobs That AI Could DoRegional Bank Shares Plunge on Fear of More Rescues to ComeThe T-Rex 2X Long Tesla Daily Target ETF would trade under the ticker TSLT and use derivatives to track twice the daily returns of Elon Musk’s electric-vehicle maker, according to a Tuesday filing. Its sister fund, the T-Rex 2X Inverse Tesla Daily Target ETF, would trade under the ticker TSLZ and follow the reverse performance of Tesla stock by the same magnitude.If launched, TSLT and TSLZ would be the first double-leveraged Tesla-focused single-stock ETFs to trade in the US market. Previous attempts ended up lowering the leverage amount during the regulatory review, Bloomberg reported last year. So far, the highest leverage available on a single-stock Tesla fund is 1.5 times.“We think we have figured out a way to get to 2x, but if asked to dial back, it would just depend on how much,” Matthew Tuttle of Tuttle Capital Management, which along with REX Shares applied to create the ETFs, said in an email.We “want to be different than what’s out there — launching the exact same thing doesn’t seem to make a ton of sense,” said Tuttle, who is behind ETFs that short Cathie Wood’s equity bets and follow CNBC anchor Jim Cramer’s stock picks.In addition to the Tesla ETFs, Tuttle and REX Shares also applied for funds that track the performance of chipmaker Nvidia Corp. — the T-Rex 2x Long Nvidia Daily Target ETF and the T-Rex 2x Inverse Nvidia Daily Target ETF.All four ETFs would carry a 1.05% management fee.Leveraged single-stock ETFs debuted last year, even as US Securities and Exchange Commission officials sounded the alarm. SEC Chair Gary Gensler said the products “present particular risk,” while Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw called for the agency to adopt new rules that would address potential dangers.Even still, nearly 30 US single-stock funds have launched since last July. Of the roughly $900 million in assets, the bulk of that haul is sitting in ETFs tied to Tesla thanks to the stock’s unique volatility. On any given day, the carmaker reigns as the most-actively traded stock in the US, while Tesla’s 90-day volatility clocks in at about 71%.Yet previous applications for 2x-type funds were likely set to break SEC volatility rules and may have been dialed down for that reason. The regulator asks that a fund’s value-at-risk, or VaR — a risk-assessment measure — to not exceed 20% of the value of its net assets.It’s not immediately clear how Tuttle’s proposed ETFs would manage to comply with the rules.“I would be surprised if the Tesla 2x ETF gets approved,” said Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst James Seyffart. “I can’t imagine them approving this after denying this exact level of leverage in the past, even if TSLA’s volatility has decreased somewhat.”Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekWhy Chinese Banks Aren’t Worried About Depositors FleeingEurope’s ‘Golden Visa’ Programs Are Dying Out as Housing Costs RiseA Tax Loophole Makes EV Leasing a No-Brainer in the USWomen Chief US Economists Have Gotten Even Rarer on Wall StreetMore Companies Head to Space, But No One Can Agree on the Rules Up There©2023 Bloomberg L.P.","May 2, 2023 at 2:58 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bid-launch-etfs-aim-double-195827222.html,Bloomberg,0.13333333333333333,0.5333333333333333,0.03700300881151945,0.3378035675908016
TSLA,UPDATE 1-White House says Toyota 'fully committed' to electrifying auto fleet,"(Adds more quotes)By David ShepardsonWASHINGTON, May 2 (Reuters) -White House senior adviser John Podesta said Toyota Motor Corp ""had been the laggard"" on producing electric vehicles but is now ""fully committed"" after he met recently with senior company officials at the Japanese automaker.""I think they're going to stick with plug-in hybrids for a while, maybe longer than some of the other companies but they're fully now committed under their new leadership to electrification,"" Podesta told Reuters reporters and editors in a roundtable meeting on Tuesday.He met with Toyota Research Institute CEO Gill Pratt and Toyota North America chief administrative officer Christopher Reynolds.Last month, Toyota said it would introduce 10 new battery-powered models and target sales of 1.5 million EVs a year by 2026.Toyota, including its Lexus luxury brand, now has just three battery models on the market and last year sold fewer than 25,000 of them worldwide.Investors and environmental groupshave criticized Toyota as slower to embrace battery-powered cars than Tesla and others.Toyota in August said it would boost its planned investment in a planned North Carolina battery plant from $1.29 billion to $3.8 billion.Last month, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency proposed sweeping emissions cuts for new cars and trucks through 2032. EPA estimates 67% of new vehicle sales by then will be EVs.The Biden administration has repeatedly declined to endorse setting a firm date to phase out gasoline-only vehicles as California has done. ""I don't think we think that's necessary at this point,"" Podesta said Tuesday.White House infrastructure adviser Mitch Landrieu and Podesta met with Tesla CEO Elon Musk in January. Landrieu said in the joint Reuters interview with Podesta the administration had constructive conversations with Musk on EVs.""They're a key player. They were the first ones out there,"" Landrieu said. ""They were very open and workable and they've been a great partner.""Biden committed to building a U.S. network of 500,000 EV charging stations by 2030 using $7.5 billion in infrastructure funds.""We got (Tesla)...to open up their networkwhich took us much closer and much faster to the eventual goal of building the spine of EV charging stations.

TSLA,Ford cuts prices on Mach E as Tesla raises them on Model Y,"DETROIT (AP) — Ford is cutting U.S. starting prices on its Mustang Mach E electric SUV, bringing many versions below the cost of its main competitor, the Tesla Model Y.Ford also said it is reopening the order bank on Wednesday for the Mach E after upgrading a factory in Mexico to increase output.Also on Tuesday, Tesla raised prices by $250 on the Model Y SUV and the Model 3 small sedan, its two top-selling vehicles.The standard range base versions of the Mach E each saw $3,000 price cuts, with the rear-wheel-drive version falling to $42,995 and the all-wheel-drive model going to $45,995. Ford cut $4,000 off prices of the premium standard-range versions, with rear-wheel-drive dropping to $46,995 and all-wheel-drive going to $49,995.The price of the GT all-wheel-drive extended range version also fell by $4,000 to $59,995.By comparison, Tesla's Model Y dual motor now starts at $47,240, while the Y Long Range rises to $50,240, and the Y Performance version starts at $54,240. All have all-wheel-drive.The Mach E only is eligible for a $3,750 U.S. federal tax credit this year, while the two top-selling Tesla models are eligible for $7,500.Shares of Ford fell 2.7% in trading Tuesday morning, while Tesla shares were up slightly.Ford said in a statement that it was ramping up production of the Mach E in Cuautitlan, Mexico, to reduce customer wait times and use lower costs to cut prices.The company said in March it would increase Mach E production to an annual rate of 210,000 by year’s end. On Wednesday, the company said plant upgrades had been finished and would support a production ramp-up in the second half of the year.Tesla has cut U.S. prices four times this year, raising concern among investors about the company's profit margins.

TSLA,UPDATE 3-Ford cuts prices of Mustang Mach-E after Tesla moves,"(Adds comment from earnings call, Tesla CEO comment)By David ShepardsonWASHINGTON, May 2 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co is cutting prices on its Mustang Mach-E electric vehicle and reopening orders, the No. 2 U.S. automaker said on Tuesday, the second time has reduced prices this year after a series of price cuts by rival Tesla Inc.Ford said it is also increasing the range for standard-range battery models as it increases production of the electric crossover SUV in the second half of the year.Prices for most Mach-E models were cut by $3,000 or $4,000 depending on the version or by as much as 7.8%, Ford said. The price of the Mach-E Premium rear-wheel drive version is dropping from $50,995 to $46,995.Ford CEO Jim Farley told analysts Ford does not intend to pursue EV sales volume ""at any cost.... ""We are not going to price just to gain market share.""Farley's stance contrasts with Tesla CEO Elon Musk's statement last month that Tesla could cut profit margins on vehicle sales to zero and make up the difference through sales of software-enabled services.Ford shares closed down 2.2% at $11.80 Tuesday and fell 1.5% in after-hours trading after it reported first quarter earnings.Last month, the federal EV tax credit for the Mach-E fell by half to $3,750 from $7,500 after new battery sourcing requirements took effect.Mustang Mach-E U.S. sales fell 20% in the first three months of the year. Ford said Tuesday shipments of the Mustang Mach-E were limited in the first three months of the year to make industrial changes that will nearly double manufacturing capacity.In January, Ford cut prices of the Mustang Mach-E by as much as $5,900 per vehicle after hiking prices in August by $3,000 to around $8,000, citing supply-chain issues and higher material costs.Ford said all standard-range models will now be powered by lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries, which allows vehicles to gain an additional 45 units of horsepower and improves the targeted EPA range estimates.On Monday, Tesla raised prices in a range of up to $290 in Canada, China, Japan and the United States after the company had slashed prices on its top-selling vehicles since the start of the year.The hike was Tesla's first on its two top-selling models at the same time in multiple markets, although prices across its lineup are much lower than in January, after a round of discounts.

EG Corp., a Korean iron oxide manufacturer which supplies to ferrite core makers across Asia, also jumped by the daily limit. CQV Co. and Union Materials Corp. also soared.The surge comes amid growing speculation that ferrite is the most likely candidate to replace rare earths in Tesla’s electric vehicles, following a surprise announcement by the EV maker early March. The sector got an added boost as South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol met with Elon Musk in the US late last month, where the two discussed potential business cooperation.Read: Tesla Comments Spur Plunge in China Rare-Earth Miner Shares“Stock prices are rising on expectations that Tesla is reviewing using ferrite instead of Chinese rare earths,” said Yoon Joonwon, a fund manager at DS Asset Management Co. “But the replacement is impossible in the short run and we don’t know if those companies will become a supplier of Tesla,” he added.Read: Tesla’s Vision of EVs Without Rare Earths Will Spur Magnet RaceA March note by research firm Adamas Intelligence said “it’s a proven concept” that ferrite may replace rare earths for Tesla.

TSLA,"In race for efficient EVs, Mercedes taps F1 team to keep up with Tesla","By Nick CareyBRIXWORTH, England (Reuters) - Mercedes-Benz has plugged its Formula One team into the engineering process to build vastly more efficient mass-market electric vehicles (EVs), slashing development times by a quarter or more as it jump starts efforts to keep pace with Tesla.F1 technology has always eventually bled over into mass-market vehicles. But Mercedes' F1 collaboration to build more efficient EVs faster is unprecedented because it embeds that racing mindset and technological expertise directly in product development.After decades of leadership in combustion-engine technology, legacy carmakers like Mercedes have lagged Tesla in electric vehicles. Mercedes' F1 team can help it get back in the race, said Steven Merkt, head of transportation solutions at TE Connectivity, a major autos supplier.""Nobody feels the pressure more than Mercedes to be innovation leaders here,"" Merkt said. ""They've got to push it out or they're no longer Mercedes.""Last year, Mercedes unveiled its EQXX concept car, a super-efficient EV capable of a range of more than 1,200 km (745 miles), which was jointly developed with the German premium carmaker's F1 team in England.The EQXX took just 18 months to develop, leaning on the F1 team's experience of working rapidly to squeeze efficiency from engines and electric motors, aerodynamics and rolling resistance, the company said.""We have an edge here with Formula One that others don't have,"" Mercedes Chief Technology Officer Markus Schaefer said. ""Tesla doesn't have it. Other teams don't have it.""Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.Speed is ever more important because newer entrants, above all Tesla, can develop or tweak models far more quickly than legacy carmakers. Fast-moving Chinese EV makers have cut development time to an average of 2.5 years and are launching innovative, cheaper models in Europe.The need for speed is coupled with a push among carmakers to make EVs more efficient and thereby reduce costs - by lowering weight, improving range, and using less battery materials already in short supply. Suppliers say efficiency is now baked into some EV contracts as carmakers seek to make their vehicles more affordable.""Efficiency is a key enabler to accelerate adoption of EVs globally,"" Schaefer said.Parts of what Mercedes learned from the EQXX will feature in a new EV platform that will go into production in 2024, including aerodynamic features, parts of the powertrain and the vehicle's software system.Schaefer said applying its F1 approach, Mercedes has cut new vehicle development time from an average of 58 months to go from the drawing board to mass production to ""the low 40s"".

TSLA,"FOCUS-In race for efficient EVs, Mercedes taps F1 team to keep up with Tesla","By Nick CareyBRIXWORTH, England, May 2 (Reuters) - Mercedes-Benz has plugged its Formula One team into the engineering process to build vastly more efficient mass-market electric vehicles (EVs), slashing development times by a quarter or more as it jump starts efforts to keep pace with Tesla.F1 technology has always eventually bled over into mass-market vehicles. But Mercedes' F1 collaboration to build more efficient EVs faster is unprecedented because it embeds that racing mindset and technological expertise directly in product development.After decades of leadership in combustion-engine technology, legacy carmakers like Mercedes have lagged Tesla in electric vehicles. Mercedes' F1 team can help it get back in the race, said Steven Merkt, head of transportation solutions at TE Connectivity, a major autos supplier.""Nobody feels the pressure more than Mercedes to be innovation leaders here,"" Merkt said. ""They've got to push it out or they're no longer Mercedes.""Last year, Mercedes unveiled its EQXX concept car, a super-efficient EV capable of a range of more than 1,200 km (745 miles), which was jointly developed with the German premium carmaker's F1 team in England.The EQXX took just 18 months to develop, leaning on the F1 team's experience of working rapidly to squeeze efficiency from engines and electric motors, aerodynamics and rolling resistance, the company said.""We have an edge here with Formula One that others don't have,"" Mercedes Chief Technology Officer Markus Schaefer said. ""Tesla doesn't have it. Other teams don't have it.""Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.Speed is ever more important because newer entrants, above all Tesla, can develop or tweak models far more quickly than legacy carmakers. Fast-moving Chinese EV makers have cut development time to an average of 2.5 years and are launching innovative, cheaper models in Europe.The need for speed is coupled with a push among carmakers to make EVs more efficient and thereby reduce costs - by lowering weight, improving range, and using less battery materials already in short supply. Suppliers say efficiency is now baked into some EV contracts as carmakers seek to make their vehicles more affordable.""Efficiency is a key enabler to accelerate adoption of EVs globally,"" Schaefer said.Parts of what Mercedes learned from the EQXX will feature in a new EV platform that will go into production in 2024, including aerodynamic features, parts of the powertrain and the vehicle's software system.Schaefer said applying its F1 approach, Mercedes has cut new vehicle development time from an average of 58 months to go from the drawing board to mass production to ""the low 40s"". For derivative models - similar models built using the same platform - the target is ""the low 30s"".The F1 engine team at Mercedes AMG High Performance Powertrains (HPP) in Brixworth in central England is now working on at least half a dozen new projects developing parts for mass-market Mercedes models - batteries, invertors and new generations of motors, Schaefer said.'READY FOR THE NEXT RACE'HPP advanced technology director Adam Allsopp said he took the call from Mercedes headquarters in Stuttgart that kickstarted the EQXX project standing in a former cowshed while on holiday on the Isle of Wight in August 2020.

TSLA,Chinese electric vehicle brands expand to global markets,"YOKOHAMA, Japan (AP) — Osamu Furukawa has driven lots of Japanese cars for his business converting classic gasoline-powered models to electric. But his favorite ride is an import: A battery-powered SUV from China’s BYD Auto.Furukawa said he ordered an ATTO 3 when it went on sale Jan. 31, for its user-friendly features and appealing price of 4.4 million yen ($33,000) — or about one-quarter less than a Tesla.“It’s perfect,” Furukawa said in his office in Yokohama, southwest of Tokyo.Other ambitious Chinese EV exporters include NIO, Geely Group’s Zeekr and Ora, a unit of SUV maker Great Wall Motors.Some compete on price. Others emphasize performance and features, putting pressure on Western and Japanese premium brands.NIO Inc., which has persuaded buyers in China to pay Tesla-level sticker prices of up to 555,000 yuan ($80,000), says its latest SUV goes on sale this year in Europe. The ES6 boasts voice-activated controls and a range of 610 kilometers (380 miles) on a charge.“We are very confident the ES6 will compete in this premium SUV market,” NIO’s founder and CEO, William Li, said in an interview at the Shanghai auto show.That was supported by multibillion-dollar subsidies from the ruling Communist Party, which is trying to make China a creator of clean energy and other technologies. That rattles U.S. and European leaders who see China as a strategic and industrial competitor.Chinese brands are “serious competition,” according to David Leah, an analyst for GlobalData.They have “more competitive battery technology” and can “achieve greater economies of scale,” Leah said in an email.“We have a lot of respect for the car companies in China,” Tesla CEO Elon Musk said in a Jan. 25 conference call with financial analysts. “They work the hardest and they work the smartest.”Chinese brands are developing EVs to compete without subsidies as Beijing shifts the burden to the industry by requiring them to earn credits for selling electrics. Prices start as low as 100,000 yuan ($14,500) for a compact SUV with a 400-kilometer (250-mile) range on one charge.“The Chinese are scary,” Tesla CFO Zachary Kirkhorn said on the analyst call.Geely’s Zeekr plans to launch an all-electric sedan and an SUV this year in the Netherlands and Sweden. Its mini-United Nations of Chinese and European designers is in Gothenberg, Sweden, adjacent to Volvo Cars, another Geely brand, while its factories are in China.“Our ambition is to be a key player in electrified mobility in Europe within this decade,” said Zeekr CEO Spiros Fotinos, a Toyota and Lexus veteran. With a “clear global ambition,” he said, ""we’re looking at the opportunities and right timing for other markets.”CEO Carlos Tavares of Stellantis, the parent company of Chrysler, Peugeot and FIAT, warned in January that Europe needs a strategy to compete with China's lower prices. European-made electrics cost 40% more than Chinese models, according to Tavares.“It’s a very bleak scenario,” Tavares told German magazine Automobilwoche. “But it doesn’t have to go that way.”BYD Auto’s exports quadrupled last year to 55,916 sedans, SUVs and hatchbacks. Most went to India, Thailand, Brazil and other developing markets. BYD announced a 1,000-vehicle sale last year to Mexico's VEMO for the biggest EV taxi fleet outside China.State-owned BAIC, headquartered in Beijing, said a dealer in Jordan ordered 1,000 units of its compact EU5 sedan in January. The company said it plans to launch two to three more electric vehicles in Latin America, Southeast Asia and Europe.What about the United States, the biggest, richest market?“This is not an easy task,"" said NIO's Li. “Our products and services need to be prepared.""BYD Auto has been in the U.S. market for a decade selling battery-powered transit buses assembled at a factory northeast of Los Angeles. It is “still in the process” of deciding whether to sell SUVs and sedans to Americans, the company said in a written response to questions.Political tensions “make it difficult for a Chinese company to launch, EV or otherwise,” in the United States, Leah said.“This is a second or third car for a household. It can be used by a wife or daughter to commute to work, to go out with friends or to go shopping,” said Ora's deputy general manager, Tan Jian.In Europe, BYD Auto has partnerships with dealership chains in Britain, Sweden, Germany and the Netherlands. The company says it also has delivered cars in Belgium, Denmark and Austria. It has a deal with European rental company SIXT that BYD says will lead to sales of up to 100,000 vehicles over the next six years.In Japan, BYD Auto plans to have 100 showrooms by the end of 2025. Its Dolphin hatchback and Seal sedan are due to hit the Japanese market this year. The company says it also has exported some 4,000 ATTO 3s to Australia.Furukawa's OZ Co. converts Volkswagen Beetles and other classic models by replacing gasoline engines with batteries and electric motors. Furukawa said he drives his ATTO 3 every day and has gone as far as Osaka, 400 kilometers (250 miles) away.BYD Auto’s Yokohama showroom, which opened Feb. 2, is surrounded by dealerships for established brands including Toyota, Nissan, BMW, Volkswagen and Chevrolet.A married father of one said he looked at Japanese models but bought an ATTO 3 for its roominess and price.“I like the ride, and it’s easy to drive,” said the buyer, who asked to be identified only by his surname, Ohta. “There are so many good features.”Ohta’s father had a “negative reaction” about BYD being from China, which has a history of strained relations with Japan. But Ohta said his job in the electronic games industry has taught him to respect Chinese innovation.“They are coming out with excellent products,” Ohta said. “I have respect for the nation.”___McDonald reported from Shanghai.","May 1, 2023 at 9:21 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chinese-electric-vehicle-brands-expand-022126143.html,AP Finance,0.0,0.0,0.12230282738095238,0.38063616071428574

BABA,Alibaba logistics arm eyes up to $2 billion Hong Kong IPO -sources,"By Scott Murdoch and Julie ZhuSYDNEY/HONG KONG (Reuters) -Alibaba's logistics arm aims to raise up to $2 billion via a listing in Hong Kong likely early next year, sources with knowledge of the matter said, bolstering hopes for a capital markets revival in the Asian financial hub.Cainiao Network Technology's initial public offering (IPO) plan comes after Alibaba flagged in late March it would split its business into six units and that most of them would explore capital raisings or market debuts to help fund future growth.Cainiao, which has started work on the IPO, is looking to raise between $1 billion and $2 billion in Hong Kong, according to three sources. They declined to be named because the listing deliberations are private.The planned IPO, the size of which has not been reported before, is likely to be launched in early 2024, two of the sources said.The sources cautioned that the plans are not finalised yet and remain subject to changes.Cainiao said it would not comment on market speculation.Alibaba did not respond to a request for comment.Alibaba, which acts as a massive online marketplace for buyers and sellers, has in past years picked up stakes in top express delivery players to ensure reliable services for the group.It co-founded Cainiao in 2013 with partners including department store owner Intime Group, conglomerate Fosun Group and a handful of logistic firms. Alibaba took control of Cainiao four years later and has lifted its stake to 67% from 47%.Cainiao, which provides software and shares data with warehouses, carriers and logistics firms, reported 42 billion yuan ($6.07 billion) in revenue in the nine months ended December, up 22% year-on-year and accounting for 6% of Alibaba's total revenue.The logistics arm's IPO plan is the first of the expected capital raisings for Alibaba's spun-off units to be reported publicly as it pursues the biggest restructuring in its 24-year history.Analysts have said that the breakup could ease scrutiny over Chinese billionaire Jack Ma's sprawling business empire, which has been a target of local regulators as part of a broader crackdown on private enterprises since late 2020.The other five units include Cloud Intelligence, Taobao Tmall Commerce, Local Services, Global Digital Commerce and Digital Media and Entertainment.IPO PROSPECTSDealmakers hope that Cainiao's potential IPO, expected to be followed by market debuts from some of the other Alibaba units in the near-term, could help revive sluggish fundraising activities in Hong Kong.While Alibaba has not divulged potential listing venues for the other units, bankers say that Hong Kong would be a preferred destination because of its proximity to the group's home market and Sino-U.S. tensions.About $1.5 billion has been raised from IPOs in Hong Kong so far this year, marginally above the $1.2 billion raised in the same period last year, according to Refinitiv data.Craig Coben, the former head of Bank of America's Asia-Pacific capital markets business, said the Alibaba spin-offs would be on the radar of major global investors.""There will be international demand for these assets, although valuation may be a challenge given the losses that global investors have suffered from high-growth Chinese stocks,"" he said.($1 = 6.9149 Chinese yuan renminbi)(Reporting by Scott Murdoch in Sydney and Julie Zhu in Hong Kong; Editing by Sumeet Chatterjee and Jamie Freed)","May 7, 2023 at 10:30 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alibaba-logistics-arm-eyes-2-033018024.html,Reuters,0.0,0.0,0.0004528985507246397,0.3003623188405797

Just a short while after the token’s launch, one whale had over $1 million in PEPE, which was made with just a small initial investment of 0.19 ETH (about $385).

BABA,Alibabas Global Online Commerce Arm Weighs a US IPO,"(Bloomberg) -- Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.’s international online shopping unit is exploring a US initial public offering as it weighs options to spur growth for the business that includes major e-commerce brands Lazada and AliExpress.Most Read from BloombergTexas Mass Shooting’s Bloody Images Add to Fervor in Gun DebatePowell’s Bet Against Recession Looks Good — Minus the Credit Crunch and a DC StandoffFootball Stadiums Belong in the SuburbsBiden Trails Trump as His Approval Rating Hits Low in ABC PollSingapore’s Soaring Rents Are Becoming a Political ProblemThe firm is in the early stages of consideration and the IPO’s size has yet to be determined, according to people familiar with the matter. The business group is in talks with banks that could potentially help prepare for the IPO next year, said one of the people, who asked not to be named as the matter is private. Alibaba’s US-listed shares rose 1.2% in New York trading.The unit, which competes with rivals such as Amazon.com Inc. in markets outside China, is one of six parts that Alibaba is splitting into. Valuations for the international business units vary: Morgan Stanley in March priced “international retail” units including Lazada and Trendyol at roughly $29 billion, while a CICC analyst report from the same month valued the firm’s international division at about $39 billion.In recent quarters however, growth has been volatile in the face of global recessionary fears. Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Catherine Lim and Trini Tan estimated the unit could be worth at least $19 billion provided it cut costs.If it goes ahead, the Alibaba unit would join a number of high-profile Chinese firms including fast-fashion leader Shein seeking to tap American capital even as tensions rise between the world’s two largest economies. A listing in the US could help the business — — formally Alibaba International Digital Commerce Group, or IDCG — attract global investors wary of putting money directly into China.Alibaba in March unveiled plans to break up its empire into units such as e-commerce, logistics and the cloud, with each business potentially exploring fundraising and an IPO at an appropriate time. The company will consider gradually giving up control of some of the businesses, Chief Executive Officer Daniel Zhang said at the time, but declined to specify a timeline for any IPOs.IDCG includes Southeast Asian online mall Lazada; AliExpress, popular in Russia, Latin America and parts of Europe; Trendyol in Turkey; Daraz in South Asia and business-to-business marketplace Alibaba.com. In the final three months of 2022, the combined orders of Lazada, AliExpress, Trendyol and Daraz grew 3% from a year earlier, led by Trendyol. The international unit accounted for roughly $9.5 billion or 7% of Alibaba’s revenue in the last fiscal year and is headed by Jiang Fan, the former president of Alibaba’s domestic online retail businesses Taobao and Tmall.Other parts of Alibaba’s empire have already begun moving ahead with spinoffs. Cainiao Network Technology Co., the logistics arm of Alibaba, as well as Freshippo, its grocery chain, have started preparations with banks for IPOs in Hong Kong.Deliberations around an IPO are very preliminary and the situation may change, the people said. IDCG said in response to queries from Bloomberg that currently, there is no IPO plan.Alibaba has in the past explored splitting off Lazada. The unit, bought in stages from Rocket Internet SE, is considered one of the Chinese firm’s most high-profile international brands. It competes with Amazon and Sea Ltd.’s Shopee in Southeast Asian markets such as Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore.In 2022, Alibaba discussed raising at least $1 billion for Lazada before calling off negotiations with potential investors when talks bogged down over its valuation. It had aimed to secure the funding as a precursor to a spinoff. Alibaba has since mothballed the fundraising and injected additional funds into the company instead.--With assistance from Olivia Poh, Adrian Leung, Sarah Zheng, Jane Zhang and Edwin Chan.(Updates with Bloomberg Intelligence valuation estimate in fourth paragraph)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekWhy Launch Rockets When You Can Just Fling Them Into Space?Even $500 Million a Year From Google Isn’t Enough to Save FirefoxBiden Administration Tamps Down Talk of US-China DecouplingAirbus Bets on a Stretched A220 Jet to Beat Boeing’s 737Data Science Is the Hot New Master’s at B-Schools©2023 Bloomberg L.P.","May 4, 2023 at 7:06 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alibaba-global-online-commerce-arm-102538630.html,Bloomberg,0.0,0.0,0.026074147269799435,0.32637973942321763

Alibaba also owns the South China Morning Post.Meanwhile, average daily transactions at rival WeChat Pay, owned by Tencent Holdings, nearly tripled for transport-related spending during the first four days of this year's holiday compared with the same period in 2019, while the figure for hotel and tourist attractions jumped 93 per cent.The Alipay and WeChat Pay digital wallets account for more than 90 per cent of the mobile payments market in China and their data paints a broad picture of a consumer spending recovery in the world's second-largest economy.A total of 274 million people went on trips within the mainland during the holiday, 19 per cent more than the same period in 2019 before the pandemic hit, generating revenue of 148 billion yuan (US$21 billion), up 0.7 per cent, according to the Ministry of Culture and Tourism.China's outbound tours have recovered more slowly. Reservations for overseas flights at major online travel agency Qunar.com were 55 per cent lower during this year's holiday than in 2019, but bookings for outbound tours - including transport and accommodation - on Filggy, another popular travel site owned by Alibaba, soared tenfold compared to last year.Fliggy data showed that purchases of outbound tours during the Labour Day holiday more than tripled compared with the Lunar New Year holiday, even though the latter lasted for two more days.

BABA,Alibabas Faded Rally Signals Grim Outlook Ahead,"(Bloomberg) -- It took only four weeks for optimism around Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.’s breakup plan to fizzle. Restoring it will likely be an uphill battle.Most Read from BloombergNigeria Targeted a UK Mansion; Its Next Leader’s Son Now Owns ItWall Street Rattled by 15% Tumble in Pair of Banks: Markets WrapIBM to Pause Hiring for Jobs That AI Could DoCarl Icahn’s Wealth Plunges $10 Billion on Hindenburg Short-Seller ReportRegional Bank Shares Plunge on Fear of More Rescues to ComeAlibaba’s American Depositary Receipts are now 2.3% below where they were before the e-commerce firm announced its overhaul plan in late March, wiping out as much as 20% in gains. Investors had originally hoped that a split into six units would boost the empire’s value and increase chances of listing those units publicly, reversing woes faced after the sudden halt of Ant Group’s initial public offering in 2020 amid Beijing’s concerns about influence.But as US-China geopolitical tensions flare, some are starting to backtrack on their earlier enthusiasm. Concerns about broader weakness in sentiment for Chinese equities, coupled with questions about the potential initial public offering pipeline and a lack of growth catalysts, are also weighing on the stock’s outlook.“Whatever valuation gains from Alibaba spinning off and separately listing its business units may be tempered by the weak sentiment towards China because those IPOs will be harder to execute and valuations may be lower,” said Vey Sern Ling, managing director at Union Bancaire Privee.Alibaba’s post-spinoff fizzle in part also reflects a broader concern about the recovery trajectory in China’s economy. As a bellwether for the nation’s consumption patterns, analysts have revised its earnings forecast down by around 5% since March, according to Bloomberg-compiled data. Among concerns are a sky-high unemployment rate and decelerating private investment.The macro headwinds have made plans for IPO fundraising particularly difficult. Last week, the firm cut prices for its cloud services — a unit it aims to make public. The move suggests the firm is willing to cede more profits this year to keep business away from rivals like Tencent Holdings Ltd. Continued share sales by SoftBank Group Corp., an early and key investor, is also hurting prospects.There are some potential bright spots. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said last week that the stock remains its top pick in China’s Internet sector, citing a better product mix at its Taobao platform, artificial intelligence efforts, as well as a valuation recovery story, according to analysts including Ronald Keung. Alibaba now trades at its steepest-ever discount to net asset value, according to Goldman’s estimates.The stock remains in the red in both Hong Kong and US year-to-date, lagging behind rival Tencent, but still outperforming its e-commerce competitor JD.com Inc. and PDD Holdings Inc. Alibaba’s Hong Kong shares are trading at about 10 times forward one-year earnings, versus 12.3 times for JD.com and 19.3 for Tencent.Looking forward, analysts say that stronger fundamentals including steady revenue growth will be key to a revival.“Alibaba will likely struggle to revive its overall revenue growth with cloud alone and there is a limit to how much incremental profit you can get out of cutting costs/headcount,” said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Catherine Lim. “The firm needs to have a new growth catalyst for each of the other four businesses, excluding cost cutting moves, to support any premium valuation at the point of spinoff or IPO.”Tech Chart of the DayChegg Inc. tumbled as much as 48% on Tuesday, its biggest drop since November 2021, after the online educational services company warned that ChatGPT was threatening growth of its homework-help services.

BABA,These 2 Retail-Wholesale Stocks Could Beat Earnings: Why They Should Be on Your Radar,"Wall Street watches a company's quarterly report closely to understand as much as possible about its recent performance and what to expect going forward. Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.By taking the percentage difference between the $1.35 Most Accurate Estimate and the $1.30 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Alibaba has an Earnings ESP of 4.25%.Dick's Sporting Goods, which is readying to report earnings on May 24, 2023, sits at a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) right now. It's Most Accurate Estimate is currently $3.32 a share, and DKS is 23 days out from its next earnings report.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Dick's Sporting Goods is $3.18, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 4.43%.Because both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, BABA and DKS could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

Ma kept a low profile for several years and traveled overseas before returning to China recently.His appointment began Monday and runs through the end of October, the university said.Tokyo College, founded in 2019, connects the University of Tokyo with researchers and institutions abroad, including Collège de France.Its research focuses on themes such as the digital revolution, Japan viewed from within and outside, the humanities in 2050 and the value of life.Ma founded e-commerce firm Alibaba in the 1990s and was once China’s richest man.He is well known in Japan as a friend of Masayoshi Son, the founder and chief executive of SoftBank Group Corp.___","May 1, 2023 at 1:33 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alibabas-jack-ma-turns-japan-063352687.html,AP Finance,0.0,0.0,0.048437499999999994,0.26979166666666665

BABA,Jack Ma Joins University of Tokyo as Visiting Professor,"(Bloomberg) -- Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. co-founder Jack Ma is joining the University of Tokyo’s Tokyo College as a visiting professor, according to a profile page on the university’s website.Most Read from BloombergJPMorgan Ends First Republic’s Turmoil After FDIC SeizureBuffett Will Beat the Market as Recession Looms, Investors SayPeak Oil Spells Trouble for ConsumersRivian’s Troubles Don’t End at a 93% WipeoutJerome Powell Could Face More Opposition as Fed Choices Get TougherMa, 58, begins the new position on May 1 and is expected to contribute in several areas, the school said. He will provide advice on research topics and conduct research, especially in sustainable agriculture and food production; he will also give seminars about entrepreneurship and innovation.One of China’s most recognizable business leaders, Ma largely dropped out of public sight after he criticized Chinese regulators in 2020 and Ant Group Co., an Alibaba affiliate he also co-founded, had to pull its planned initial public offering. The billionaire resurfaced in Hangzhou, China in March, a rare appearance on the mainland.“It appears that his career as a businessman has come to a close,” said Oshadhi Kumarasiri, an analyst at LightStream Research who publishes on SmartKarma. “Although he achieved success in this field, he previously worked as an English teacher and had expressed a desire to return to teaching once he retired from his business ventures.”The Tokyo school did not detail what kind of lectures or seminars Ma would conduct. It wasn’t able to immediately respond to requests for further comment.Beijing’s move to halt Ant’s IPO kicked off a sweeping crackdown on China’s private sector, from real estate and education to gaming and the internet. Regulators sought to curtail the power of tech giants like Alibaba and Tencent Holdings Ltd., and pushed the focus of investments to strategic priorities such as semiconductors and artificial intelligence.Ma, once the highest-profile of China’s entrepreneurs, withdrew from the public spotlight. He was spotted in the Netherlands, Spain, Australia, Thailand and Japan.Chinese authorities made attempts to persuade Ma to return to the mainland and help showcase government support for the business community, Bloomberg News has reported. But Ma chose to stay overseas, saying he has retreated from his companies to focus on researching agriculture technology.Internally, Ma told Ant and Alibaba executives not to obsess over his return to China, stressing that he is committed to their success even at a distance, people familiar with the matter said.Then in March, Ma visited a school in Hangzhou to discuss topics — including ChatGPT — and said he hopes to resume his former job as a teacher someday. In April, he accepted a position as an honorary professor at the University of Hong Kong, although there were no plans for public lectures or speeches in that post.Ma has longstanding ties to Japan.

BABA,Alibaba Clouds Energy Expert Helps Companies Meet Emission Targets,"The Malaysian asset management and infrastructure company has used the tool to streamline its ESG strategies, and it plans to integrate Energy Expert into its own system.Below is a transcript of this conversation, edited for clarity and brevityTranscriptMore and more companies want to take responsibility for carbon emission reduction to contribute positively to the environment. Enterprises really adopt this as a core strategy in their global development.But, generally speaking, there is no end-to-end system or platform that could help them to reach this optimization rapidly.So, Alibaba Cloud provides out-of-the-box solutions, such as Carbon Vision, such as Energy Expert, to help companies save energy and manage their carbon footprint.In my current role, I lead a high-power team in setting ESG strategies and sustainability initiatives for our business and our offices all around the world.Because we are in the business of caring for assets, which includes buildings and infrastructure, we need to be mindful of our impact on the environment and what positive work we are doing to take care of the climate.So, our road map required us to calculate our Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissions. But this has always been a very manual process. And so this year, we wanted to look at ways to automate it. And hence, we made the decision to use Energy Expert.We are using the platform to count and measure our own emissions and carbon footprint. Now, using Energy Expert has helped us simplify the process, reduce errors, and prepare for a compliance exercise that we will be undertaking. And from a company ESG perspective, understanding the admission alone is just one-half of the job.Energy Expert has helped us simplify the process, reduce errors, and prepare for a compliance exercise that we will be undertakingWe need to have targets in place to reduce emissions. Energy Expert has got features that will allow us to do that. And so it has been very, very helpful in helping us implement our ESG strategy.From a client's perspective, we are going to be integrating Energy Expert into AssetTool, our own system. We're going to go out to our clients and give them the service for them to understand what their emission footprint is and what they can do to reduce that overall footprint.With support from a company like Alibaba, there will be a lot of knowledge sharing and creation.And that's something that I hope all of us here at UEM Edgenta will continue to enjoy and that many other companies out there will also experience.

BABA,Investors Heavily Search Alibaba Group Holding Limited (BABA): Here is What You Need to Know,"Over the past month, shares of this online retailer have returned -18.3%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry, which Alibaba falls in, has gained 6.4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Alibaba is expected to post earnings of $1.30 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +4%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -2.6%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.85 points to a change of -5.5% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -1.7%.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.20 indicates a change of +4.4% from what Alibaba is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1.4%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Alibaba.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Alibaba, the consensus sales estimate of $30.87 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -4.1%. The $127.73 billion and $142.64 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -4.2% and +11.7%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryAlibaba reported revenues of $35.92 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -5.6%. EPS of $2.79 for the same period compares with $2.65 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $35.36 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.57%. The EPS surprise was +21.83%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Alibaba is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Alibaba. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Alibaba Group Holding Limited (BABA) : Free Stock Analysis ReportTo read this article on Zacks.com click here.Zacks Investment Research","April 28, 2023 at 8:00 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-alibaba-group-130001398.html,Zacks,-0.13571428571428573,0.3214285714285714,0.10282738095238096,0.45018601190476176

BABA,10 Most Promising AI Stocks,"By now you are probably tired of constantly hearing and reading about the AI mania in the news. But if you are into investing and want to make money off of AI, you are in for a long, probably never-ending news cycle of AI since companies are just getting started in AI innovation and the coming years and decades will be full of opportunities and novel achievements by AI algorithms. A lot has been said about ChatGPT, chatbots, Microsoft’s integration of AI tools and Google’s AI plans. Let’s talk some numbers that quantify the real effects of the latest AI breakthroughs.The report shares several stats which show that the AI market, despite its dramatic growth, is still nascent. For example, the report cites stats from startup data platform Crunchbase, which show that despite the rapid advancement and numerous launches of AI companies over the past decade, AI startups account for just about 5% of new technology firms each year in the U.S.According to data from Burning Glass Technologies, an analytics software company, AI job postings as a share of all job postings quadruped in the past decade. However, those job additions still account for a tiny fraction in the U.S. labor market. In 2019, there were about 160,000 AI job postings in the United States, which was less than 10% of the 2 million total IT job postings, and only 0.7% of all job postings. Despite the excitement around accelerated AI adoption since the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the business world, both the total number of AI jobs and the share of AI job postings experienced a slight decline in 2020.Robots and automated devices will not be taking over the world anytime soon, but computer systems are being trained to analyze more like humans—but with greater speed and accuracy. They are programmed to handle such complex tasks as understanding natural language, visual perception, and speech and text recognition and translation.What the report didn’t foresee was who will take a lead in the AI race in the future. The report at the time mentioned the obvious names who were expected to gain market share in the AI industry. These included Alphabet Inc Class A (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft, Tesla, Facebook and Alibaba. The report specifically highlighted the advantage Alphabet Inc Class A (NASDAQ:GOOGL) had in the market. Quoting Josh Spencer, portfolio manager of Global Technology Equity Strategy, the report said:“Artificial intelligence will further advantage the massive players given a scarce talent pool and the importance of high-scale computing capacity and large proprietary data sets. It’s a matter of the strong getting stronger. AI is not typically the main reason we invest in these successful companies, but it’s becoming more important. AI is maybe 10% of the investment case at Google now, but it’s a very important 10%.”But who could have thought that a company named OpenAI would releases a tool five years down the road that would instantly threaten Alphabet Inc Class A (NASDAQ:GOOGL) core business model and force it to rethink its priorities, along with jolting major behemoths like Facebook.For this article we first listed down at least 30 companies that are working in the AI industry, providing AI-related software or hardware solutions or are investing resources in R&D related to AI. We then narrowed down our list to 10 companies whose analyst price targets are much higher than the current stock prices. The idea was to find promising AI stocks whose stock prices are poised to grow according to Wall Street analysts. The list is ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge fund investors, which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 943 hedge funds.Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 2Predictive Oncology Inc. (NASDAQ:POAI) uses AI-driven models for cancer treatment development. In March, Predictive Oncology Inc. (NASDAQ:POAI) posted results for the year ended December 31, 2022.Revenue in the period increased by about 6.3% year over year to total $1.51 million.As of the end of the last quarter of 2022, 2 hedge funds had stakes in Predictive Oncology Inc. (NASDAQ:POAI). Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investment Group owns a $27 million stake in Predictive Oncology Inc. (NASDAQ:POAI).Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 2Amesite Inc. (NASDAQ:AMST) uses AI to develop learning programs. Amesite Inc. (NASDAQ:AMST) has gained over 60% over the past 30 days through April 20. Most of the gains were courtesy of Amesite Inc. (NASDAQ:AMST)’s launch of its new learning platform that is enabled by GPT-4. The new platform provides the company’s customers with AI-assisted learning features.As of April 20 Amesite Inc. (NASDAQ:AMST) was trading at around $4.1. According to CNN Business, one analyst is covering the stock with a $40 price target, which shows a huge upside potential from the current levels.As of the end of the fourth quarter of 2022, 2 hedge funds had stakes in Amesite Inc. (NASDAQ:AMST).Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 40Chinese internet search giant Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) has been using AI in search, self-driving technologies and other platforms it operates for a long time. But Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) earlier this year rose after it was reported that the company was working on a ChatGPT-like service, called Ernie bot, and plans to integrate it with its platforms.However, Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) took a hit last month after the company cancelled its planned event to demo the Ernie bot. Nonetheless it remains one of the most promising AI stocks according to analysts.Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 99Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is rolling out a plethora of tools and features to integrate AI with its product suite. These include Generation AI, Adobe Firefly, new AI features for Adobe Lightroom and Adobe Sensei, the company’s AI and ML technology that operates across the Adobe platform, including Adobe Experience Cloud, Creative Cloud and Document Cloud.As of the end of the fourth quarter of 2022, 99 hedge funds had stakes in Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE). The total value of these stakes was $8.4 billion. The biggest stakeholder of the company is Terry Smith’s Fundsmith LLP which owns a $710 million stake in Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE).As of now, we believe Alphabet and Adobe are leaders in their own right in these areas and have a clear path to improving their existing offerings with AI advancements, which would allow them to be net beneficiaries of AI. There are also significant barriers to building leading AI offerings in these areas. As a result, our position sizes in Adobe and Alphabet remain sizeable. For Adobe, the status of its pending $20 billion-plus Figma acquisition is also uncertain. There is a good chance, in our view, that it will be blocked by regulators, which would mean the future opportunity to expand its offerings to the developer community (beyond designers) may not occur.”Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 113As of the end of the fourth quarter of 2022, 113 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), up from 105 hedge funds in the previous quarter.

BABA,Alibaba Cuts Cloud Prices to Spur Growth Before Possible IPO,"(Bloomberg) -- Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. is cutting the cost of its cloud services by as much as half, a move that could win users from rivals such as Tencent Holdings Ltd. at a time it’s considering spinning off the fast-growing Aliyun business.Most Read from BloombergTesla Drops Model Y Starting Price Below the Average US VehicleUK Blocks Microsoft’s $69 Billion Activision Deal Quants Are ‘Out of Ammo’ for Buying Stocks, Goldman WarnsFirst Republic Bank to Weigh Up to $100 Billion in Asset SalesBRICS Draws Membership Bids From 19 Nations Before SummitAlibaba and Tencent are vying to provide the raw computing power needed to train generative artificial intelligence models such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, which has ignited a global race. Core products of the Aliyun subsidiary will see 15% to 50% cuts from May 7, an Alibaba spokesperson said on Wednesday. The company has said it’s committed to expanding its cloud business, now led by group Chief Executive Officer Daniel Zhang, which it sees as a potential driver of exponential growth.Alibaba’s Tongyi Qianwen AI model, announced earlier this month, is already in demand by Chinese businesses. The Hangzhou-based company has received more than 200,000 requests from businesses to join its beta testing program, from industries as varied as fintech, electronics, transport, fashion and dairy farming. It sees the hand-in-hand provision of AI and cloud infrastructure services as a winning formula for wooing a large swath of the domestic market.“We are fully committed to working closely with our partners to develop customized, specialized AI models,” Zhang said in a statement.What Bloomberg Intelligence SaysAlibaba’s price cuts of up to 50% for its cloud services raise a risk that the unit’s adjusted Ebita in fiscal 2024 ending March will trail consensus expectations, even after a more than 5% decline in estimates over the past two weeks. The cuts raise the likelihood that Alibaba will cede 2024 cloud profit gains to spur revenue growth and fend off increased cloud and generative-AI rivalry from peers such as Tencent and Baidu this year.— Catherine Lim and Trini Tan, BI analystsFounded in 2009, Alibaba Cloud provides data processing and storage services to thousands of businesses, developers and government organizations in more than 200 countries and regions.

The letter said Alibaba opened two cloud data centers in Santa Clara, California, in 2015.Reuters reported in January 2022 that the Biden administration was reviewing the cloud business of e-commerce giant Alibaba to determine whether it poses a risk to U.S. national security.

BABA,JD.com Is Worst China Bet as Reopening Play Fades,"(Bloomberg) -- China’s post-Covid spending spree was supposed to reinvigorate JD.com Inc. But things haven’t gone according to plan.Most Read from BloombergTesla Drops Model Y Starting Price Below the Average US VehicleUS Economic Growth Slows to 1.1% While Inflation AcceleratesSingapore Hikes Property Tax, Doubling Rate on Foreigners to 60%Germany in Talks to Limit Export of Chip Chemicals to ChinaNetflix Spain Lost 1 Million Users Last Quarter, Kantar SaysAfter dropping 37% since the start of the year, JD.com trails all its peers in the benchmark Hang Seng Tech Index, as well as a gauge of Chinese shares traded in Hong Kong. A slow and uneven recovery from the Covid slump, in addition to growing competition from rivals PDD Holdings Inc. and ByteDance Ltd., has led the likes of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and UBS Group AG to cut their estimates.JD.com’s struggles are emblematic of the challenges faced by China’s online retailers. Demand for big-ticket items is still weak — bad news for a company which counts on electronics and home appliances for half its sales. The stock’s 77% gain from an October low to a January peak has all but vanished.“Investors dislike uncertainty and here we have uncertainty from a number of angles,” said Adam Montanaro, investment director of global emerging-markets equities at abrdn Plc. “The stock will likely remain in the penalty box until management can prove they can continue to evidence margin expansion and better evidence their competitive moat.”Signs of cracks in the shares’ rally started to appear in February amid reports that JD.com was rolling out a 10 billion-yuan ($1.5 billion) discount campaign to fend off a challenge from PDD’s budget shopping app Pinduoduo, which has years of experience in offering mass-scale subsidies.While JD.com has consistently excelled in value-added services such as delivery and after-sales support, it’s difficult for the company to beat Pinduoduo on price wars and promotions, according to Xiadong Bao, fund manager at Edmond de Rothschild Asset Management. “Visibility is low and investors prefer to wait before the company delivers on earnings,” Bao said.Grounds for optimism receded further in March when the company warned that a robust recovery in consumption is unlikely to materialize until the second half. China’s latest economic data reflect the uncertainties: while retail sales soared last month, industrial output growth is still below pre-pandemic rates and the nationwide urban jobless rate remains elevated.To make matters worse, investors were caught off guard this month by reports of organizational changes in JD.com’s logistics and retail arms — an overhaul that Barclays Plc analyst Jiong Shao expects to cause near-term business disruption. Another initiative to move some products to third-party merchants is set to hit sales in coming quarters, Shao wrote in a note.Analysts now expect the online retailer’s revenue growth to slow to 5.8% in 2023 from 10% in 2022, well below a projected gain of 28% for PDD. Their price targets have also been tumbling, with an average decline of more than 9% since March 24 the most among all Hang Seng Tech Index members.The pessimism is reflected in a valuation that at 12.6 times forward one-year earnings is the cheapest ever, although the stock is still pricier than China’s e-commerce bellwether Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.“The now lowly valuation suggests it could be an interesting time to add for patient investors,” said abrdn’s Montanaro.For now though, the stock appears to lack a near-term spark. JD.com is still readying its large language model for a launch later this year while rivals Baidu Inc. and Alibaba have had a head start on AI chatbots. Alibaba also is gaining attention with its plan to split its $250 billion empire into six business units.“Investors who want to do some rebalancing within the Chinese tech sector would choose to long Alibaba or Tencent, to bet on a sharper business turnaround,” said Kenny Wen, head of investment strategy at KGI Asia Ltd.Tech Chart of the DayTesla Inc. shares fell nearly 11% last week, wiping out about $63 billion in market capitalization and binging its value to the brink of slipping below $500 billion.

It ranked fourth among Chinese companies for global mobile gaming revenue last month, behind Tencent Holdings, NetEase and miHoYo, according to data from US app analytics firm Sensor Tower.Nuverse, which aims to create ""hardcore"" games that can generate steady revenue for the social media giant, laid off hundreds of employees from two studios in Shanghai and Hangzhou last year amid the industry's regulatory pressure.Late last year Bilibili doubled down on its gaming business, which once accounted for over 80 per cent of its total revenue before being eclipsed by video streaming.

BABA,Alibabas Grocery Arm Gears Up for Hong Kong IPO,"(Bloomberg) -- Freshippo, the Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. grocery chain known for selling cooked lobsters and grouper freshly chosen from fish-tanks in the store, has started preparations for a Hong Kong initial public offering, people familiar with the matter said.Most Read from BloombergAirline Blunder Sells $10,000 Asia-US Business Class Tickets for $300Tesla Slashes Prices of Key Models Again Ahead of EarningsWorthless Degrees Are Creating an Unemployable Generation in IndiaIndia Passes China as World’s Most Populous Nation, UN SaysDisney Is Set to Eliminate Thousands of Jobs Starting Next WeekThe company is working with banks including China International Capital Corp. and Morgan Stanley to help prepare for the first-time share sale of the unit, known in Chinese as Hema, the people said. The plan is still at an early stage and a listing might not happen until next year or later, said one of the people, who asked not to be identified as the information is private.The size of Freshippo’s IPO and its target valuation are still under consideration, the people said. In January 2022, Freshippo was considering raising funds at a valuation of $10 billion, people familiar with the matter said. Since then, valuations of privately-held companies globally have fallen as stocks plunged and investors shied away from riskier assets.Deliberations are ongoing and details of the IPO, including the final advisory lineup, could still change, according to the people. Alibaba may also decide not to proceed with a listing for Freshippo, they said. A spokesperson for Alibaba didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment, while representatives for CICC and Morgan Stanley declined to comment.Freshippo is among the first of several Alibaba units in the pipeline to be listed after the Chinese tech giant last month made a surprise announcement to split up its $250 billion business. The firm will be divided into six main units in sectors including e-commerce, media and cloud computing. Cainiao Network Technology Co., Alibaba’s $20 billion logistics arm, is set for an IPO as soon as the end of 2023, Bloomberg News reported.Alibaba fell about 2.1% on Wednesday in New York, tracking a broader decline across Chinese technology stocks. The company has a market value of around $242 billion.Freshippo offers a Sam’s Club-like supermarket experience that includes a dine-in restaurant as well as 30-minute home delivery. Its grocery brand Hema Xiansheng turned profitable in 2022, according to a company website citing an internal memo from Hema Chief Executive Officer Hou Yi.Started in 2016, Shanghai-headquartered Freshippo had more than 270 self-operated stores across China as of March 31, 2022, according to its website. It facilitates high-tech automatic order picking that transports goods via conveyors attached to the roof of the store, and uses robots to deliver food for its dine-in customers.The IPO plan “raises the odds that the money-losing supermarket unit can become profitable this fiscal year ending March 2024, boosting its earnings outlook,” Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Catherine Lim and Trini Tan wrote in a note on Wednesday. Freshippo could command higher valuations than peers such as Sun Art Retail Group Ltd., DingDong Cayman Ltd. and Missfresh Ltd., which is backed by another tech giant Tencent Holdings Ltd., they said.--With assistance from Jane Zhang.(Adds Alibaba’s shares in sixth paragraph and Bloomberg Intelligence analyst comments in last paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe Repo Man Returns as More Americans Fall Behind on Car PaymentsAmericans Go Deeper Into Debt as They Use Buy Now, Pay Later Apps for GroceriesRepublicans Fight a Solar Boom That’s Made Texas King of Clean EnergySan Jose Plans Robocar Network Instead of Airport ShuttleTikTok’s Algorithm Keeps Pushing Suicide to Vulnerable Kids©2023 Bloomberg L.P.","April 19, 2023 at 7:51 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alibaba-grocery-arm-gears-hong-005129563.html,Bloomberg,0.0,0.0,0.07620802620802622,0.32489762489762486

BABA,Amazon vs. Alibaba: Which Is a Better Value?,"Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) have a lot in common. They are both the largest e-commerce companies in their respective home countries, and both are industry leaders in Cloud computing. Both have benefited from a two-decade-long boom in digital transformation. Since October 2020 for Alibaba and December 2021 for Amazon, their stock prices have declined by 71% and 46%, respectively, putting them in what many would consider undervalued territory.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with AMZN. Click here to check it out. AMZN 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of AMZNPeter Lynch Chart of AMZNBoth stocks have suffered from declining e-commerce margins due to inflation and the weakening economy, and the Cloud business has also been growing slower than expected as companies watch their spending. The good news is, the global e-commerce industry is forecasted to grow at an 11.57% compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) and reach a value of $6.35 trillion by 2027, according to Statista. Therefore, I believe both stocks are set for a rebound. But, which one is the better value? Let's take a look.AmazonIn the fourth quarter of 2022, Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) revenue reached $149.2 billion, exceeding analysts' expectations by $3.43 billion and increasing by approximately 8.59% compared to the same period of the previous year. However, Amazon did see a $5 billion foreign exchange rate headwind, meaning that if revenue had been measured on a constant currency basis, the growth rate would have been higher at 12% year over year. While this growth rate is lower than the 14.7% growth seen in the third quarter of 2022, it was expected due to the current macroeconomic climate.International revenue plummeted by 8% year over year to $34.5 billion, not all of which can be blamed on foreign exchange headwinds. The good news is the U.S. dollar to Euro exchange rate has corrected down since October 2022.Another positive for Amazon is its Cloud busines, Amazon Web Services (AWS), has still continued to grow. Its revenue increased by 20% year over year in the fourth quarter to $21.4 billion. According to a study by Fortune Insights, the Cloud industry is forecast to grow at a rapid 19.9% CAGR and reach a value of $1.7 trillion by 2029.Moving on to profitability, Amazon reported operating income of $2.7 billion, which decreased by over 20% year over year. The only positive was operating income has increased from the $2.5 billion reported in the third quarter.Amazon has also made a number of layoffs across the company. In January 2023, CEO Andy Jassy announced plans to lay off 18,000 employees, and then in March, he announced a further 9,000 job cuts.This may seem like the act of a company that is going through tough times, but I think we need to keep perspective. If we zoom out, we see Amazon increased its number of employees by nearly double from ~800,000 at the end of 2019 to 1.6 million by the end of 2022. A lot of unecessary roles can end up being created in such a big company on such a huge hiring spree, so the job cuts may not necessarily impact the company's performance.A positive for Amazon is its free cash flow has started to improve. Its trailing 12-month FCF was -$23.5 billion in the second quarter of 2022. This was down substantially from the positive $31.9 billion reported in the same quarter of 2020. Things finally are beginning to look up as of the fourth quarter of 2022, as free cash flow improved to -$11.6 billion in the trailing 12 months. Therefore, moving forward, I expect cash flow to continue to improve, especially as Amazons capital expenditures have begun to level off.AlibabaSimilar to Amazon, Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) has reported slowing revenue growth due to macroeconomic factors. In the third quarter of its fiscal year 2023, Alibaba reported $35.9 billion in revenue, which increased by just 1% year over year. The main headwind against revenue growth was tepid consumer sentiment and the Covid lockdown policies in China.The good news is, after popular protests on the lockdowns, Chinas health ministry is reported to be reclassifying Covid-19 as a less deadly virus and the restrictions are now easing.In addition, the IMF forecasts GDP in China to grow by a rapid 5.3% in 2023. To put that into perspective, U.S. GDP is expected to be flat (and may even decline in 2023).Alibaba has also recently announced plans to split its business into multiple segments and potentially IPO each part. This could help to unlock shareholder value due to increased access to capital and faster decision making.Another positive for Alibaba is its China commerce business increased revenue by a solid 10% year over year to $10.79 billion. This was driven by strong growth of Alibabas telemedicine business, which offers virtual doctor visits and more. Given most things are online these days, it seems a surprise that health care is still so old-fashioned.Interestingly enough, Amazon has also been extremely bullish on telemedicine. In fact, in February 2023, Amazon closed a $3.8 billion deal to acquire One Medical. According to Grandview Research, the global telehealth market is forecast to grow at a rapid 24% CAGR up until 2030. Therefore, I suspect both Amazon and Alibaba will benefit.Unlike Amazon, Alibaba has recently announced substantial improvements in its profitability. The company reported $5.47 billion in operating income in the latest quarter, which increased by 7.89% year over year, while its earnings per share increased by an even greater 61%. This was driven by a variety of efficiency improvements across the organization, which included operating leverage gains across its sales and marketing expenses. This metric reduced from 15% of total revenue in the prior quarter to just 12% by the third quarter of fiscal 2023.Final thoughts Amazon and Alibaba are two tremendous and dominant e-commerce and Cloud companies. Both companies have faced a series of headwinds but look to be poised for a rebound in the long term. Alibaba is poised to benefit from the strong growth in Chinas economy (and its huge population), whereas Amazon can benefit from growth in emerging markets and a recovery in the U.S. Alibaba does have country risk for U.S. investors, which is worth keeping in mind. Amazon is thus the stock I prefer as I'd rather reduce my exposure to stocks that may be affected by politics. However, I think both stocks are a great value.","April 18, 2023 at 12:00 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-vs-alibaba-better-value-170016188.html,GuruFocus.com,0.5,0.5,0.09052584670231728,0.4050594177064765

BABA,Here is What to Know Beyond Why Alibaba Group Holding Limited (BABA) is a Trending Stock,"Shares of this online retailer have returned +15.8% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +5.7% change. The Zacks Internet - Commerce industry, to which Alibaba belongs, has gained 5.7% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Alibaba is expected to post earnings of $1.30 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +4%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -3.5%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.85 points to a change of -5.5% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -4.5%.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.20 indicates a change of +4.4% from what Alibaba is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -2.7%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Alibaba.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Alibaba, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $31.08 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -3.4%. For the current and next fiscal years, $127.73 billion and $142.64 billion estimates indicate -4.2% and +11.7% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryAlibaba reported revenues of $35.92 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -5.6%. EPS of $2.79 for the same period compares with $2.65 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $35.36 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.57%. The EPS surprise was +21.83%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Alibaba is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Alibaba. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Alibaba Group Holding Limited (BABA) : Free Stock Analysis ReportTo read this article on Zacks.com click here.Zacks Investment Research","April 17, 2023 at 8:00 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-beyond-why-alibaba-group-130001227.html,Zacks,-0.07142857142857142,0.14285714285714285,0.10643212508884152,0.4598791755508172
BABA,"The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights Microsoft, Alphabet, Baidu, Alibaba and Amazon","Chicago, IL – April 17, 2023 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL, Baidu BIDU, Alibaba BABA and Amazon AMZN.Here are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:However, one can not ignore the cloud giant — Amazon — when discussing AI and its future scope. The company, which was working on its language model and making concerted efforts to develop a ChatGPT rival all these days, has finally made its move in the generative AI battle.The company's cloud-computing arm, Amazon Web Services (AWS), unveiled an AI-powered solution — Amazon Bedrock. The solution is designed to accelerate the deployment of generative AI-backed foundation models (FM). Further, the company introduced its language model called Amazon Titan.Although the company has marked itself late in the race, its latest move holds the potential to take on the moat of Microsoft and pose a serious threat to the other tech behemoths mentioned above.It has taken the generative AI competition to another level. This positions Amazon well to capitalize on the growth prospects present in the market for this particular technology.According to a report from Allied Market Research, the generative AI market is expected to hit $126.5 billion by 2031, registering a CAGR of 32% between 2022 and 2032.Amazon is poised to make its big AI play on the heels of AWS strength and, more importantly, Bedrock capabilities.Amazon Bedrock provides seamless access to high-performing FMs from AI startups like AI21 Labs, Anthropic and Stability AI, among others, through an API. With these FMs, developers can build and scale their generative AI-based applications.Apart from the FMs from these startups, Bedrock also provides access to FMs of Amazon Titan, a ChatGPT rival from the e-commerce giant. Titan FMs can remove content from the data and user input and filter model outputs containing unwanted content. Moreover, customers will be able to customize Titan models with their own data.Titan Text, the LLM of Amazon Titan, handles tasks including summarization, text generation like creating blogs, open-ended question-answer and information extraction.Further, Amazon Titan comes with another LLM called Titan Embeddings, which translates text inputs into numerical representations containing the semantic meaning of the text.It can be concluded that Amazon, which carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Holds), has positioned itself well in the chatbot and generative AI race on the back of Bedrock and Titan.Microsoft, considered one of the major investors in OpenAI, is gaining significantly from the rapid deployment of ChatGPT.The Zacks Rank #3 company recently integrated OpenAI's next-generation LLM — GPT-4 — into its search engine Bing and its browser Edge to deliver a ChatGPT-like experience to the users.Meanwhile, Google is also making concerted efforts toward bolstering features of its recently launched chatbot, Bard, which is based on the Language Model for Dialogue Applications (LaMDA) and produces blocks of text instantly.Microsoft and Google are selling their underlying technologies through their cloud platforms to capture a huge market share.However, Amazon's offering of FMs from various AI startups as well as its own first-party language models to the developers, differentiates it from Microsoft and Google. Hence, Amazon's latest move poses a challenge to the latter two.Amazon's launch of Bedrock and Titan has also pepped up the battle for the China bigwigs – Baidu & Alibaba, which are also making solid endeavors to reap benefits from the booming generative AI market.Baidu, sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), launched its generative AI chatbot — Ernie Bot — which is capable of solving mathematics queries, responding to questions regarding Chinese literature and generating images and videos. The chatbot can generate audio in different Chinese dialects. Further, the company intends to integrate Ernie Bot into its search service.Alibaba, a Zacks Rank #3 company, recently introduced its LLM — Tongyi Qianwen — which is currently available for beta testing. The company has already opened registration for businesses to test Tongyi Qianwen's chatbot.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

BABA,Alibaba's AI Launch Puts These ETFs in Spotlight,"Alibaba Cloud — the cloud computing entity of the China-based multinational technology conglomerate Alibaba BABA — recently announced that it will be launching its product Tongyi Qianwen, an AI model similar to ChatGPT.Per an article published on CNBC, Tongyi Qianwen is set to command Chinese and English language capabilities. The cloud computing entity of Alibaba stated that the product would be available to its customers on the cloud, helping them build customized large language models in an economical way. The AI model is set to be integrated across Alibaba’s various businesses to improve user experience.Users can soon expect more gripping AI features such as image understanding and text-to-image in the Tongyi Qianwen model, as stated by Alibaba Cloud. Following the revelation of Chinese company Baidu’s BIDU own ChatGPT version, Ernie Bot, last month, Alibaba is the latest Chinese tech giant looking to enter in the AI domain.The tech conglomerate saw its share price rise right after the announcement, but the price was pulled back shortly. However, the future impact of the AI model on Alibaba’s business depends upon the Chinese cyberspace regulator, Cyberspace Administration of China (“CAC”). The cyberspace watchdog revealed draft measures early this week for administering AI generation services.As per a Reuters article, CAC stated that increased investments in emerging technology and its consumer popularity should be in line with China’s core socialist views. However, the country does encourage innovation and application of the AI technology. CAC stated that a penalty would be imposed on the providers if the guidelines of the regulator are not adhered to, facing the risk of having their services suspended or even undergoing a criminal investigation.In late March, Alibaba had announced a reorganization to split its business into six, which escalated the share price by nearly 14%. Many analysts believe that this decision by the tech conglomerate may result in a likely boost in valuation and help in safeguarding against regulations. However, this may come at the cost of economies of scale.

Chiles previously worked as a senior financial analyst for payment solutions provider Total System Services (NYSE:TSS) and has experience with ING Americas.In October 2021, Trump's newly formed media company, Trump Media & Technology Group, announced a deal to go public by merging with Digital World.

The company's VP-Treasurer, David Viney, will be the interim CFO until a replacement is found.Bank of America lowered the price target on Harley-Davidson stock to $55 from $65 but mentioned that the move reflects a broader role and compensation opportunity for Goetter and is not likely related to any issues at the company.Meanwhile, UBS noted that Harley-Davidson's Q1 retail sales in the U.S. may decline close to 20%, indicating a worsening retail environment, despite the company's offer of low-interest rates to borrowers.Cutera (NASDAQ:CUTR) shares dropped more than 28% on Wednesday after the company terminated both its Chairman and CEO, Daniel Plants and David Mowry, for cause. The decision followed joint and unanimous recommendations from a special committee comprising all members of the Board’s Governance and Corporate Responsibility Committee and the majority of the members of the Board of Directors.The company appointed Sheila Hopkins as Interim CEO and Janet Widmann as Independent Chair of the Board and is currently searching for a permanent CEO.Shares closed nearly 5% lower for the week.Alibaba (HK:9988) (NYSE:BABA) shares dropped nearly 6% on Wednesday after Financial Times reported that SoftBank (TYO:9984) intends to sell nearly its entire stake in China’s e-commerce giant, as it struggles with a severe rout in its technology investments.The reported impending sale, which comes after Softbank offloaded about $7.2 billion worth of Alibaba shares this year and a record $29B in 2022, will cut its share in Alibaba to just 3.8%.Shares closed nearly 8% lower for the week.Related ArticlesHedge funds and C-suites: Trump-backed Digital World nabs new CFO | Pro RecapUPS, Teamsters to open high-stakes US labor talksBaidu launches assisted driving system","April 17, 2023 at 1:26 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hedge-funds-c-suites-trump-062644636.html,Investing.com,0.06818181818181818,0.22727272727272727,0.08015772807439474,0.3536746432579766

BABA,SoftBank moves to sell almost all stake in Alibaba: Report,"Yahoo Finance Live anchors Julie Hyman and Brad Smith discuss reports that SoftBank is preparing to sell most of its Alibaba stake.[AUDIO LOGO]So kind of an interesting situation here, Brad, because you would think when a big shareholder sells a stake, even if it maybe wasn't a complete shock, that still it would be weighing on the shares. You see here it's really been a very gradual wind-down from a very large stake that SoftBank had in Alibaba of as much as 34% at the peak. Now, according to ""The Financial Times,"" that stake's going to go to 3.8%.SoftBank has had some troubles here. And it's been winding down a lot of holdings. So maybe it's because people are seeing it more as a referendum on SoftBank than on Alibaba. I don't know.And so, with that in mind, I think for Alibaba and this relationship with SoftBank, and even as SoftBank has sputtered on some of its own Vision Funds that they have been able to put together and amass billions of dollars, essentially, but has not necessarily seen the returns that some of the investors had looked for within that. This could be a broader referendum that not only is seen on SoftBank, but SoftBank perhaps just needing to liquidate some of its positions as well for operational perspective.The timing of this is also interesting. Alibaba just announcing it's going to do that split, right, into six different parts. And so maybe SoftBank judging that this is the time before that gets completed to wind this down even further.","April 13, 2023 at 8:36 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/softbank-moves-sell-almost-stake-133624703.html,Yahoo Finance Video,0.0,0.0,0.20824079302340176,0.4911145617667358

BABA,Xi Pivot Fails to Stop Exodus by Big Investors in China Tech,"(Bloomberg) -- Xi Jinping led a parade of officials this spring vowing to revive China’s economy, hoping to repair the damage wrought by years of Covid Zero and regulatory clampdowns. Some of the world’s biggest investors are selling anyway.Most Read from BloombergWorthless Degrees Are Creating an Unemployable Generation in IndiaFox to Pay $787 Million to Settle Election Suit, Dominion SaysApple's AR/VR Headset to Feature Sports, Gaming, iPad Apps and WorkoutsOne Tesla Deal Propels Little-Known Family to $800 Million FortuneApple, Goldman Sachs Debut Savings Account With 4.15% Annual YieldTwo pioneering financiers of China’s private sector — and hence the country’s economic miracle — have signaled in recent days their intentions to continue pulling back from marquee investments in the country. European internet powerhouse Prosus NV registered more than $4 billion of stock in Tencent Holdings Ltd. for potential sale in Hong Kong, while news emerged that SoftBank Group Corp. is preparing to hasten its exit from Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. — the e-commerce leader that made Masayoshi Son’s name.Read more: SoftBank Prepares to Cash In on Long-Held Alibaba StakeThe moves accelerate the unwinding of some of the most lucrative bets in business history. While both Prosus and SoftBank declared their over-arching plans last year and are acting partly due to reasons outside their China outlook, the latest steps have dented investor optimism over a litany of recent promises from Beijing to welcome foreign capital and loosen its grip on the tech sector.“Reported plans to lower exposure in Alibaba by SoftBank may reiterate the prevailing loss of confidence in Chinese tech firms by foreign investors, giving rise to concerns that more may do the same,” said Jun Rong Yeap, an analyst at IG Asia.Tencent slid the most in over two months Wednesday in Hong Kong, while Alibaba wiped out as much as $13 billion of value on Thursday. In New York, Tencent’s US-listed shares rose 3.6% while Alibaba’s gained 2.2% in early trading, both outpacing a 1% gain in the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index. Morgan Stanley analyst Gary Wu said in a note Thursday he didn’t think SoftBank’s selling will have a “meaningful impact” on Alibaba’s financials or business.The developments mark the latest challenge to China’s effort to mend its image as a country that’s increasingly isolating itself from the West and hostile to private capital. Xi again called on foreign investors to “seize opportunities” in China during a tour of southern Guangdong this week, during which he stopped by an LG Display Co. plant.But beyond the tech crackdown of 2021 and 2022, years of clashes over the treatment of ethnic minorities in Xinjiang, the quashing of political dissent in Hong Kong, and the status of Taiwan have stoked skepticism in the US and Europe about Chinese intentions.It’s a dramatic reversal from past decades, when an increasingly open China produced a succession of corporate successes thanks in part to foreign dealmakers.Optimists counter that there may still be upside for companies like Alibaba.“There will definitely be impact in the short term,” said Gong Jingjie, an analyst at Toyo Securities. “But in the longer run, we need to look at its fundamentals.”Alibaba recently announced a plan to unlock value by splitting itself into six separate companies — its most aggressive move since antitrust regulators slapped a record fine on the company in 2021. The company is also working on potentially game-changing initiatives such as investments in artificial intelligence.Last month, billionaire Alibaba co-founder Jack Ma — one of the country’s best-known corporate figures — returned to China after an overseas jaunt lasting more than a year. That was taken as a sign that China, if not exactly back to business as usual, was moving in the right direction.SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son famously invested about $20 million in Alibaba in 2000, holding on through the dot-com bust and the Chinese company’s IPO in 2014. Naspers, Prosus’ parent, invested in Tencent in 2001 — long before before smartphones and apps like WeChat became ubiquitous.But prospects for both Chinese businesses have deteriorated markedly in the past two years. The companies reported their first revenue declines ever in 2022 and are now eking out single-digit gains every quarter — a far cry from their swashbuckling days of consistent double-digit expansion and constant flow of startup deals.SoftBank’s selldown also partly reflects the precarious state of global markets. The company has been offloading some of its biggest holdings in part to shore up its balance sheet at a time when the failure of Silicon Valley Bank and rising interest rates have drained liquidity and added pressure on investment firms to reward jittery LPs. Prosus has said it will use proceeds from Tencent share sales to fund buybacks.“After the global banking crisis and what happened to SVB in the US, it’s much harder to get loan financing in general,” said Steven Leung, executive director of UOB Kay Hian. “For those early investors in Chinese big tech firms, it might be the same case. So they have to accelerate cashing out from their existing holdings, before doing anything, including investing in new opportunities or buying back shares.”--With assistance from Xiao Zibang, Adrian Leung and James Mayger.(Updates with New York trading in fourth paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekAmericans Go Deeper Into Debt as They Use Buy Now, Pay Later Apps for GroceriesVolkswagen Left Behind as China Goes All In on EVsPeople Are Using AI for Therapy, Even Though ChatGPT Wasn’t Built for ItThere Are No Fees at America’s Smallest BankBanking Crises Are Preventable, But Human Nature Gets in the Way©2023 Bloomberg L.P.","April 13, 2023 at 9:00 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/xi-pivot-fails-stop-exodus-084334441.html,Bloomberg,-0.25,0.2,0.07452434396878842,0.32211132488910266
META,Weekly Stock List,"Innovation may be hard to define but, to borrow from former U.S. Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart, you know it when you see it. The United States economy is full of innovation. It has to be. Manufacturing industries that dominated the economy decades ago - textiles, televisions, even automobiles, to a large degree - have moved overseas, where costs are lower. Yet the U.S. economy is at its largest point in history and still growing. If U.S. corporations weren't innovating, creating new products and services, and moving into new markets and applications, the domestic economy would be contracting, not expanding, and capital would not be flooding into the country. Particularly at this juncture of the market and economic cycles, when uncertainty is high due to high inflation and rising interest rates, we look to innovative companies to successfully navigate the challenges. At Argus, an 88-year-old independent research firm that has innovated a time or two in its long history, we have focused on four types of innovative companies: Industry Disruptors; First to Market; New Product Specialists; and Product & Process Perfectors. Here are some examples of companies, featured in our Innovation Theme Model Portfolio.","May 8, 2023 at 9:17 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/m/9946d764-2d7e-382a-9319-356b40cc3e4f/weekly-stock-list.html,Argus Research,0.0,0.0,0.14966883116883117,0.45902705627705637
META,"The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights Alphabet, Microsoft, Meta Platforms and Shopify","Chicago, IL – May 8, 2023 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, Microsoft Corp. MSFT, Meta Platforms, Inc. META and Shopify Inc. SHOP.Here are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:The tech sector is up more than 18% this year, more than double the S&P 500's roughly 7%.But this is a huge sector, with many different kinds of companies offering very different kinds of products and services to often different markets. Therefore, it's difficult to come up with common factors that drive the sector.Until you look at the market capitalization of some of these companies. Alphabet, for instance, with its market cap of over $1.3 trillion, has a much greater impact on the sector's performance when it rises around 19% year to date than, say, BigBear.ai Holdings, although this stock has soared 285%+. The same can be said of Microsoft, with its market cap of over $2.2 trillion (up nearly 27% year to date), or of Meta Platforms with its $614 billion market cap (up 94%) or Shopify with its $59 billion (up 65%).The point is that this is a sector with some very large cap stocks that skew the average whenever they make big moves. Since they have been making big moves this year, it makes sense to see why.The biggest reason perhaps is the stabilization in the interest rate. As inflation rates continue to moderate, the markets have been expecting the Fed to stop raising rates. After the latest hike, the Fed has indicated that there may not be further hikes this year. Rate hikes are a problem for most growth stocks because these are the riskiest assets. Investors put their money into these stocks in the hopes that they'll get outsized returns at some future date.Technology companies may be younger or mature, but by their very nature, they invest huge capital in futuristic innovations that may or may not generate the anticipated returns. Therefore, when higher rates make less risky assets more attractive, some investors switch to those. Additionally, tech companies may also take a certain amount of debt to fund their R&D. Stabilization in the interest rate therefore makes these stocks more attractive.Another reason for the big moves is the effect of the pandemic. In the initial phase of the pandemic, the rapid digitization generated huge business for some of these players. This pulled in five years of demand (by some estimates). As a result, demand dropped drastically in the following period, a situation that persists today, in some segments. Given the disappointing outlook, tech stocks plunged last year, making them more attractive from a valuation perspective.The third reason, and this is specific to the larger cap tech stocks, is that although they invest humongous amounts of cash in their future innovations, they also have certain existing products that are pretty much like cash cows, generating year upon year of solid revenue and cash flows, as in the case of any good quality mature company.Unlike mature players in certain other sectors, these stocks don't pay dividends. Or, just a handful of them – like Apple – do. They tend to pour the whole thing back into the business and maintain large cash balances for financial flexibility. This makes them attractive in times of uncertain demand, especially the mild recession/soft landing that most analysts are anticipating. So, let's take a closer look at some of these big tech stocks:Alphabet Inc.Search giant Alphabet posted strong numbers last quarter, exceeding revenue estimates by 1.5% and earnings estimates by 10.4%. In the past month, the company's 2023 earnings estimate increased 3.9% while the 2024 estimate increased 2.0%. Revenue and earnings are expected to increase an estimated 6.1% and 18.2% this year and 10.6% and 16.1%, respectively in the next.Microsoft Corp.A provider of computer software, productivity solutions, search, cloud infrastructure services and more, Microsoft is easily one of the most attractive players right now. In the last quarter, Microsoft's earnings surprise of 10.4% came on top of a revenue surprise of 3.8%. Analyst estimates for the years ending June 2023 and 2024 have increased 2.9% and 2.4%, respectively. Its revenue is expected to increase 6.3% this year and 10.3% in the next. Earnings are expected to increase 4.3% and 12.1%, respectively.Meta Platforms, Inc. Social media provider Meta posted a sales surprise of 4.2% in the last quarter, which resulted in an earnings surprise of 34.7%. In the last 30 days, its 2023 earnings estimate has increased 12.6% and 2024 estimate 13.2%. Analysts currently expect revenue growth of 8.6% this year and 10.8% in 2024. Earnings are expected to grow 19.6% and 24.3%, respectively.Shopify Inc. Shopify provides an online commerce platform for small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs). The company's March quarter earnings surprise of 50% came on top of revenues that surprised by 4.9%. Analysts have merely fine-tuned their estimates on this company's revenue and earnings, which are expected to grow 18.1% and 25%, respectively in 2023 and 21.6% and 395.8%, respectively the following year.Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) rating on Meta shares and a #2 (Buy) rating on the others.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

META,"Is Meta Platforms, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:META) Latest Stock Performance A Reflection Of Its Financial Health?","Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. View our latest analysis for Meta Platforms Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Meta Platforms is:17% = US$21b ÷ US$125b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.17 in profit.So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.To begin with, Meta Platforms seems to have a respectable ROE. Further, the company's ROE compares quite favorably to the industry average of 6.5%. This certainly adds some context to Meta Platforms' decent 13% net income growth seen over the past five years.As a next step, we compared Meta Platforms' net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 5.3%.Meta Platforms doesn't pay any dividend, meaning that all of its profits are being reinvested in the business, which explains the fair bit of earnings growth the company has seen.","May 8, 2023 at 7:00 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meta-platforms-inc-nasdaq-meta-120017315.html,Simply Wall St.,0.25,0.45,0.15603174603174605,0.45349206349206356

META,Facebook has 3 billion users. Many of them are old.,"Facebook says it is not dead. Facebook also wants you to know that it is not just for “old people,” as young people have been saying for years.There's just one problem: young adults like Devin Walsh have moved on.“I don’t even remember the last time I logged in. It must have been years ago,” said Walsh, 24, who lives in Manhattan and works in public relations.Instead, she checks Instagram, which is also owned by Facebook parent company Meta, about five or six times a day. Then there's TikTok, of course, where she spends about an hour each day scrolling, letting the algorithm find things “I didn't even know I was interested in.”Walsh can't imagine a world in which Facebook, which she joined when she was in 6th grade, becomes a regular part of her life again.""It's the branding, right? When I think of Facebook, I think ugh, like cheugy, older people, like parents posting pictures of their kids, random status updates and also people fighting about political issues,” Walsh said, using the Gen Z term for things that are definitely not cool.The once-cool social media platform born before the iPhone is approaching two decades in existence. For those who came of age around the time Mark Zuckerberg launched thefacebook.com from his Harvard dorm room in 2004, it's been inextricably baked into daily life — even if it's somewhat faded into the background over the years.Facebook faces a particularly odd challenge. Today, 3 billion people check it each month. That’s more than a third of the world’s population. And 2 billion log in every day. Yet it still finds itself in a battle for relevancy, and its future, after two decades of existence.It wasn't always like this. For nearly a decade, Facebook was the place to be, the cultural touchstone, the thing constantly referenced in daily conversations and late-night TV, its founding even the subject of a Hollywood movie. Rival MySpace, which launched only a year earlier, quickly became outdated as the cool kids flocked to Facebook. It didn't help MySpace's fate that it was sold to stodgy old News Corp. in 2005.“It was this weird combination...no one knew how technology worked, but in order to have a MySpace, we all needed to become mini coders. It was so stressful.” said Moira Gaynor, 28. “Maybe that’s even why Facebook took off. Because compared to MySpace it was this beautiful, integrated, wonderful engagement area that we didn’t have before and we really craved after struggling with MySpace for so long.”Positioning himself a visionary, Zuckerberg refused to sell Facebook and pushed his company through the mobile revolution. While some rivals emerged — remember Orkut? — they generally petered out as Facebook soared, seemingly unstoppable despite scandals over user privacy and a failure to address hate speech and misinformation adequately. It reached a billion daily users in 2015.Debra Aho Williamson, an analyst with Insider Intelligence who's followed Facebook since its early days, notes that the site's younger users have been dwindling but doesn't see Facebook going anywhere, at least not any time soon.“The fact that we are talking about Facebook being 20 years old, I think that is a testament of what Mark developed when he was in college. It's pretty incredible,” she said. “It is still a very powerful platform around the world.”AOL was once powerful too, but its user base has aged and now an aol.com email address is little more than a punchline in a joke about technologically illiterate people of a certain age.Tom Alison, who serves as the head of Facebook (Zuckerberg's title is now Meta CEO), sounded optimistic when he outlined the platform's plans to lure in young adults in an interview with The Associated Press.“We used to have a team at Facebook that was focused on younger cohorts, or maybe there was a project or two that was dedicated to coming up with new ideas,” Alison said. “And about two years ago we said no — our entire product line needs to change and evolve and adapt to the needs of the young adults.”He calls it the era of “social discovery.""“It’s very much motivated by what we see the next generation wanting from social media. The simple way that I like to describe it is we want Facebook to be the place where you can connect with the people you know, the people you want to know and the people that you should know,” Alison said.Artificial intelligence is central to this plan. Just as TikTok uses its AI and algorithm to show people videos they didn't know they wanted to see Facebook is hoping to harness its powerful technology to win back the hearts and eyeballs of young adults. Reels, the TikTok-like videos Facebook and Instagram users are bombarded with when they log into both apps, are also key. And, of course, private messaging.“What we are seeing is more people wanting to share reels, discuss reels, and we’re starting to integrate messaging features back into the app to again allow Facebook to be a place where not only do you discover great things that are relevant to you, but you share and you discuss those with people,” Alison said.Facebook has consistently declined to disclose user demographics, which would shed some light on how it is faring among young adults. But outside researchers say their numbers are declining. The same is true for teenagers — although Facebook seems to have stepped back from actively recruiting teens amid concerns about social media’s effects on their mental health.“Young people often shape the future of communication. I mean, that’s basically how Facebook took off — young people gravitated toward it. And we we see that happening with pretty much every social platform that has come on the scene since Facebook,” said Williamson. This year, Insider estimates that about half of TikTok’s users are between the ages of 12 and 24.Williamson doesn't see this trend reversing, but notes that Insider's estimates only go as far as 2026. There's a decline, but it's slow. That year, the research firm expects about 28% of U.S. Facebook's users to be between 18 and 34 years old, compared with nearly 46% for TikTok and 42% for Instagram. The numbers are more stark for teens aged 12-17.“I think the best thing they could do is get away from being a social platform. Like they’ve lost that. But hey, if they want to become the new Yellow Pages, why not?” said Gaynor, who lives in San Diego, California and works in government. “I really like Marketplace. I recently just moved, so that was where I got most of my furniture.”","May 8, 2023 at 5:28 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/facebook-3-billion-users-many-102818646.html,AP Finance,0.3,0.35,0.09164655403593455,0.4030041271412953

META,Apple isnt playing the AI hype game,"In fact, Cook didn’t mention the topic at all in his statement. The only time the CEO broached the topic was when he was prodded by Credit Suisse’s Shannon Cross, who asked for Cook’s thoughts on generative AI and where he sees it going. True to form, the CEO was light on specifics.Despite not mentioning the hottest buzzword since blockchain in his statement, shares of Cook’s Apple jumped more than 4% Friday. It’s not as though Apple doesn’t use AI either. Nearly every product Apple offers takes advantage of AI and machine learning.Cook specifically called out the company’s use of the technology to power the Apple Watch’s fall detection and ECG, as well as the crash detection capabilities in the watch and iPhone.“It's absolutely remarkable,” Cook said. “And so we view AI as huge and we'll continue weaving it in our products on a very thoughtful basis.”Apple is also set to hold its annual WWDC developer conference next month, during which it could make some kind of announcement regarding generative AI.But Apple’s ethos is to let technology largely fade into the background while boosting its products as a means to an end. In other words, if Apple does begin implementing some form of generative AI into its product portfolio, don’t expect the company to dwell on the fact that it’s doing so.If anything, you’ll hear about how the technology will power an updated version of Siri, or perhaps become a new assistant meant to help you better plan things like trips or your daily work schedule.However Apple decides to approach generative AI, bank on the company focusing more on how it helps its products, rather than the tech itself.For the latest earnings reports and analysis, earnings whispers and expectations, and company earnings news, click hereRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance","May 5, 2023 at 2:07 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-isnt-playing-the-ai-hype-game-190726240.html,Yahoo Finance,-0.4,0.4,0.28312615955473097,0.5003865182436611

META,Meta Platforms scoops up AI networking chip team from Graphcore,"By Katie Paul(Reuters) - Meta Platforms Inc has hired an Oslo-based team that until late last year was building artificial-intelligence networking technology at British chip unicorn Graphcore.A Meta spokesperson confirmed the hirings in response to a request for comment, after Reuters identified 10 people whose LinkedIn profiles said they worked at Graphcore until December 2022 or January 2023 and subsequently joined Meta in February or March of this year.""We recently welcomed a number of highly-specialized engineers in Oslo to our infrastructure team at Meta.

Nvidia, AMD and Intel Corp all make such network chips.In addition to its network chip, Meta is also designing a complex computing chip to both train AI models and perform inference, a process in which the trained models make judgments and generate responses to prompts, although it does not expect that chip to be ready until around 2025.Graphcore, one of the UK's most valuable tech startups, once was seen by investors like Microsoft and venture capital firm Sequoia as a promising potential challenger to Nvidia's commanding lead in the market for AI chip systems.However, it faced a setback in 2020 when Microsoft scrapped an early deal to buy Graphcore's chips for its Azure cloud computing platform, according to a report by UK newspaper The Times.

META,Companies need to be socially responsible in the metaverse too,"Companies faces three types of challenges in the metaverse.Companies need to develop strategies to establish that they take their DSR seriously, before regulators force them to do so. They can turn a proactive approach into a strength, ensuring that regulation will make the metaverse work even better. Companies need to act on three fronts simultaneously:In the same way, business should adopt industry-wide standards to tackle, say, the problem of metaverse gaming addiction among children. Don’t forget, when the regulations in countries such as China spill over to other nations, governments will start with the prevailing standards. Developing them proactively will better position companies to work with governments, and may even eliminate the need for laws.While companies can look to the metaverse to drive growth in the long run, they must get ready to confront the related challenges. They must develop a set of DSR principles whose execution must be the joint responsibility of platforms, companies, and governments. Indeed, the metaverse ecosystem’s stakeholders must ensure alignment not just in value creation and capture, but also in making the metaverse a safe place for every user.François Candelon is a managing director and senior partner at BCG and the global director of the BCG Henderson Institute. Lisa Krayer is a project leader at BCG and an ambassador at the BCG Henderson Institute. Winson Chen is a project leader at BCG and an ambassador at the BCG Henderson Institute. Some companies featured in this column are past or current clients of BCG.","May 5, 2023 at 4:30 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/companies-socially-responsible-metaverse-too-093000726.html,Fortune,0.2,0.55,0.07243589743589746,0.39358974358974363

I’d say Meta’s alleged infringements demonstrate why new, across-the-board protections are needed, but bills that may not pass should not preempt the possibility of more urgent enforcement.Speaking of privacy law, the EU’s highest court issued a couple rulings this morning that clarify the impact of the General Data Protection Regulation, which came into effect five years ago this month (they grow up so fast).

META,Latin American election influence operation linked to Miami marketing firm,"By Zeba Siddiqui and Christopher BingSAN FRANCISCO/WASHINGTON, May 4 (Reuters) - A Miami-based digital marketing firm was behind a series of covert political influence operations in Latin America over the last year, Facebook-owner Meta said this week, a rare exposé of an apparent U.S.-based misinformation-for-hire outfit.Predictvia, which is registered as a business in Florida, says on its website that it stands on the ""front line of the fight against misinformation"" and combats ""coordinated efforts to manipulate public discourse.""Meta analysts found, however, that Predictvia ran a network of fake accounts – four on Instagram and 24 on Facebook, along with 54 Facebook pages – that posed as news media outlets, journalists, and lifestyle brands.The accounts posted criticisms of the mayor of the Guatemalan city of San Juan Sacatepequez, Juan Carlos Pellecer, and in Honduras they focused on alleged political corruption and criticism of the president of the Congress, Luis Redondo. Neither politician returned a request for comment.Predictvia also ran extensive information operations that sought to interfere with politics in Honduras and Guatemala on Twitter, two former Twitter employees, who asked to stay anonymous, told Reuters. The extent of the company's Twitter activity established by the news agency has not been previously disclosed. Twitter did not respond to requests for comment on this article.""It's a classic pattern that you tend to see with for-hire influence operations,"" said Ben Nimmo, Meta's Global Threat Intelligence Lead. ""There isn't a single narrative that they're pushing across different countries; it tends to be much more tailored per country.""Predictvia Chief Executive Ernesto Olivo Valverde and other senior staff did not respond to multiple requests for comment from Reuters.Reuters was unable to determine who Predictvia was working for, or to assess the success of its misinformation efforts.Meta said it had banned Predictvia - which it said operated from both Venezuela and the United States - from its services and had sent it a cease and desist letter.Government officials in Honduras and Guatemala did not immediately respond to requests for comment about the alleged misinformation operation against politicians in their countries.Meta says it regularly takes down disinformation and misinformation operations in order to maintain the integrity of its platform. It said in its report that the investigation into Predictvia was triggered by Reuters questions earlier this year.Around 6,700 accounts followed one or more of the Facebook pages in Predictvia's influence network, and it had 400 followers on Instagram, Meta said.The Predictvia network also included other social media platforms, Meta said. Its analysts found two Twitter accounts linked to the company, one of which describes itself online as a civil organization seeking to post ""truthful content"" ahead of Guatemala's national elections in June. Both were active as of Tuesday.TWITTER OPERATIONSLast year, Twitter staff traced thousands of fake accounts on its platform to a small number of Predictvia employees, the former Twitter employees, who said they were involved with that probe, told Reuters.""I was amazed that they were basically doing all of this on their own,"" one of the employees said. ""Just the scale of it was quite significant.""Three former Twitter employees told Reuters that Twitter had turned over its data on the fake accounts last August to a nonprofit Latin American research group named Cazadores de ('Hunters of') Fake News. The data sets given to Cazadores by Twitter did not mention Predictvia, the former employees said.Twitter said in a September 2022 blog that it had shared datasets about influence operations with Cazadores. In August 2022, Cazadores also published three reports on Honduran and Guatemalan politics that it said were based on the Twitter information, although those reports did not name Predictvia.The exchange was part of a program called The Twitter Moderation Research Consortium (TMRC) that sought to combat manipulation by sharing data with academics and researchers. Former Twitter employees told Reuters in January that most of the staff involved in the TMRC had since left and Reuters could not determine if it was still operational.In one of the Cazadores reports, it said the data showed there were more than 1,300 accounts posting about Honduras. It said ""several"" of the accounts ""manipulated the conversation on Twitter"" by posting messages encouraging abstention from voting in the 2021 presidential election and criticisms of two opposition candidates, Xiomara Castro and Yani Rosenthal.Neither immediately responded to a request for comment. Castro won the presidency and it was not clear if the influence operation had any impact on the election outcome.""The election influence and misinformation campaign studied was at least partially based on ""astroturfing"" i.e. the pushing of inauthentic narratives, with the use of covert accounts posing as real users,"" the Cazadores report said.The network separately operated 2,000 accounts spreading disinformation and ""defamatory"" content against several targets in Guatemala, Cazadores said in another report.Some of the accounts criticized the country's anti-corruption agency, CICIG, in a coordinated manner to make it look like a subject of significant discontent, the group said in its report. While the agency was closed by the government in 2019, several misinformation campaigns against CICIG-initiated cases that were still active took place in 2020-2021, it found. The former director of CICIG did not return a request for comment.Twitter had since suspended all the accounts in these networks, the report added.Founded in 2013 by Valverde, Predictvia was originally focused on developing an artificial intelligence-based market research tool, according to three former employees who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity.In 2015, the company described itself on its website as a team of nine programmers, mathematicians, data specialists, and game designers using tools ""to predict what things people (specific users) like the best or hate the most.""

In April, the Dow advanced 2.5%, marking its best month since January. The S&P 500 gained 1.5%, finishing the second positive month in a row. The Nasdaq Composite also rose marginally despite a weak start.After a highly disappointing 2022, U.S. stocks markets remained in positive territory despite the threat of a near-term recession. Year to date, the Dow and the S&P 500 have advanced 1.6% and 7.3%, respectively. The Nasdaq Composite has rallied 15.4%.The momentum of the U.S. stock markets is likely to sustain in May.

META,"UPDATE 1-Google, Meta executives push back against Canada online news bill","(Adds comment from Facebook executive and Canadian government)By Sam Jabri-PickettTORONTO, May 3 (Reuters) - Google and Meta would withdraw access to news articles in Canada if legislation compelling internet companies to pay news publishers is passed, company executives told Canadian lawmakers on Wednesday.Canada's proposed legislation would force platforms like Google parent Alphabet Inc and Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc to negotiate commercial deals and pay Canadian news publishers for their content, part of a broader global trend to make tech firms pay for news.Google may be forced to remove links to news articles found in Canadian search results if the bill passes, its vice president of news Richard Gingras said in testimony to a Senate committee, citing an ""uncapped financial liability"" if it had to pay publishers for linking to their sites.Meta would also end the availability of news content in Canada if the bill is passed as currently drafted, said Rachel Curran, head of public policy for Meta in Canada.Ottawa's proposal is similar to a ground-breaking law that Australia passed in 2021, which also triggered threats from Google and Facebook to curtail their services.

META,3 Stocks That Moved Wildly in Today's Session,"It’s no secret that large price swings are commonly seen in the market post-earnings or following news headlines, with market participants reacting quickly in response.And today, we’ve seen several stocks undergo volatility in the session, including Advanced Micro Devices AMD, Starbucks SBUX, and Meta Platforms META. AMD and SBUX shares are experiencing volatility post-earnings, whereas META shares are undergoing volatility following an FTC announcement.Below is a chart illustrating the performance of all three year-to-date, with the S&P 500 blended in as a benchmark.Let’s take a closer look at why these stocks are moving in today’s session.Meta PlatformsMETA shares witnessed volatility following an announcement from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). The FTC proposed modifications to its original 2020 privacy order with the company, with the agency claiming that it’s failed to comply with the order in its entirety.As part of these changes, Meta would no longer be allowed to monetize youth data (those under 18). Samuel Levine, Director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said, “The company’s recklessness has put young users at risk, and Facebook needs to answer for its failures.”Following the headline, META shares faced selling pressure but have since bounced from their intraday lows.Meta Platforms’ latest quarterly print caught the attention of nearly all market participants, delivering a solid 35% EPS surprise and revealing optimistic guidance. Quarterly revenue totaled $28.6 billion, above expectations, reflecting the first Y/Y revenue increase in four quarters.Analysts have raised their earnings expectations for the technology titan over the last several months, helping land the stock into the highly-coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Advanced Micro DevicesDespite posting a double-beat, Advanced Micro Devices shares faced volatility post-earnings in yesterday’s after-hours session. Shares have faced adverse price action throughout trading so far, down roughly 8% from yesterday’s close.AMD posted earnings of $0.60 per share, exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate by roughly 7%. Quarterly revenue totaled $5.4 billion, modestly ahead of expectations and 9% lower than the year-ago figure of $5.9 billion.However, a part of the quarterly release that spooked market participants was the results from AMD’s Client segment, which includes revenue from PC processors. Client segment revenue totaled $739 million, down 65% year-over-year as PC shipments have rapidly declined. Analysts have had a bearish stance on the company’s earnings outlook as of late, with AMD’s earnings outlook shifting negatively across nearly all timeframes.StarbucksLike AMD, Starbucks posted better-than-expected results, exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate by more than 15%. Quarterly revenue totaled $8.7 billion, 4% above expectations and improving 14% year-over-year.There were also several notable highlights from the release, including –North America comparable store sales increased 12% year-over-year, and China comparable store sales saw year-over-year growth of 3%, both driven by an increase in comparable transactions. Further, the company opened 464 net new stores throughout the quarter, bringing the total tally to 36,434 stores globally.Still, despite posting overall positive results, the company didn’t lift its guidance, perhaps spooking some investors. The adverse price action could be a reflection of profit-taking, as SBUX shares were up 15% year-to-date prior to the earnings release.Bottom LineOn any given day, we see large price swings within the market, whether that’s in response to a news headline or quarterly results.And all three stocks above – Advanced Micro Devices AMD, Starbucks SBUX, and Meta Platforms META – experienced volatile price action in today’s session.Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

What can you tell us about what the FTC's doing now? They issued a statement today. What are you seeing?This is from Samuel Levine. He's the director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection. He says, ""Facebook has repeatedly violated its privacy promises. The company's recklessness has put young users at risk, and Facebook needs to answer for its failures."" Now, what they're talking about is a number of issues that Facebook-- Meta-- has had with the FTC throughout the years, whether it's having to do with not keeping its promises about privacy, whether it has to do with the Cambridge Analytica scandal. And so this is just kind of a continuation of that.And basically, what the FTC is alleging here is that Meta is not abiding by the agreements that it went into with the FTC with regards to those prior problems. And so they're basically saying, look, they haven't fully taken care of these problems, so now what we're going to do is say, Facebook, Meta, whoever, if you collect any data from anyone that's younger than 18, you cannot profit from that.So Meta spokesperson responded to this saying, ""This is a political stunt. Despite three years of continual engagement with the FTC around our agreement, they provided no opportunity to discuss this new, totally unprecedented theory."" So obviously, there's going to be a lot of back and forth here.Meta has not done too well with the FTC. They paid that $5 billion fine with regards to Cambridge Analytica, though that's pretty much just a drop in the bucket for them. So we'll see how they come out here. Don't forget, the FTC is also suing them to essentially break them up. So yeah, not any good blood there.For publishers, look, this is a dream, basically. They're getting out there with this younger audience-- TikTok there, the younger crowd. If they can get those users in there, they're hooked for life. That's the whole idea with this.So I mean, if they're able to pull this off and do it well, it would be a boon for both. However, it's worth noting that companies have tried similar things like this before, and then axed it as soon as times got tough financially-- looking at Meta. So they've done something along the lines. Not exactly, but they've worked with media before and then basically said, no, we can't do that Anymore, And shut it all down. So we'll see what happens.","May 3, 2023 at 3:03 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/ftc-moves-prohibit-meta-profiting-200347727.html,Yahoo Finance Video,-0.05,0.2,0.12784026489383632,0.3903402648938364
META,"FTC proposes block on Facebooks youth data monetization, pause on new products","“This is the third time the FTC has taken action against Facebook for allegedly failing to protect users’ privacy,” the press release states.According to the FTC, Facebook’s most recent infractions include misleading parents about their ability to control who their children contact in Facebook’s Messenger Kids app, and misrepresenting how much access it gives third party app developers to private user data.“Despite the company’s promises that children using Messenger Kids would only be able to communicate with contacts approved by their parents, children in certain circumstances were able to communicate with unapproved contacts in group text chats and group video calls,” the FTC said.According to the commission, an independent assessor concluded that Facebook had broken its promise to cut off third party app developers from accessing private user information for users who had not used an app in the past 90 days.Under the new rules proposed on Wednesday, the FTC said Facebook and its VR platform Oculus would be “prohibited from profiting” from data collected on users under age 18. Additional rules would limit the companies' use of facial recognition technology, and require more user protections around the technology. Facebook would further be required to obtain approval from an independent assessor before releasing new or modified products, services, and features.The FTC has asked Facebook to respond to its allegations. If an answer is received, the Commission will consider the issues raised and then determine whether to go ahead with or modify its proposal.In an email to Yahoo Finance, a spokesperson for Meta called the FTC's new proposal a political stunt.""Despite three years of continual engagement with the FTC around our agreement, they provided no opportunity to discuss this new, totally unprecedented theory,"" the spokesperson said.

META,Apples earnings could buoy or sink Big Techs earnings season,"Wednesday, May 3, 2023“None of what's already been reported matters come Thursday night,” explained Deepwater Asset Management Managing Partner Gene Munster.“And the reason is ... because [of] the size of Apple, and also it's been relatively stable too. It's done a better job of enduring this versus other tech, so if there is a problem, you can throw out all the good news from Microsoft and Google and Meta,” Munster added.In turn, a solid result from Apple could help buoy the industry and drive up shares of other Big Tech names. But a miss could mean increased pressure on rival tech stocks, just as the sector looks to finally move past its COVID-induced hangover.Analysts expect Apple to report revenue of $92.6 billion for the second quarter, a 4.8% decline from the $97.3 billion Apple brought in during the same quarter last year. That's about in line with the 5% decline Apple posted in Q1.“We believe the broader tech industry is all on pins and needles waiting for Apple's results as many of the tech haters continue to yell fire in a crowded theater around softening demand, with Apple the best barometer globally of this metric,” Wedbush Managing Director Dan Ives told Yahoo Finance via email.For investors tracking the S&P 500, a miss by Apple could have an outsized impact on their portfolios.While Apple’s enormous size and weight relative to market competitors gives its results added importance, the company’s performance is also a key indicator for consumer spending.“Most, if not all, iPhones are purchased for consumers. Macs, for the most part, are purchased for consumers and/or small, medium businesses,” explained UBS Managing Director David Vogt. “So it's really more of a bellwether or a barometer regarding high end consumer spending.”A miss on Apple’s revenue, especially for its iPhone business, would mean consumers are spending less and holding back on making large purchases. Worse still would be any signal that revenue will come in weaker than anticipated in Q3. That would signal that Apple anticipates customers will continue to hold back on spending their cash.It all comes down to Thursday night.

It would also face expanded limitations on using facial recognition technology.Meta shares fell as much as 2% on Wednesday but pared most of those losses and were off 0.3% at $238.50.Meta, which also owns Instagram, relies on digital ads targeted on the basis of its users' personal data for more than 98% of its revenue.The company maintains the world's biggest social networks, but is battling short video app TikTok for young users' attention after it soared to popularity with American teens several years ago.In a statement, Meta said the FTC action was ""a political stunt"" and that the FTC failed to act against ""Chinese companies, like TikTok.""""We will vigorously fight this action and expect to prevail,"" the company said.The FTC move on Wednesday is the first step in the process of changing the 2019 agreement.

META,"FTC: Facebook misled parents, failed to guard kids' privacy","U.S. regulators say Facebook misled parents and failed to protect the privacy of children using its Messenger Kids app, including misrepresenting the access it provided to app developers to private user data.Meta would also be subject to other limitations, including with its use of face-recognition technology and be required to provide additional privacy protections for its users.“Facebook has repeatedly violated its privacy promises,” said Samuel Levine, director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection. “The company’s recklessness has put young users at risk, and Facebook needs to answer for its failures.”Meta called the announcement a “political stunt.”“Despite three years of continual engagement with the FTC around our agreement, they provided no opportunity to discuss this new, totally unprecedented theory. Let’s be clear about what the FTC is trying to do: usurp the authority of Congress to set industry-wide standards and instead single out one American company while allowing Chinese companies, like TikTok, to operate without constraint on American soil,” Meta said in a prepared statement.The Menlo Park, California company added that it will ""vigorously fight"" the FTC's action and expects to prevail.At the time, Facebook said Messenger Kids wouldn't show ads or collect data for marketing, though it would collect some data it said was necessary to run the service.In early 2018, a group of 100 experts, advocates and parenting organizations contested Facebook’s claims that the app was filling a need kids had for a messaging service. The group included nonprofits, psychiatrists, pediatricians, educators and the children’s music singer Raffi Cavoukian.“Messenger Kids is not responding to a need — it is creating one,” the letter said. “It appeals primarily to children who otherwise would not have their own social media accounts.” Another passage criticized Facebook for “targeting younger children with a new product.”Facebook, in response to the letter, said at the time that the app “helps parents and children to chat in a safer way,” and emphasized that parents are “always in control” of their kids’ activity.The FTC also said Facebook, from late 2017 until 2019, “misrepresented that parents could control whom their children communicated with through its Messenger Kids product.”“Despite the company’s promises that children using Messenger Kids would only be able to communicate with contacts approved by their parents, children in certain circumstances were able to communicate with unapproved contacts in group text chats and group video calls,” the FTC said.Meta critics applauded the FTC's action. Jeffrey Chester, the executive director of the nonprofit Center for Digital Democracy, called it a “a long-overdue intervention into what has become a huge national crisis for young people.”Meta, and with its platforms like Instagram and Facebook, Chester added, “are at the center of a powerful commercialized social media system that has spiraled out of control, threatening the mental health and well-being of children and adolescents.”The company, he added, has not done enough to address existing problems — and is now unleashing “even more powerful data gathering and targeting tactics fueled by immersive content, virtual reality and artificial intelligence, while pushing youth further into the metaverse with no meaningful safeguards.”As part of the proposed changes to the FTC’s 2020 order (which was announced in 2019 and finalized later), Meta would also be required to pause launching new products and services without “written confirmation from the assessor that its privacy program is in full compliance” with the order.Meta has 30 days to respond to the FTC's latest action.","May 3, 2023 at 12:12 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ftc-facebook-misled-parents-failed-171238399.html,AP Finance,-0.5,0.3,0.08754234895539241,0.4249858836815358

META,FTC proposes tightening 2020 privacy order with Meta,"WASHINGTON, May 3 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Trade Commission on Wednesday accused Meta's Facebook of misleading parents about protections for children, in breach of a 2019 agreement on privacy, and proposed tightening the order.Specifically, the FTC said Facebook misled parents about how much control they had over who their children had contact with in the Messenger Kids app and was deceptive about how much access app developers had to users' private data.The FTC's proposed changes include barring Facebook from making money off data collected on users under age 18, including in its virtual reality business. It would also face expanded limitation on using facial recognition technology.The action on Wednesday is the first step in the process of changing the order. Facebook will have 30 days to answer. The company can appeal any commission decision to an appeals court.The FTC has twice before settled with Facebook for privacy violations.The first was in 2012. Facebook agreed in 2019 to pay a record $5 billion fine to resolve allegations it had violated the 2012 consent order by misleading users about how much control they had over their personal data.

META,Sui Mainnet Goes Live as Crypto Project Takes on Aptos and DeFi Giants,"Sui, the buzzy layer 1 blockchain boasting a $2 billion valuation, launched its mainnet on Wednesday as it jockeyed to edge out rival Aptos and other decentralized finance (DeFi) heavyweights.The blockchain, founded by ex-Meta Platforms (META) employees, has more than 200 projects in its directory and another 100-odd projects vying to build on its network.Sui faced several stumbling blocks on the decentralization front, however.The network has more than 2,100 nodes operating across 43 countries. But those nodes are primarily concentrated in Germany and the U.S., with a smattering of nodes running across Asia and eastern Europe. It’s worth noting that the network is still in its infancy, and that over time the distribution of validators will likely become more distributed.The distribution of token holders also remains unclear at press time.Mysten Labs, the blockchain’s core contributor, topped up its coffers with $300 million through a series of raises last year to support construction of the network’s central infrastructure and fast-track the Sui ecosystem’s adoption.Its success in securing VC funding pre-launch has invited comparisons to Aptos, another relatively young blockchain with a large VC backing. Both blockchains were designed by teams from Diem, Meta’s failed stablecoin project gamble, formerly known as Libra, that was shelved by the tech giant in 2022. And Move, a Rust-based programming language that was developed at Meta, undergirds both networks.Critics have blasted Sui for its tokenomics in recent weeks.Meanwhile, Binance added support for SUI to BNB and TUSD holders through its bootstrapping portal, Launchpad, earlier this week.

META,Mirror publisher blames Mark Zuckerberg for sales slump,"Reach said it had suffered a slowdown in page views after the social media company's bosses changed the way it presents news content.Last year, parent company Meta overhauled Facebook’s news feed, splitting it into separate “Home” and “Feeds” tabs in a move that deprioritised posts from publishers.Reach said the changes had led to a reduction in referred traffic across the sector.As a result, Reach posted a 14.5pc fall in digital revenues over the first four months of the year, with advertising revenues down by almost a fifth.Meta has also scrapped its instant articles feature, which enabled news links to load more quickly in the app.Speaking when the changes were made in July 2022, Meta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said the tweaks ensured more users would not miss their friends’ updates.Reach's print revenues proved more resilient, falling only 3pc thanks to increases in cover prices and better-than-expected advertising performance.Overall, revenues were down just under 6pc over the period.Those cuts came weeks after 190 redundancies were announced in January amid efforts to save £30m a year.Reach said it expected to reduce operating costs by between 5pc and 6pc this year as a result of the cuts, with most savings to be achieved in the second half.It is also pinning hopes on its expansion in the US, where it now has almost 100 full-time roles and expects to launch US websites for both the Express and Mirror over the next few months.Reach added that its comparatives are less demanding in the second half due to weak trading over Black Friday and Christmas last year, while it held its forecasts for full-year profit steady at £95.3m.Jim Mullen, chief executive of Reach, said: “External factors continue to impact digital revenue, delivery of the customer value strategy is driving a higher quality mix, underpinned by the strength of print.“Our focus on data means customers are receiving and responding more often to relevant content and a more engaging user experience.

META,"California bill advances, requiring Big Tech to pay for news","SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — Big Tech companies such as Google and Meta might soon have to pay media outlets for posting and using their news content under a proposed California measure attempting to save local journalism.The bill, which cleared an important Assembly Judiciary Committee hearing Tuesday with bipartisan support, would require Google and Meta to share with California media companies their advertising revenue stemming from the news and other reported content. The amount would be determined through an arbitration process.Supporters of the bill said it would provide a “lifeline” to local news organizations that have seen their advertising revenues nosedive in the digital era. Opponents, including trade groups and some journalism groups, said the legislation would be an unprecedented mandate that violates the First Amendment.The bill would mandate that at least 70% of their revenue go to local news organizations to help pay for reporters' salaries. Big Tech companies would also be prohibited from retaliating against a news outlet for demanding a fee by excluding their content on the platforms.“As news consumption has moved online, community news outlets have been downsized and closing at an alarming rate,” said Assemblymember Buffy Wicks of Oakland, who authored the bill, said during the Tuesday hearing.The Democrat said that California has lost more than 100 news organizations in the past decade.“The dominant type platforms, both search engines and social networks, have such unrivaled market power that newsrooms are coerced to share the content they produce, which tech companies sell advertising against for almost no compensation in return,” she said, noting her bill is being backed by major journalism unions such as the News Media Alliance and Media Guild of the West, which represents The Los Angeles Times and other newsrooms.But critics of the bill said the legislation is unconstitutional for requiring online platforms to post content from all news organizations. It would also reward clickbait content and limit the ability for Google and Meta to fight misinformation on their platforms as it could be seen as retaliation, said a representative from Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights group.Chris Krewson, executive director of LION Publishers, a national news group representing more than 450 independent newsrooms, said the bill is “fundamentally flawed” and wasn't written with small newsrooms in mind.The bill would mostly benefit newspaper chains and hedge funds that have gutted local newsrooms in the last few decades, he said. His group represents more than 50 local newsrooms in California, 80% of which are operations with five or fewer journalists. Most of those news outlets wouldn't meet the requirements to benefit, he said.“I applaud the lawmaker for getting bipartisan support on this,” Krewson said in an interview Tuesday. “But this is backward.”Over the last two years, LION Publishers has received at least $1 million in funding from Meta but Krewson said he's not speaking on the tech company's behalf.U.S. lawmakers are also pushing for similar initiatives, reintroducing a bill in March that failed in the last congressional session and would have allowed news companies to jointly negotiate an advertising rate with tech giants such as Google.Despite clearing another hurdle Tuesday, questions remain about how the bill would be implemented. Some lawmakers noted that Meta's Facebook and Google do not operate the same way. Google scrapes news websites and provides users with summaries of reported content, while Facebook shows content such as photos, videos and articles to users based on their activities on the platform.Democratic Assemblymember Matt Haney of San Francisco said he's also concerned with how the state would ensure the money goes to local journalists.“How do we actually make sure that this isn't simply profits handed from one company to another big company?"" he asked at the hearing Thursday.Wicks said she plans to have clarifications on those concerns before the June 2 deadline, which is the last day the Assembly could vote on the bill before it is taken up by the Senate. Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom has not indicated whether he would back such legislation.","May 2, 2023 at 6:57 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/california-bill-advances-requiring-big-235738881.html,AP Finance,0.0,0.1,0.03532986111111112,0.3033895502645503
META,"Instagram, Google See Surge in Reports of Online Child Abuse","(Bloomberg) -- Reports of child exploitation online increased at many of the biggest tech and social media firms over the last year, including Meta Platforms Inc.’s Instagram and Alphabet Inc.’s Google.Most Read from BloombergTexas Mass Shooting’s Bloody Images Add to Fervor in Gun DebatePowell’s Bet Against Recession Looks Good — Minus the Credit Crunch and a DC StandoffFootball Stadiums Belong in the SuburbsBiden Trails Trump as His Approval Rating Hits Low in ABC PollSingapore’s Soaring Rents Are Becoming a Political ProblemTikTok, Amazon.com Inc.’s Twitch, Reddit Inc., and the chat apps Omegle and Discord Inc. also saw increases, according to a Tuesday report from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.The US child safety agency received over 32 million reports involving online enticement, child sexual abuse material and child sex trafficking in 2022 — some 2.7 million more than the year before.While child sexual abuse material, or CSAM, was the largest category, there was an 82% increase in reports regarding online enticement. The center partially attributes the increase to financial “sextortion,” which involves targeting kids to share explicit photographs and blackmailing them for money.“If you look at the increase in reports from from 2021 to 2022, it can mainly be attributed to the reports submitted from electronic services providers who were already submitting significant amount of reports to the CyberTipline in previous year,” a spokesperson for the center said. In 2022, the group sent 49,000 of the reports to law enforcement.Reports from Discord and Omegle more than quintupled. Google’s reports more than doubled to 2.1 million. TikTok, Twitch and Grindr also experienced sizable increases.Other companies’ reports trended downward, including Meta’s Facebook and WhatsApp, as well as Dropbox. The leap between reports in 2020 and 2021 was more significant, at 35%.Electronic service providers are legally required to report child sexual abuse material to the center when they become aware of it. Over the last several years, tech firms and social media companies have developed increasingly powerful tools to proactively identify and remove online abuse.Spokespeople for Reddit, Grindr, Discord, Amazon Photo, Twitch, Meta and Snapchat cited advanced detection of online abuse when asked to comment on the increase in reports. Many also said they’re committed to removing the material.Omegle, TikTok and Google didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. A Microsoft spokesperson shared the company’s digital safety content report. Amazon said it only began collecting the data in June, 2021.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekWhy Launch Rockets When You Can Just Fling Them Into Space?Even $500 Million a Year From Google Isn’t Enough to Save FirefoxBiden Administration Tamps Down Talk of US-China DecouplingAirbus Bets on a Stretched A220 Jet to Beat Boeing’s 737Data Science Is the Hot New Master’s at B-Schools©2023 Bloomberg L.P.","May 2, 2023 at 6:13 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/instagram-google-see-surge-reports-231347144.html,Bloomberg,0.0,0.0,0.16130624426078974,0.40818411386593206

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Meta Platforms Inc. META, Watsco Inc. WSO, PulteGroup Inc. PHM, D.R. Horton Inc. DHI and Manhattan Associates Inc. MANH.Wall Street completed last month on a positive note despite volatility. In April, the Dow advanced 2.5%, marking its best month since January. The S&P 500 gained 1.5%, finishing the second positive month in a row.The Nasdaq Composite also rose marginally despite a weak start. The tech-heavy index regained momentum last week supported by strong first-quarter earnings of big techs. Last week, the Nasdaq Composite ended 1.3% higher, while the Dow and the S&P 500 rose 0.9% each.The momentum of the U.S. stock markets is likely to sustain in May. The major driver of this month will be the Fed’s FOMC meeting and the first-quarter 2023 earnings season.The Fed is scheduled to meet its FOMC meeting on May 2 and 3. In the post-FOMC statement in March, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said that the central bank is approaching the end of its ongoing interest rate hike regime. The terminal rate is likely to be 5.125%, which means just one 25 basis-point rate hike from the existing range of 4.75-5%.Per the CME FedWatch, there exists an 85.5% probability of a 25-basis point rate hike while a 14.5% probability for the central bank to maintain the status quo for the benchmark lending rate. In March, Powell said that no reduction in the Fed fund rate is expected before 2024. However, at present 77.2% of respondents are expecting a rate reduction by late 2023.U.S. corporates have presented relatively good earnings results so far despite the threat of a recession later this year.As of Apr 28, 267 companies on the S&P 500 Index have reported their quarterly financial numbers. Total earnings of these companies are down 2.4% year over year on 4.1% higher revenues. Further, 77.2% of companies have surpassed earnings estimates while 73% have surpassed revenue estimates.Our projection has shown that total earnings of the S&P 500 Index are set to decline 5.7% year over year on 2.8% higher revenues compared with a 10% year-over-year decline in earnings on 1.7% higher revenues, estimated at the beginning of the reporting cycle. This will follow a 5.4% year-over-year decline in earnings of the S&P 500 Index on 5.9% higher revenues in fourth-quarter 2022.However, as developed regions mature, Meta Platforms has taken measures to drive penetration in emerging markets of South East Asia, Latin America and Africa. Of all places, India deserves a-special mention in terms of user growth. The world’s second-largest populated country offers tremendous potential for META. With China off the radar, India can prove to be a terrific growth engine for Meta.The stock price of META has climbed 12.8% in the past month. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 8.5% over the last seven days.Also, operating efficiencies and strategic acquisitions added to the positives of Watsco. It is to be noted that Watsco is investing heavily to enhance customer experience through e-commerce and deploying technology that improves order fill rates with speed and accuracy. In addition, WSO is focused on enhancing shareholder value.The stock price of WSO has advanced 8.2% in the past month. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.1% over the last seven days.Earnings estimates for 2023 have increased in the past 30 days. Although a challenging sales environment, higher cancellation rates, supply-chain issues, and significant inflation are dampening the performance, the improving interest rate environment is raising hope.The stock price of PHM has jumped 13.8% in the past month. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 13.3% over the last seven days.DHI’s production capabilities, industry-leading market share, solid acquisition strategy, broad geographic footprint and diverse product offerings across multiple brands and price points are encouraging.The stock price of DHI has surged 12% in the past month.

LTH.Closing out last week, the Fed’s favored inflation report — Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) — came in line with estimates. Among other economic positives, the regional bank failures of last month are likely in the rear-view mirror, while the labor market continues to be resilient.At the same time, we should avoid painting an overly optimistic picture by overstating the improvements. While we are well off the peaks we saw in 2022, we have apparently hit a bed of resistance. In other words, inflation is indeed coming down, but too slowly. It means a near-certainty that another quarter-point rate hike is in the cards.We believe that more visibility regarding the future market direction will only be available post first-quarter 2023 earnings season, along with management guidance and business outlook.Till then, investors who want to stay exposed to the equity setup should focus on good investment opportunities. One of the ways such potential plays could be identified is to look for signs of relative price strength.Finally, it is crucial to find out whether analysts are optimistic about the upcoming earnings of these companies. In order to do this, we have added positive estimate revisions for the current quarter’s (Q1) earnings to our screen. When a stock undergoes an upward revision, it leads to additional price gains.Here are five of the 10 stocks that made it through the screen:Over the past 60 days, Boyd Gaming saw the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 move up 6.8%. It beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the last two quarters.

META,Meta Platforms Raises $8.5 Billion in Second-Ever Bond Sale,"(Bloomberg) -- Meta Platforms Inc. emerged as the first mega-cap technology company to tap the US investment-grade bond market amid turmoil in the financial sector that has toppled five banks since March.Most Read from BloombergJPMorgan Ends First Republic’s Turmoil After FDIC SeizureFirst Republic’s Jumbo Mortgages Brought On Bank’s FailureIBM to Pause Hiring for Jobs That AI Could DoMorgan Stanley Plans 3,000 More Job Cuts as Dealmaking SlumpsNigeria Targeted a UK Mansion; Its Next Leader’s Son Now Owns ItThe social-media behemoth, which reported earnings last week, raised $8.5 billion in a five-part deal, according to a person familiar with the matter. The longest portion of the offering, a 40-year security, yields 192 basis points over Treasuries, less than initial discussions for about 215 basis points.Eleven companies came forward with bond offerings Monday as issuers looked to sell debt before the Federal Open Market Committee meeting and subsequent rate decision Wednesday. Other notable high-grade issuers were the Hershey Co., which sold $750 million in bonds and Comcast Corp., which was out with a $5 billion, four-part deal. Over $22 billion was set to price on the day.The scope of issuance in the wake of JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s rescue of First Republic Corp. stands in contrast to the reaction seen in the primary market to the banking crisis that began unfolding in March. Days after Silicon Valley Bank’s collapse, at least eight potential issuers stood down. The fallout led to March issuance coming in at about $100 billion, well below projections of $150 billion.Meta raised $10 billion in its first ever corporate bond issue last year. The Facebook parent plans to use the fresh funds to help finance capital expenditures, repurchase outstanding shares of its common stock, and for acquisitions or investments, the person added.Bank of America Corp., JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley were the bookrunners on Meta’s deal.The Menlo Park, California-based company has spent the last months cutting costs and restructuring its workforce, while advertising sales rebounded in the first quarter. Even though it touts strong cash flow, the company is likely looking to shore up extra cash for future bond buybacks, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Robert Schiffman.“After it boosted repurchase authorization by $40 billion in January, we envision shareholder returns will keep growing — similar to Alphabet and Apple — as free-cash-flow prospects improve,” he wrote in a note. “With initial price talk wide to peers, we perceive little credit risk and strong relative value out the curve.”Representatives for Meta did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Comcast declined to comment.

META,"What's Not Working for Mark Zuckerberg's Meta? Employee Morale, Metaverse and TikTok Struggles Tilt Scales","Reports indicate Zuckerberg has lost his vision and the trust of his workforce amid its record layoffs and costly investment in the virtual reality ""metaverse"" with no immediate signs of paying off.Meta insiders say the layoffs and pledges for further cost-cutting have shattered internal resolve. Even the highest ranks of Meta's leadership, including Chief Technology Officer Andrew Bosworth, blame Zuckerberg for the company's woes.Meta grew its employee ranks by double-digit percentage points for years, which accelerated during the pandemic. The headcount nearly doubled between 2019 and 2022 as Meta benefited from an influx of brands using Facebook and Instagram to reach customers. But the performance of e-commerce reversed on pandemic recovery.Meta's metaverse products also failed to gain traction. The rebranding could not make a mark leading to the dumping of certain products. Reality Labs lost more than $13.7 billion last year — up from the $10.2 billion it lost in 2021 and the $6.6 billion in 2020.John Carmack, the former high-ranking consultant for the company's virtual reality division, quit in December after failing to fix the inefficiencies plaguing the division.By early 2022, Meta's optimism started to fade as Meta's flagship app, Facebook, lost daily users as a public company for the first time in its decade, leading to stock price loss. The losses followed Meta's plans to downsize, triggering alarm among Facebook's workforce.""I got this wrong. It was a big mistake,"" Zuckerberg said at the same meeting, referring to his overestimating revenue. ""Going forward — what this means — is we have to be a leaner and more capital-efficient company.""Meta is now in the midst of its second round of layoffs, eliminating 4,000 jobs in May. Since November, Meta has said it would lay off 21,000 employees, or nearly a quarter of its workforce.At a town hall this month, Zuckerberg delivered a forceful justification of why workers should stay at the company..© 2023 Benzinga.com.

META,Corporate America Focuses on Cost Cuts and Layoffs Not Growth,"(Bloomberg) -- Wall Street’s worries about Corporate America’s dwindling profit margins appear to have made their way to the C-suite based on earnings reports so far this quarter.Most Read from BloombergJPMorgan Ends First Republic’s Turmoil After FDIC SeizureFirst Republic’s Jumbo Mortgages Brought On Bank’s FailureBuffett Will Beat the Market as Recession Looms, Investors SayIBM to Pause Hiring for Jobs That AI Could DoPeak Oil Spells Trouble for ConsumersA few themes are already becoming clear: Cost and job cuts are in, spending and expansion are out. Fears of the impact of rate hikes and a looming economic slowdown have US conglomerates rushing to divert to efficiency from growth mode, and the shift is starting to show up heavily in their financial results.Although only half of the S&P 500 Index has reported results so far, fodder about labor costs in earnings calls has plunged 80% from last quarter, according to data compiled by Bloomberg from corporate earnings calls based on buzzwords like “personnel costs” and “spending on hiring.” The decrease in such mentions is a sign that hiring has come to a halt and reflects the workforce reductions underway.Meta Platforms Inc. Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg spoke extensively about “efficiency” during the company’s first-quarter earnings call, building on a theme the Facebook parent has touted this year alongside a move to lay off 10,000 workers.“As we move forward, including out of the sort of layoffs that we’ve been implementing and the direct restructuring work, we’re going to continue focusing on efficiency work,” Meta Chief Financial Officer Susan Li said during the call last week.Aggressive cost-cutting was a focus of earnings from tech peer Amazon.com Inc., which said Thursday that operating expenses rose 8.7% during the quarter, the slowest pace in at least a decade. The company delivered its latest round of layoffs Wednesday, with recent job cuts totaling 27,000 for the biggest pullback in the company’s history.“Amazon made major strides to reduce its cost to serve within its retail network, which we expect will continue through 2023 and 2024 as more efficiencies are realized,” Arun Sundaram, an equity analyst at CFRA, said in an email. “Overall, we view Q1 as the beginning of a multi-year turnaround in terms of profits and margins.”Meanwhile, efficiency and improving profits are also poised to be a theme when Lyft Inc. reports its results May 4. The ride-hailing company revealed in a regulatory filing it plans to eliminate a quarter of its workforce, more than 1,000 employees and 250 job openings.“It is all about rightsizing to revenue growth,” Jim Tierney, CIO of Concentrated US Growth at AllianceBernstein, said. “The cost cuts are out of necessity in an attempt to preserve operating margins.”Spending will return when revenue growth reaccelerates, he added.“We saw some glimmers of hope on this front from Microsoft and Meta, but AWS at Amazon saw a further revenue slowdown in April from the 1Q levels, so the picture is mixed,” Tierney said. “The cuts were incredibly effective with most companies significantly exceeding earnings expectations, and with the stock prices generally going up, management has to see that investors are rewarding profitability rather than pure growth, so I’d expect the belt tightening to continue for a while.”And while tech names have been the most bloated after splurging on hiring during the pandemic, it’s certainly not the only sector working to reduce expenses as economic conditions change. Post-it Notes maker 3M Co. said last week it was slashing another 6,000 jobs as part of ongoing restructuring to curb costs. Retail giant Gap Inc. in recent days revealed plans to cut 1,800 workers in an effort to return to profitability amid waning sales. And Lazard Ltd. on Friday became the latest Wall Street bank to reduce headcount, announcing plans to trim its workforce by 10% as it reported a surprise loss in its earnings.“Corporate America is great on the front end in terms of staying ahead of the competition with robust hiring, but they’re also quick to counter that trend and lean down to support and protect the bottom line of their margins,” Robert Schein, chief investment officer at Blanke Schein Wealth Management, said. “We’re seeing a lot of that play out in the earnings calls we’ve seen in recent days.”Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekA Tax Loophole Makes EV Leasing a No-Brainer in the USWhy Chinese Banks Aren’t Worried About Depositors FleeingAt Charles Schwab, Being a Big Bank Has Become a Big ProblemGood Luck Paying for Those $10,000 Obesity Drugs Everyone’s Talking AboutMore Companies Head to Space, But No One Can Agree on the Rules Up There©2023 Bloomberg L.P.","May 1, 2023 at 11:10 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/corporate-america-focuses-cost-cuts-161032874.html,Bloomberg,0.0,0.0,0.12737734487734487,0.42730880230880236

META,What we'll be asking CEOs about this week: Morning Brief,"It's game on at the posh Beverly Hilton today for the Yahoo Finance team as the 26th annual Milken Institute Global Conference gets underway.This year’s Milken Institute Global Conference will be set against a busy backdrop of happenings for investors to keep in mind (even if the major indices are overlooking them all...).Rising interest rates (Fed decision is on May 3) will be top of mind at the conference, too, as the Fed is expected to raise rates by 25 basis points despite the banking troubles.Meanwhile, the U.S. economy is slowing in part because of those rate hikes — Morgan Stanley economist Ellen Zentner is looking for a 0.4% decline in second quarter GDP, for example.And then a U.S. presidential election looms in 2024 as we saw in the Twitter video drop from president Joe Biden last week. The ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine may just be endless, experts have told me recently.All of this will be front and center for power brokers from inside governments around the world and Corporate America at the Milken conference. I can tell you as well there will be a ton of AI talk, which comes after a ton of AI talk last week from Microsoft, Google, Meta and Snap. I suspect Apple will chime in on AI when it reports earnings on May 4.Our job there as Yahoo Finance journalists is rather straightforward: bring investors on our platform inside this world of big ideas and potentially market-moving insights.

META,Top 5 Momentum Stocks for May Amid Fed's FOMC Meeting,"Wall Street completed last month on a positive note despite volatility. In April, the Dow advanced 2.5%, marking its best month since January. The S&P 500 gained 1.5%, finishing the second positive month in a row.The Nasdaq Composite also rose marginally despite a weak start. The tech-heavy index regained momentum last week supported by strong first-quarter earnings of big techs. Last week, the Nasdaq Composite ended 1.3% higher, while the Dow and the S&P 500 rose 0.9% each.The momentum of the U.S. stock markets is likely to sustain in May. The major driver of this month will be the Fed’s FOMC meeting and the first-quarter 2023 earnings season.The Fed is scheduled to meet its FOMC meeting on May 2 and 3. In the post-FOMC statement in March, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said that the central bank is approaching the end of its ongoing interest rate hike regime. The terminal rate is likely to be 5.125%, which means just one 25 basis-point rate hike from the existing range of 4.75-5%.Per the CME FedWatch, there exists an 85.5% probability of a 25-basis point rate hike while a 14.5% probability for the central bank to maintain the status quo for the benchmark lending rate. In March, Powell said that no reduction in the Fed fund rate is expected before 2024. However, at present 77.2% of respondents are expecting a rate reduction by late 2023.U.S. corporates have presented relatively good earnings results so far despite the threat of a recession later this year.As of Apr 28, 267 companies on the S&P 500 Index have reported their quarterly financial numbers. Total earnings of these companies are down 2.4% year over year on 4.1% higher revenues. Further, 77.2% of companies have surpassed earnings estimates while 73% have surpassed revenue estimates.Our projection has shown that total earnings of the S&P 500 Index are set to decline 5.7% year over year on 2.8% higher revenues compared with a 10% year-over-year decline in earnings on 1.7% higher revenues, estimated at the beginning of the reporting cycle. This will follow a 5.4% year-over-year decline in earnings of the S&P 500 Index on 5.9% higher revenues in fourth-quarter 2022.The chart below shows the price performance of our five picks in the past month.However, as developed regions mature, Meta Platforms has taken measures to drive penetration in emerging markets of South East Asia, Latin America and Africa. Of all places, India deserves a-special mention in terms of user growth. The world’s second-largest populated country offers tremendous potential for META.

META,How To Grow a Sustainability Pilot Into Reality at Scale,"Originally published on TriplePundit.comTo drive innovation and efficiency beyond these high standards, our team has multiple pilot programs in various stages of pursuit and delivery. They vary from experimenting with low-carbon concrete and tracking the circular economy of materials, to testing the feasibility of an all-electric construction vehicle fleet and sourcing alternative fuel sources. Yet they are united by one goal: to create future data centers on the cutting edge of performance and sustainability.A successful pilot means not only securing buy-in from internal stakeholders, along with funding and manpower, but also mapping a path to applicability and scalability across the enterprise. When it comes to determining whether a pilot is viable, our team begins with a five-factor framework:In 2021, we proposed HVO (hydrogenated vegetable oil) as a carbon-saving alternative to diesel for construction equipment at one of our European facilities. The site had regional availability of the fuel type, plus the application and contractor partner were deemed a good fit. Ultimately, timing and cost made the pilot too challenging to pursue. Fortunately, our team's extensive analysis on HVO provided the solid promise for a future opportunity with a greater understanding of a successful pilot proposal and further refinement of stakeholder engagement, as well as a new Risk Registry tool to identify potential risks in a project that can derail intended outcomes.It's true that the carbon footprint during the data center construction phase can often be overlooked. To offset this, we work with our general contractors to communicate ways to reduce (and eliminate) the barriers to going green on a typical job site. Meta's general contractors now implement technologies and processes for more efficient builds, linking to carbon reductions with partners and circularity in our materials. At our Altoona, Iowa, site, we are upscaling onsite tracking to include both construction and operational waste (as well as using hybrid-fuel construction equipment). It's just one combination leading our builds to greater, sustainable impact.Thanks to our robust and vetted piloting program, along with engaged stakeholders, we are able to build with successful social and environmental impacts while providing opportunities to integrate new technologies and strategies across our portfolio. We minimize risks across our facilities by testing ideas - whether a change in design or construction, or even a process - and gain wider acceptance before rolling it out for wide-scale application.And thus, our work toward greater performance and sustainability continues to build.This article series is sponsored by Meta.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Meta on 3blmedia.com.","May 1, 2023 at 9:30 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/grow-sustainability-pilot-reality-scale-143000313.html,ACCESSWIRE,0.0,0.0,0.19036907536907535,0.4967715617715617

META,"Here is What to Know Beyond Why Meta Platforms, Inc. (META) is a Trending Stock","Shares of this social media company have returned +13.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +5.1% change. The Zacks Internet - Software industry, to which Meta Platforms belongs, has gained 5.5% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Meta Platforms is expected to post earnings of $2.74 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +11.4%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +16.4%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $11.34 points to a change of +15.4% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +11%.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $14.27 indicates a change of +25.8% from what Meta Platforms is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +10.6%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for Meta Platforms.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Meta Platforms, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $30.26 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +5%. For the current and next fiscal years, $126.66 billion and $139.59 billion estimates indicate +8.6% and +10.2% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryMeta Platforms reported revenues of $28.65 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +2.6%. EPS of $2.64 for the same period compares with $2.72 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $27.49 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +4.21%. The EPS surprise was +34.69%.Over the last four quarters, Meta Platforms surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Meta Platforms is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Meta Platforms. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Meta Platforms, Inc.

Currently, many banks avoid working with marijuana companies due to the industry's illegal status at the federal level. This has led to a reliance on cash transactions, making it difficult for cannabis businesses to access loans, lines of credit, and other essential financial services. If passed, the SAFE Banking Act would level the playing field for marijuana businesses in states where cannabis, facilitating growth and attracting investment (read: SAFE Banking Act Resurgence Boosts Pot ETFs: A New Era Ahead?).Existing US home sales fell 2.4% sequentially to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.44 million in March of 2023, compared to market forecasts of 4.5 million.

META,What are the biggest names in tech doing on AI?,"AI-powered chatbots, cloud services and tools for web developers are among the tools that are quickly becoming staple offerings of tech companies. Major U.S. tech firms – including Amazon, Google, Meta and Microsoft – have each rolled out AI initiatives or have some in the works, although Apple has been notably quiet in announcing any big AI moves to date.Here’s a look at the major public-facing AI initiatives at four of the biggest tech companies:THESE JOBS ARE SAFE FROM THE AI REVOLUTION – FOR NOWThe integration of OpenAI’s latest AI technology into Bing gives users more relevant search results, summarizes answers and facilitates complex searches through its chat function. In the Edge browser, users can use chat and composition functionalities to summarize or draft content. Both Bing and Edge have seen uptick in usage since the AI integrations were released.READ ON THE FOX BUSINESS APPThe company has also updated its cloud platform to incorporate the new AI technologies. Microsoft’s Azure OpenAI Service became generally available in January and was updated to feature ChatGPT-4 in March.GOOGLE, MICROSOFT IN Q1 EARNINGS PROVIDE UPDATES ON AI PUSHGoogle is yet to roll out new AI integrations for its search engine and its Chrome web browser, although changes to search could be on the way.Google CEO Sundar Pichai spoke at an earnings call last week about AI-related search and said, ""We will continue to incorporate generative AI advances to make search better in a thoughtful and deliberate way."" According to the New York Times report, an initial rollout of the AI search integration could occur in May with additional features due sometime this fall.MUSK MEETS WITH SCHUMER, DISCUSSES AI, THE ECONOMY, AND ‘THE FUTURE’In particular, he noted the company is ""exploring"" several types of AI integrations, including:Chatbots for WhatsApp and Messenger.Video and multi-modal experiences.Zuckerberg said he expects that ""a lot of interest in AI agents for business messaging and customer support will come once we nail that experience."" He added, ""Over time this will extend to our work on the metaverse too, where people will much more easily be able to create avatars, objects, worlds, and code to tie all them together.""AMAZON ANNOUNCES NEW CUSTOMIZABLE AI MODELS FOR CLOUD CUSTOMERSAI21 Labs includes multilingual language-learning models (LLMs) from the Jurassic-2 family which can follow natural language instructions to generate text in Spanish, French, German, Portuguese, Italian and Dutch.Anthropic’s LLM called Claude can perform conversational and text-processing tasks based on the company’s research into AI systems.Stability AI offers text-to-image foundational models, including Stable Diffusion, which can generate unique and realistic high-quality images, art, logos and designs.Bedrock users will have access to two Amazon Titan LLMs. The first can do tasks like classification, information extraction, open-ended question and answers, summarization and text generation.

META,"Amazon, Alphabet, Apple, Meta and Microsoft are part of Zacks Earnings Preview","Chicago, IL – May 1, 2023 – Zacks.com releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises. This week’s list includes Amazon AMZN, Alphabet GOOGL, Apple AAPL, Meta META and Microsoft MSFT.All of these stocks have been standout performers in 2023. Meta Platforms’ shares were in a league of their own regarding stock market performance, which got a further boost following the Q1 results. The magnitude of the positive reaction to Microsoft’s results wasn’t nearly as strong as it was for Meta, but it was nevertheless very favorable. Amazon and Alphabet shares lost ground following their quarterly releases, although they both exceeded estimates.The key differentiator among Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet are trends in their respective cloud businesses and the perceived headway that each of them is making on the artificial intelligence (AI) front.The market likes what it is seeing and hearing from Microsoft on both of these fronts and appears somewhat unconvinced of Alphabet and Amazon’s AI efforts. We all know that cloud spending is coming down, but Microsoft is not only seen as gaining share at the expense of Amazon Web Services but is also perceived as getting a growth boost from its AI capabilities.Looking at the ‘Big 5 Tech Players’ as a whole, combining estimates for Apple with actual results from the others that have reported already, total Q1 earnings for the group are expected to be down -2.5% on +3.8% higher revenues. This is significantly better than the -11.2% decline in earnings on +1.9% higher revenues expected just a week back ahead of these results.A better-than-expected showing from Apple this week, which is expected to bring in -9.1% lower earnings in Q1 on -4.1% lower revenues, could potentially push the group’s growth rate into positive territory.With top-line growth hard to come by due to macro factors, the group has responded to the market’s persistent worries about cost controls by announcing payroll reductions. There is a general feeling in the market that all of them could do more on that front, but their steps are nevertheless helping stabilize their margins picture.Net margins for the group were down -458 basis points in 2022 but are expected to modestly nudge higher in 2023 and improve further in 2024. That said, current net margins embedded in consensus estimates for the next two years remain below the 2021 level. That said, the 2023 net margin estimate of 18% for the group is above the pre-Covid 2019 level of 17.6%.Beyond the big 5 Tech players, total Q1 earnings for the Technology sector as a whole are expected to be down -13.2% from the same period last year on -3.6% lower revenues.This big-picture view of the ‘Big 5’ players and the sector as a whole highlight the earnings growth challenge at present. The Tech space is expected to resume its growth-engine status from next year onwards.Regular readers of our earnings commentary know that we have been referring to the overall picture emerging from the Q1 earnings season as good enough; not great, but not bad either. With results from more than half of the S&P 500 members already out, we can confidently say that corporate earnings aren’t headed towards the ‘cliff’ that market bears were warning us of.The way we see it, the ‘better-than-feared’ view of the Q1 earnings season at this stage may be a bit unfair, given how resilient corporate profitability has turned out to be. But the view isn’t entirely off the mark either.We have a super busy reporting docket this week, with almost 1150 companies reporting Q1 results, including 159 S&P 500 members. In addition to the aforementioned earnings release from Apple, this week’s docket has representation from every sector of the economy.Below, we compare the Q1 results thus far from what we have seen from this same group of 90 index members in other recent periods.2023 Q1 earnings are expected to be down -5.7% on +2.8% higher revenues. This would follow the -5.4% earnings decline in the preceding period (2022 Q4) on +5.9% higher revenues.Embedded in these 2023 Q1 earnings and revenue growth projections is the expectation of continued margin pressures, a recurring theme in recent quarters.Actual results are proving a lot better on the margins front relative to what was expected ahead of the releases.Estimates for Q1 came down as the quarter got underway, in line with the trend that had been in place since the start of 2022. That said, the magnitude of negative revisions to Q1 estimates was smaller relative to what we had seen in the preceding two periods.Estimates for full-year 2023 have also been coming down as well, as we have been pointing out consistently in these pages.For a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report >>>>2023 Q1 Earnings: Good Enough, but not Great  See Stocks Free >>Join us on Facebook:  https://www.facebook.com/ZacksInvestmentResearch/Zacks Investment Research is under common control with affiliated entities (including a broker-dealer and an investment adviser), which may engage in transactions involving the foregoing securities for the clients of such affiliates.Media ContactZacks Investment Research800-767-3771 ext. 9339support@zacks.comhttps://www.zacks.comZacks.com provides investment resources and informs you of these resources, which you may choose to use in making your own investment decisions.

CRM,3 Tech Titans Set to Break Out,"Tech Stocks Climb the Wall of WorryHowever, despite the fear-mongering from many investors and the underperformance in some regions of the market, tech has marched higher in a stair-stepping fashion thus far in 2023. Currently, it is in the process of breaking out.In early February, GOOGL shares tanked more than 10% after its AI chatbot Bard, made a mistake in its public-facing demo. While it was not a good look for the company or the stock, bargain hunters used the sell-off as an opportunity to accumulate shares. Last week, in a show of conviction, insiders scooped up a cool $20 million worth of the company’s stock. GOOGL is a mega-cap tech name that will essentially track the Q’s but should outperform to the upside over the next 6-12 months.Despite Oracle’s massive size, it is not talked about as much as stocks such as Microsoft or Amazon Oracle is not as “sexy” as these companies; however, it produces a ton of revenue and is a dominant player in its space. Furthermore, though Oracle has a beta of just 1 (the same volatility as the S&P 500 Index), it has outperformed 92% of stocks. Low volatility and high returns are the combination that makes for an excellent addition to any portfolio. Last week, Oracle broke out of a classic bull flag pattern on expanding volume.Beyond a resumption of strong growth, CRM is very attractive from a valuation perspective. CRM’s P/E ratio of ~37 is the lowest in at least ten years.Technically, the stock is consolidating in a bullish manner as it approaches its 50-day moving average for the first time since breaking out earlier this year. The first pullback to the 50-day moving average should offer investors a low-risk entry point and give them a chance to gain a cushion in the stock before it reports earnings at the end of the month.Amazon.com, Inc.

CRM,Here is What to Know Beyond Why Salesforce Inc. (CRM) is a Trending Stock,"Over the past month, shares of this customer-management software developer have returned -0.1%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -0.9% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Software industry, which Salesforce.com falls in, has gained 3.1%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Salesforce.com is expected to post earnings of $1.61 per share, indicating a change of +64.3% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +1.2% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.11 points to a change of +35.7% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.76 indicates a change of +23.3% from what Salesforce.com is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.4%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Salesforce.com is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Salesforce.com, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $8.17 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +10.2%. For the current and next fiscal years, $34.62 billion and $38.48 billion estimates indicate +10.4% and +11.1% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistorySalesforce.com reported revenues of $8.38 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +14.4%. EPS of $1.68 for the same period compares with $0.84 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.99 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +4.99%. The EPS surprise was +24.44%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Salesforce.com is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Salesforce.com. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Salesforce Inc.

The success it achieved during the pandemic establishes it as a fundamental necessity for corporate communication services even after pandemic restrictions are lifted.Zoom is reaping the rewards of shifts in personal communication. While mobile phone service remains indispensable, cloud-based video interactions may challenge conventional telecommunications companies in the future. As internet access broadens, maintaining connections could increasingly lean toward cloud software providers, sidelining traditional phone companies.However, there is one thing worth noting before investing in Zoom stock. Undoubtedly, the company enjoyed exemplary years during the pandemic. As a result, the markets also helped the stock flourish. But, as of press time, shares find themselves down almost 100% from their all-time high.A momentum slowdown may be worrisome, but it’s essential to consider the bigger picture. The pandemic demonstrated that remote work and maintaining productivity are feasible for many organizations. This bodes well for Zoom’s long-term prospects, making a valuation adjustment beneficial for investors.Faizan Farooque is a contributing author for InvestorPlace.com and numerous other financial sites.

So could you maybe just speak to the pipeline that you talked about, how much of that leasing that you're in discussions on is for the development? And I guess, how do you still feel about the projected yields on the development pipeline today?Douglas T. LindeOperatorNext question in the queue comes from the line of John Kim from BMO Capital Markets.John P. KimYou discussed extending some of your maturities on your JV mortgage debt and debt market overall, the mortgage market being inside bond pricing currently, which really goes against the grain of some of the issues we're hearing with the regional banks. I was wondering if you could just elaborate on how healthy that market is and who's willing to put more capital into office assets today.Michael E. LaBelleDouglas T. LindeOperatorAnd I show our next question comes from the line of Camille Bonnel from Bank of America.Jing Xian Tan BonnelFollowing up on the leasing pipeline, can you please comment on how you classify deals in the active proposal pipeline? And how this pipeline compared to last quarter or even a year ago?Douglas T. LindeOperatorAnd I show our next question comes from the line of Anthony Paolone from JPMorgan.Anthony PaoloneYes. So I appreciate all the color on capital markets and how you're trying to triangulate where pricing might be. But just for BXP for you to put capital out the door right now, what would you all want in terms of an IRR, how would you underwrite rents and cash flow growth? Like what would a deal that would prompt you to pull the trigger on look like?Owen David ThomasOperatorAnd I show our next question comes from the line of Alexander Goldfarb from Piper Sandler.Alexander David GoldfarbOwen David ThomasAlex, we have access to capital, as Mike and I pointed out and the key is pricing. We're interested. We're open for business. We're interested in growing our company. We think we will. But that's -- that 9% look through cap rate is a guidepost for us.OperatorAnd I show our next question comes from the line of Nick Yulico from Scotiabank.Nicholas Philip YulicoDouglas T. LindeOperatorAnd I show our next question comes from the line of Blaine Heck from Wells Fargo.Blaine Matthew HeckDoug, your commentary around the most active tenant groups in the market was really helpful. Can you guys just talk about how you're taking advantage of that activity amongst medium and small financial and professional services companies. Are you breaking down any of your vacant spaces into smaller spec suites or doing anything else to accommodate that demand from small tenants?Douglas T. LindeSo the answer is we are, and we are seeing, I would say, very deliberate about the kinds of things we're doing. I'll let Bob talk, for example, about some of the activities we have going on in San Francisco right now, where what was put in front of me was a series of changes to some existing availability that we think will be very additive to the market. Bob, do you want to talk about our approach there?Robert E. PesterSure. We have a program of doing spec suites at Embarcadero Center on the smaller spaces, and we have several that are in the works right now. And some of them are designed, where they can be combined with other suites that we need larger space. And typically, when we do these turnkey, we might have to put a little bit of TI in after the fact when we find a tenant. But we've had great success with these smaller suites so far.Douglas T. LindeAnd Pete, maybe you can -- you or Ray can comment on the program we've had in Reston, Virginia for probably the last 7 years and how successful that's been.Peter V. OtteniOperatorAnd our next question comes from the line of Caitlin Burrows from Goldman Sachs.Caitlin BurrowsMaybe just another one on leasing. In the quarter, you did 660,000 square feet of leasing and have talked about now an expectation for about 750,000 square feet per quarter the rest of the year. So I was just wondering, are you seeing activity that specifically points to an increase in leasing activity in 2Q and beyond? And if so, what and kind of where is that? Or is it more of a general expectation at this point?Douglas T. LindeOperatorOur next question comes from the line of Michael Griffin from Citi.Michael Anderson GriffinMaybe we just shift back to San Francisco, down the Peninsula probably better off submarket, to be curious to get your thoughts about Google announcing the pause on that mega campus in San Jose. Could you see this being a potential benefit for that Platform 16 project? I think it's not expected to be stabilized til 2026. I know you have a relationship with Google. So any comments you can make there would be helpful.Douglas T. LindeSure. Bob, do you want to take that one?Robert E. PesterSure. First off, the CNBC report that came out the other day that they were stopping the project is false news. It's been reported by the mayor on Friday and Google yesterday that they're still planning on proceeding with the project today -- or excuse me, this year. We do have a relationship with Google, whether or not they would have interest in that project remains to be seen. But we will be the first building out of the ground adjacent to their campus. So time will tell. They're several years away from actually starting a building because they've got to put all the infrastructure in place person.OperatorAnd I show our next question comes from the line of Vikram Malhotra from Mizuho.Vikram L. MalhotraJust 2 quick ones. So one, can you just remind us, are there any risks sort of with your -- I think you have 3 or 4 rework leases in terms of just their performance and potentially being those being given back. And then just separately, broadly, I know you had embarked on -- over time, you've been investing CapEx to kind of keep the buildings fresh. And I'm just wondering sort of in this environment, can you remind us sort of what the sort of CapEx outlay may look like over this, call it, the next 2 years to keep the buildings competitive?Douglas T. LindeOperatorAnd I show our next question comes from the line of Ronald Kamdem from Morgan Stanley.Ronald KamdemDouglas T. LindeOwen David ThomasI would just add, we have -- Bob should comment on this. We have market inquiries relatively frequently for the Salesforce Tower, and it's completely full. And one of the reasons Salesforce is putting floors in the tower on the market is because it's actually the easiest space they have sublease given the attractiveness of the asset.Robert E. PesterYes. I would just add, the building is 100% leased. It's probably the most sought after building in San Francisco for space and we get multiple inquiries every month about people looking for space in the building.OperatorAnd I show our next question comes from the line of Dylan Burzinski from Green Street.Dylan Robert BurzinskiJust curious how you guys are thinking about buybacks or potential buybacks in the current environment. Owen, you mentioned the 9% implied cap rate that the stock now trades at today. And I realize that obviously, office transaction markets are fairly illiquid. But if you guys were able to get dispositions to the finish line, would you guys view buybacks the potential use of that capital?Owen David ThomasWell, we think that our stock represents a very uniquely interesting investment, particularly at this point in time. Most of the inquiries we've been getting recently, and that's the reason why Mike and I spent so much time on it in our remarks is our access to capital and how are we dealing with upcoming debt maturities and things like that. So in this kind of environment, buybacks are not a priority for us. And we also -- we have found interesting uses for the capital. We just put on our development pipeline this quarter. The 290 Binney Street development that's 100% leased to AstraZeneca and also the 300 Binney Street asset conversion.OperatorAnd I show our next question comes from the line of Tayo Okusanya from Credit Suisse.Omotayo Tejamude OkusanyaJust a quick one on office to resi conversion. Again, a lot of these buildings don't compete with your assets. So just curious how you guys think about that for movement? Is it something that you're excited about? Do you think it helps BXP longer term? Or just because it's not competitive product doesn't really matter to you guys?Owen David ThomasDouglas T. LindeYes. And this is Doug. I would just add that Worldgate is sort of an illustrative example of what we think may happen in certain instances in certain cities where the buildings have no intrinsic value as a repositioned conversion, and therefore, the land is really where the value is, and it probably has a higher and better use as residential. And so there are buildings probably that will be taken down and the sites will be then readapted as residential sites even though they're currently commercial office buildings.Helen HanWhy don't we circle back to Hilary on 360 Park? Hilary?Hilary J. SpannThanks, Helen. Can you guys hear me now?Owen David ThomasYes. Got it.Hilary J. SpannOperatorI'm showing no further questions in the queue. At this time, I would like to turn the call back over to Owen Thomas, CEO, for closing remarks.Owen David ThomasJust want to thank everyone for your time, attention and interest in BXP. That concludes the call.OperatorThank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for attending. You may all disconnect at this time.","April 27, 2023 at 3:53 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/q1-2023-boston-properties-inc-085338432.html,Thomson Reuters StreetEvents,0.0,0.0,0.13228382261995705,0.3875063661828368

CRM,Is Salesforce (CRM) a Resilient Stock to Invest in?,"Polen Focus Growth Strategy made the following comment about Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:While we have long admired Salesforce’s market leading enterprise software across several cloud offerings, we have also believed that the company’s cost structure was bloated. We applaud management’s decision to become a more streamlined and profitable business without sacrificing product development efforts, especially as we also continue to expect healthy revenue growth over the coming five years. The investment case for companies that have solid revenue growth along with disciplined expense management and strong capital allocation can often be, in our experience, a strong combination. And, if it also happens to include accelerating revenue growth and a highly attractive valuation, it can provide for unusually strong shareholder returns.

No Reality Lab goggles out of Meta that will also help walk your adorable puppy by saying ""walk adorable puppy."" No new Alexa feature that will allow you to write a will while standing in line for a heart-pounding extra caffeinated coffee (or maybe...).My guy Ives is likely right on the favorable setup simply by looking at the deep cost cuts taken by scores of big tech names in under a year.Meta, for example, said last week it will layoff 10,000 people. That's on top of 11,000 layoffs enacted back in November 2022. Lyft said late Friday it will slash another 1,200 jobs. Last November, Lyft sent 13% of its workforce packing.These companies are among the likes of Microsoft and Salesforce laying off thousands of people as tech finds religion on expense management.More mass layoffs for the space are probably ahead, too.

CRM,Is Trending Stock Salesforce Inc. (CRM) a Buy Now?,"Over the past month, shares of this customer-management software developer have returned +4.7%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.3% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Software industry, which Salesforce.com falls in, has gained 4.6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Salesforce.com is expected to post earnings of $1.61 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +64.3%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.11 points to a change of +35.7% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.76 indicates a change of +23.3% from what Salesforce.com is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.5%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Salesforce.com is rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Salesforce.com, the consensus sales estimate of $8.17 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +10.2%. The $34.62 billion and $38.48 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +10.4% and +11.1%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistorySalesforce.com reported revenues of $8.38 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +14.4%. EPS of $1.68 for the same period compares with $0.84 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.99 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +4.99%. The EPS surprise was +24.44%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Salesforce.com is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Salesforce.com. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Salesforce Inc.

Starting back in the middle of the third quarter of 2022, we saw our year-over-year growth rates slow as enterprises of all sizes evaluated ways to optimize their cloud spending in response to the tough macroeconomic conditions.As expected, these optimization efforts continued into the fourth quarter. Some of the key benefits of being in the cloud compared to managing your own data center are the ability to handle large demand swings and to optimize costs relatively quickly, especially during times of economic uncertainty. Our customers are looking for ways to save money, and we spend a lot of our time trying to help them do so. This customer focus is in our DNA and informs how we think about our customer relationships and how we will partner with them for the long term. As we look ahead, we expect these optimization efforts will continue to be a headwind to AWS growth in at least the next couple of quarters. So far in the first month of the year, AWS year-over-year revenue growth is in the mid-teens.That said, stepping back, our new customer pipeline remains healthy and robust, and there are many customers continuing to put plans in place to migrate to the cloud and commit to AWS over the long term.AI Generated ImageOur Methodology Latest Market Capitalization: $10.23 billion Samsara Inc.

The other tool, Data Cloud for Flow, uses data-driven event triggers to drive actions in Flow.The underlying model is a blend of available models, including those from OpenAI, Google, and Meta and their models, and combining these with the Einstein intelligence layer the company has been working on since 2016, according to Doyle.The tooling will likely go into early beta release in June, with a final release in 2024.In March, Salesforce launched Einstein GPT to integrate OpenAI with Tableau, MuleSoft, and Slack..© 2023 Benzinga.com.

CRM,Salesforce Stock Looks Ready to Topple Technical Ceiling,"A historically bullish signal now flashing could help CRM topple that aforementioned ceiling and add to its 49.1% year-to-date lead. According to Schaeffer's Quantitative Analyst Rocky White, the equity's recent rally comes amid historically low implied volatility (IV), which has been a bullish combination for the shares in the past.White's data shows four other signals during the last five years when the security was trading within 2% of its 52-week high, while its Schaeffer's Volatility Index (SVI) sat in the 20th percentile of its annual range or lower. This is now the case with Salesforce stock's SVI of 26%, which sits in the 1st percentile of its annual range.One month after these signals, shares were higher 75% of the time, averaging a 4.6% pop. From its current perch, a move of similar magnitude would put CRM at $207.01 -- another one-year high.While the brokerage bunch is already optimistic toward CRM, there's still plenty of room for upgrades, which would generate  additional tailwinds. Of the 37 analysts in question, 13 still rate the security a ""hold"" or worse.","April 18, 2023 at 10:56 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/salesforce-stock-looks-ready-topple-155619997.html,Schaeffer&#39;s Investment Research,0.1,0.3,-0.008846153846153846,0.26397435897435895
CRM,Corporate volunteerism: 'Not charity. It's good business.',"“A leader calling up the nonprofit saying, ‘Hey, I have 20 people that can be over there in an hour. What do you want them to do?’ That’s not helpful,” said Kari Niedfeldt-Thomas, managing director of corporate insights and engagement at Chief Executives for Corporate Purpose, which advises companies on sustainability and corporate responsibility issues.“What you want is for those volunteers to be part of an ongoing engagement, so those volunteers become embedded in the community,” she said. “They understand better what those participants needs are and they truly are then approaching their volunteerism work not as ‘I’m helping you,’’ but with a lens of ‘We’re in a partnership about making our community a better place.’ That levels the playing field. It doesn’t make it charity. It makes it a relationship.”It’s the kind of relationship that more and more corporations are trying to cultivate with their philanthropy.Tech giant Salesforce is a high-profile example of that connection, with its wide range of volunteer programs and funding initiatives that focus on education and workforce development, as well as climate and community resilience.Ron C. Smith, Salesforce’s vice president of philanthropy, said giving back has always been in the company’s DNA, along with innovation.“You have to be willing to hear what the community you live in — or the community you want to support — is asking for,” Smith said. “We start with the question ‘What can we do?’ or ‘How can we help?’ Then, we align to their strategic plans.”The company is part of the Pledge 1% movement, where corporations promise to donate 1% of their equity, time, products and profit. Salesforce often supports nonprofits through several of those donation types, often stacking them as its relationship with the group grows.Salesforce’s partnership with The Marcy Lab School, for example, began when some of its employees started volunteering at the New York nonprofit that trains high school graduates to become software engineers in one year at no cost to the students. Then, Salesforce started providing the school access to some of its software and is now looking at hiring some of the school’s graduates.Last year, The Marcy Lab School became one of the first grantees of Salesforce’s Catalyst Fund, which provided $100,000 to emerging nonprofits that were led by a person of color and had operating budgets under $2 million annually.Reuben Ogbonna, co-founder of The Marcy Lab School, said the Catalyst Fund allowed the nonprofit to nearly double its student body from 30 to 50. Students accepted at the school pay no tuition and receive a free laptop for their studies. Most graduates land jobs at top tech companies as software programmers, with starting salaries over $100,000.“What was most interesting about it was that they were making bets on organizations that typically don’t get on the radar of a big funder like Salesforce,” Ogbonna said. “And what I appreciated about Salesforce is that there was this acknowledgment that our organization already had the seeds of competitiveness and impact.”Ogbonna said Salesforce hasn’t exhibited the signs of doubt that other major funders have over whether an emerging nonprofit can handle a substantial donation properly. Instead, he says, Salesforce volunteers are helping make Marcy Lab School’s curriculum even stronger.Marcy Lab School’s other co-founder Maya Bhattacharjee said that its impressive 16,000 square-foot campus in an 11th-floor loft space in Brooklyn, New York’s Industry City neighborhood, with views of the Statue of Liberty across New York Harbor was “beyond our wildest dreams.”But their training program is exactly how they envisioned it. “I always dreamed of building a school that was just filled with a lot of love for students,” Bhattacharjee said. “Teachers are not thinking about students as numbers or test scores or things that needed to be fixed. To have educators around a table working to have programs work for every student is everything I dreamed of.”For Enmanuel de la Nuez Carvajal, getting accepted into Marcy Lab School was a dream come true as well. Like a lot of the recent high school graduates who apply to join Marcy Lab School, he felt like he was languishing at LaGuardia Community College. But not everyone was convinced.“Some of my friends were a little skeptical,” said the native of the Dominican Republic. “They said it sounds like it’s too good to be true. But I thought I don’t see how this could go wrong.”After graduating from Marcy Lab School in 2020, de la Nuez Carvajal was hired by the project management software company Asana, where he is currently a software engineer.Those are the kind of results that excite volunteers and keep them engaged to help their communities.Naomi Morenzoni, Salesforce’s vice president of philanthropy strategy, said the company is an outlier in terms of volunteering, with about 87% of its workforce donating time each year. According to Chief Executives for Corporate Purpose, the average volunteer participation rate through company-sponsored initiatives was 17% in 2022.“There’s a sea change that’s happened,” Morenzoni said. “We see that 50% of job seekers won’t take a job if a company doesn’t align with their values. All of that is driving value both for the company and for the community. The two are completely interconnected now.”Salesforce sees its philanthropy program – which provides employees seven days of paid leave to volunteer and a company match for donations up to a $5,000 total each year – as a tool for recruitment and retention.Morenzoni said Salesforce’s internal surveys show that 91% of its volunteering employees feel more engaged in their regular jobs.“This is good for us,” she said. “This is good for our communities. It’s not charity. It’s good business.”Though Salesforce declined comment on the investors’ complaints, officials said the company’s commitment to volunteerism will continue.“I can’t speak to what the investors are looking for,"" Smith said. ""But I know we’re going to continue doing the good work that Salesforce has committed to. And we’re going to make sure that we bring our employees and partners and everyone else along with us – including our investors – so they can see the good work that’s happening.” ____","April 18, 2023 at 5:20 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/corporate-volunteerism-not-charity-good-222029606.html,AP Finance,0.35,0.30000000000000004,0.21973851417399795,0.4450448655287364
CRM,7 Stocks That Hedge Funds Are Dumping Now,"While it’s always important to conduct your own due diligence in the equities arena, there’s great value in understanding which hedge fund stocks to avoid. Put another way, these are the stocks that hedge funds are unloading, which should inspire additional research. Fundamentally, if the enterprises with the greatest access to information don’t believe in the impacted securities, you might not want to either.As well, another reason to carefully monitor stocks that hedge funds are bearish on centers on the folks these investment giants hire. Obviously, they don’t just pick up people randomly off the streets. Rather, we’re talking about some of the brightest, most educated minds on Wall Street. If they don’t like something, you should at least find out why. Again, it’s always important to do your own research first before making a major decision. With that said, the big dogs command a big influence. Therefore, watch out for these potential hedge fund sell-offs.VVisa$233.48MAMastercard$372.76CRMSalesforce$197.08JPMJPMorgan$139.83CICigna$258.67DHRDanaher$255.75ORLYO’Reilly Automotive897.28InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSource: ShutterstockIt’s not entirely clear why the big dogs apparently fell out of favor with Visa. Since the beginning of this year, V stock gained nearly 13% of its equity value. Overall, in the past 365 days, it’s up almost 10%. However, Visa’s viability depends on a robust consumer economy. Therefore, V may be one of the hedge fund stocks to avoid due to recession risks.Source: ShutterstockSource: ShutterstockAgain, it’s tough to discern exactly why CRM stands among the stocks that hedge funds are bearish on. Since the Jan. opener, CRM gained over 44% of equity value. In the trailing year, Salesforce now turns in a positive performance, up 4%. However, it’s possible that the institutional players believe the best is behind the company. Financially, Salesforce benefits from strong operations, particularly its three-year revenue growth rate of 16.1%. However, it does seem overvalued. Currently, the market prices CRM at a trailing multiple of 926.9.Source: ShutterstockLike the other stocks that hedge funds are unloading, JPM actually represents a decent performer. Since the Jan. opener, shares moved up almost 3%. In the past 365 days, they’ve gained 8% of equity value. However, the banking sector fallout didn’t do any favors regarding segment confidence. Therefore, it’s possible that the big dogs wanted to trim their exposure. Still, investors should note that JPM doesn’t necessarily strike as a need-to-dump enterprise. However, the market prices JPM at a forward multiple of 11.64, which rates as overvalued.Source: ShutterstockFrom the charts, it’s not surprising. Since the Jan. opener, CI gave up over 19% of its equity value. And in the trailing one-year period, CI barely pokes its head above water. Therefore, it seems like a future name among hedge fund sell-offs, particularly if mass layoffs continue. With accelerating pink-slip distributions, Cigna’s addressable market may decline. Troubles might be appearing on the financials. The company only features modest stability in the balance sheet. Further, its revenue growth and net margin print unremarkable stats.Source: ShutterstockWhile Danaher tends to be a steady performer, this year, it hasn’t been that impressive. Since the January opener, DHR slipped 4%. Over the past 365 days, the security lost nearly 9%. However, the volatility for DHR might be a case of trimming as opposed to an ominous indicator of hedge fund sell-offs. Financially, Danaher offers plenty of substance.Source: ShutterstockOn paper, ORLY stock doesn’t seem to deserve the title of stocks that hedge funds are bearish on. Since the January opener, ORLY gained more than 6% of its equity value.  In the trailing one-year period, it’s up nearly 24%. However, it’s quite possible that the top dogs don’t believe the underlying recessionary argument will hold up indefinitely.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

CRM,Supreme Court Wary of Broad Ruling in Slack Shareholder Case,"(Bloomberg) -- The US Supreme Court hinted at a narrow ruling in a case involving Salesforce Inc.’s Slack unit as the court considered restricting shareholder suits over company statements issued as part of a direct listing.Most Read from BloombergWorthless Degrees Are Creating an Unemployable Generation in IndiaFirst Republic Worked Hard to Woo Rich Clients. It Was the Bank’s UndoingApple, Goldman Sachs Debut Savings Account With 4.15% Annual YieldA $300,000 Salary Feels Like $100,000 in The Priciest US CitiesOne Tesla Deal Propels Little-Known Family to $800 Million FortuneTwo potentially pivotal justices, Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch, voiced interest in kicking part of the case back to a federal appeals court rather than issuing a definitive ruling.The case marks the Supreme Court’s first look at a direct listing since the Securities and Exchange Commission authorized the practice in 2018. In a direct listing, companies go public without selling shares through an initial public offering, instead letting early investors sell their registered and unregistered shares on a public exchange.The justices are considering a suit by Fiyyaz Pirani, who contends a 2019 Slack registration statement failed to disclose the extent to which the company would have to provide credits to customers over service disruptions. Salesforce acquired Slack in 2021.Salesforce contends Pirani lacks legal standing to sue under Sections 11 and 12 of the 1933 Securities Act because he bought unregistered shares, rather than the shares registered under the allegedly misleading statement. A federal appeals court let the suit go forward.Kavanaugh and Gorsuch both suggested they might side with Slack on Section 11 but return the case to the appeals court to revisit Section 12. Kavanaugh said he was “worried about making a mistake” given that neither the lower courts nor the SEC had extensively analyzed the Section 12 issue.Section 11 centers on misleading registration statements, while Section 12 concerns prospectuses and oral communications.Tracing SharesSlack’s registration statement covered 118 million of the 283 million shares that became eligible for sale on the market. The other 165 million shares were exempt from registration under an SEC rule.Salesforce’s lawyer, Thomas Hungar, said courts traditionally require investors to trace their shares to the registration statement.Interpreting federal securities law to the contrary “would dramatically expand the scope of liability, disrupt the capital formation process and upset settled expectations,” Hungar said.Pirani’s lawyer, Kevin Russell, said that sort of requirement would be “exceedingly burdensome not only for the parties, but also for the courts and the juries who are going to have to determine the registration status of perhaps millions of individual shares of stocks.”Chief Justice John Roberts questioned whether Russell’s argument could be squared with the language of Section 11, which allows lawsuits over registration statements by people who acquire “such security.”“That’s a big hurdle for you to get over,” he said.Justice Elena Kagan voiced similar views, telling Russell he had a “hard row to hoe here.” But Kagan said Section 12 was a different matter and might well authorize suits by holders of unregistered shares.“There’s really nothing in Section 12 that makes it like Section 11,” Kagan said.The SEC didn’t file a brief in the case, a silence that left some of the justices perplexed. Kavanaugh called the SEC’s absence “odd.”Justice Sonia Sotomayor said commentators have suggested the US solicitor general, who represents the administration at the Supreme Court, was having trouble figuring out what do to with the case.“May not be the only one,” quipped Roberts.The court is scheduled to rule by late June in the case, Slack Technologies v. Pirani, 22-200.(Updates with comments from lawyers, Roberts, Kagan starting in 9th paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekVolkswagen Left Behind as China Goes All In on EVsThere Are No Fees at America’s Smallest BankBanking Crises Are Preventable, But Human Nature Gets in the WayA Smart Gun Is Finally Here, But Does Anyone Want It?Americans Using Buy Now, Pay Later for Groceries Risk ‘Cycle of Debt’©2023 Bloomberg L.P.","April 17, 2023 at 2:55 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/supreme-court-wary-broad-ruling-180323863.html,Bloomberg,-0.21875,0.50625,-0.008296130952380952,0.39689980158730154

CRM,Wall Street Analysts Think Salesforce.com (CRM) Is a Good Investment: Is It?,"Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?Salesforce.com currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.81, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 37 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.81 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 37 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 22 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 59.5% and 5.4% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for CRMAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.ABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Is CRM Worth Investing In?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for Salesforce.com, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.1% over the past month to $7.11.Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for Salesforce.com.

CRM,Jeremy Grantham and Goldman Sachs Have One Thing in Common: They Both Like These 3 Stocks,"Market watchers are waiting for the day the Fed starts cutting rates, but those hoping such an act will signal the beginning of a bull market are in for a rude awakening. At least, that is the opinion of Jeremy Grantham.Across decades of investing, Grantham’s reputation has been built on predicating market meltdowns, and the legendary investor and GMO co-founder thinks the bear will only be halfway through its wrecking job once the Fed changes it inflation-combating strategy.“Most of the decline in these great bear markets only happens after the first interest rate cut,” Grantham recently said. “So you tell me when the first interest rate cut is, and I will tell you when the second half of the pain is going to start.”However, that doesn’t mean that Grantham has lost hope for all stocks. His portfolio still includes big bets on several names and he’s not the only one showing confidence in these equities. Banking giant Goldman Sachs has also been singing the praises of 3 Grantham-owned stocks, believing they are primed to push ahead from here. Let’s take a closer look.We’ll start with SolarEdge Technologies, the biggest supplier of photovoltaic inverters in the world. By creating a device that attaches to the back of the solar panel and increases the amount of power generated, the company essentially became the first to make power optimizers a commercially viable product, helping to reduce the cost of the energy the system creates.Given Europe is looking to become less dependent on Russian natural gas, the company is well setup up to cater to increasing demand in the region, which now accounts for nearly 60% of its total solar inverter volume.Grantham obviously thinks SolarEdge has what it takes to outfox the bear. In Q4, GMO increased its position by 59% and holds a total of 657,660 SEDG shares. These are currently worth $189.6 million.Mirroring Grantham’s confidence, Goldman Sachs analyst Brian Lee believes the future is bright for this smart energy leader. He writes: “SEDG’s gross margin recovery story is still only in the middle innings with more drivers of upside yet to fully play out (e.g. freight, Sella 2 manufacturing, IRA credits), while the specter of potential upside and leverage to any further European policy support (e.g. IRA) would make SEDG well-positioned to see further upside in numbers, in our view. At the same time, the Euro could prove to be a tailwind again in the near-term.”The next name endorsed by Grantham and Goldman is another leader in its field. Salesforce is a software colossus, specializing in customer relationship management (CRM). Its software and apps provide its client base with the means to offer their own clientele a higher level of service.The offerings focus on sales, analytics, and automation to bespoke customer service, community management, and relationship intelligence, amongst others. The company touts itself as the world’s premier CRM platform for businesses, and with a market cap over $192 billion, that’s no idle boast.That must all be very pleasing to Grantham. GMO’s stake in Salesforce stands at 1,385,522 shares, currently worth $265.3 million.For Goldman Sachs analyst Kash Rangan, when considering this tech giant’s future, there’s plenty to be upbeat about.“We reiterate the company’s impressive organic growth rate given the company’s size at +$30bn estimated revenues (GSe) in FY23,” Rangan said. “We remain bullish on the company’s ability to drive continued y/y operating margin expansion beyond FY23. We would point out that companies such as Microsoft, Adobe, Intuit and Autodesk which embarked on a journey towards improving OM all benefited from their valuation multiples getting re-rated significantly higher on an EV/Sales basis. We think CRM could join this list especially as the company grows into a formidable $50 billion business in F26/C25, benefiting from a much lower starting point for OM relative to other companies, which on the flip side also offers plenty of room for improvement.”Last but not least on our Grantham-Goldman backed list, we have Carrier Global, a company formed way back in 1915 as a specialist in the making and distribution of HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning) systems.While Carrier is most famous for its residential and commercial air conditioners, its remit has expanded since its early days and now includes the manufacturing of commercial refrigeration and food service equipment, while the company is also an expert in fire and security technologies.For the most part, over the past couple of years, Carrier has managed to beat bottom-line expectations, and while it did not manage to do so in the most recent quarterly update, for 4Q22, at $0.40, adj. EPS still met the analysts’ forecast. Likewise at the top-line; the company might have seen revenue drop by 1% year-over-year to $5.1 billion, but that figure edged ahead of the consensus estimate by $30 million. Looking ahead to the full year 2023, the company guided for sales of $22 billion, also improving on Wall Street’s $20.39 billion forecast, while adj. EPS is expected in the range between $2.50 and $2.60 – at the mid-point, the same as consensus at $2.55.Jeremy Grantham is clearly upbeat about Carrier. His GMO fund currently owns 1,138,546 shares worth $49.55 million.When assessing Carrier’s prospects, Goldman Sachs analyst Joe Ritchie thinks the company is playing it safe with regards to its outlook. He writes, “Improving price/cost, ongoing cost savings, and continued strength in Commercial HVAC suggest EPS guide is likely conservative, and we remain bullish on the company in the long-term given the self-help opportunity coupled with strong growth tailwinds from education stimulus, healthy building orders, and heat pump demand.”Disclaimer: The opinions expressed in this article are solely those of the featured analyst.

CRM,Salesforce.com (CRM) Stock Moves -1.36%: What You Should Know,"Salesforce.com (CRM) closed the most recent trading day at $188.89, moving -1.36% from the previous trading session. Elsewhere, the Dow gained 0.29%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 1.92%.Heading into today, shares of the customer-management software developer had gained 9.1% over the past month, lagging the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 10.29% and outpacing the S&P 500's gain of 6.51% in that time.Salesforce.com will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release. In that report, analysts expect Salesforce.com to post earnings of $1.61 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 64.29%.

CRM,Salesforce Inc. (CRM) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,"Shares of this customer-management software developer have returned +9.1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +6.5% change. The Zacks Computer - Software industry, to which Salesforce.com belongs, has gained 14.3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Salesforce.com is expected to post earnings of $1.61 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +64.3%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.1%.The consensus earnings estimate of $7.11 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +35.7%. This estimate has changed +0.1% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.80 indicates a change of +23.7% from what Salesforce.com is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.5%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for Salesforce.com.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Salesforce.com, the consensus sales estimate of $8.17 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +10.2%. The $34.62 billion and $38.48 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +10.4% and +11.1%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistorySalesforce.com reported revenues of $8.38 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +14.4%. EPS of $1.68 for the same period compares with $0.84 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.99 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +4.99%. The EPS surprise was +24.44%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Salesforce.com is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Salesforce.com. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Salesforce Inc.

CRM,The 7 Best Growth Stocks to Buy in the Cloud Computing Sector,"Cloud computing has revolutionized how organizations operate, enhancing efficiency levels for digital operations. Companies worldwide are harnessing the power of cloud computing to analyze data, develop cutting-edge machine-learning models, and facilitate seamless collaboration among teams.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.comOver the years, it’s consistently generated double-digit revenue growth from its cloud division, essentially becoming a cash cow for its business. Recent results have shown a marked slowdown in growth rates from the division on the back of the challenging macro conditions. Nevertheless, it still posted a 20% increase on a year-over-year basis in sales, contributing $21.4 billion to its overall revenue base.Over the long term, research firms such as Redburn believe the division could be a stand-alone entity with a valuation of over $3 trillion. Moreover, with Amazon trading at a market cap of roughly $1.04 trillion, it could represent a colossal 200% bump in value for just its cloud division.Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comFurthermore, CRM has recently demonstrated a shift towards prioritizing shareholder returns. On the back of its strong cash flow performance, it has bumped its stock buyback plan from $10 billion to $20 billion.

CRM,3 Super Speculative Tech Stocks That Could Make You Very Rich,"As a result, the time is ripe to look at speculative tech stocks again in the hopes of picking a winner.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOver the past ten years, brief underperformance in the technology sector has consistently presented lucrative buying opportunities in the long run. Currently, tech stocks have again shifted towards outperformance, as observed in 2023.So, with the right research, investors stand to make a lot of money from investing in the best speculative tech stocks out there. Keeping this in mind, here are three speculative tech stocks to buy that are worth considering:Source: Muh.Imron / Shutterstock.comSea, a conglomerate headquartered in Singapore, operates three key businesses: digital entertainment, e-commerce (which includes digital payments), and financial services. The primary reason for Sea’s appeal as a tech stock investment lies in its potential for market expansion opportunities.The focus of the tech conglomerate is Southeast Asia. The company’s three key business lines are doing exceptionally well in the region. Shopee is the largest e-commerce platform in Southeast Asia, SeaMoney is considered Sea’s payments arm, and Garena distributes game titles across Southeast Asian countries and Taiwan.At the same time, it is also delivering on key metrics. Sea reported revenue of $3.45 billion in the quarter that ended December 2022, up 7% year on year, and a net income of $426.8 million, up 169% year on year. The company’s operating income saw a significant boost of 218% to $520.53 million. It was the fourth quarter in a row that the e-commerce company outperformed analyst estimates.All things considered, the growth story is far from over for this one. That makes Sea one of the best speculative tech stocks out there.Source: Tada Images / Shutterstock.comWhile this move comes as the company starts to reduce its recruitment drive initiated during the early stages of the pandemic, it is not the sole reason to invest in the company.A more comprehensive understanding of the organization’s strategy, performance, and long-term prospects should be considered when making investment decisions. Despite the layoffs, there are plenty of fundamental reasons why Salesforce is moving in the right direction.Salesforce is taking steps in the right direction by decreasing costs and positioning itself for future growth. Its strategic plans, including downsizing its office space footprint and implementing more hybrid work policies, show its commitment to increasing efficiency and agility while remaining competitive in the software industry.However, it’s important to note that Salesforce’s high valuation compared to its peers may deter value investors. The current price-to-earnings ratio of 916.9 times is significantly higher than the industry median of 27.20, making it a potentially risky investment. If market sentiment towards the company changes, it could lead to pullbacks in the stock price.Source: Tattoboo / ShutterstockThey are concerned that Adobe’s dominance in the creativity software would gain an unfair advantage. Figma’s breakneck growth suggests it could become a much larger piece of Adobe’s pie and significantly boost its long-term revenue growth, even though it accounts for only about 2% of Adobe’s fiscal 2022 revenue.Despite regulatory concerns about its proposed acquisition of Figma, Adobe’s Digital Media segment, which includes its Creative Cloud services, continues to perform well.Overall, Adobe is in a good position whether the mega-deal goes through or not. If you are researching speculative tech stocks, ADBE is a reasonable pick. The fact that the stock is down over 15% over the last 12 months only adds to its appeal.Faizan Farooque is a contributing author for InvestorPlace.com and numerous other financial sites.

CRM,Why speculative AI stocks like C3.ai and BigBear.ai are seeing monster volatility,"There are three things investors could have banked on over the last five trading sessions: The stock market would open at 9:30 a.m., the stock market would close at 4 p.m., and speculative AI stocks would see monster levels of volatility.And who said there was nothing definite in investing?!So what gives with the head-turning action in the aforementioned speculative AI names (which are underpinned by companies that have no profits)?Traders point to a few factors.Point taken.""Basically I think there’s some regulation concerns, not so much in the governmental sense yet, but perhaps industry regulations. That’s just injecting some fundamental uncertainty into the whole space, and given the valuations and popularity of the AI names, it’s resulting in some wild gyrations!"" Essaye says.The past week alone has put a spotlight on Essaye's view.“Tech companies have a responsibility, in my view, to make sure their products are safe before making them public,” President Joe Biden said at a science and tech conference on Wednesday.While the development of next-generation AI is in full swing and the broad swath of sector plays likely to remain of interest to investors, Miller Tabak's Maley reminds everyone that speculative names are just that — speculative, and littered with risk.So proceed with caution into names like C3.ai, SoundHound, and BigBear.ai.The rally ""could certainly have legs, but at some point, valuations matter.

CRM,"If You Invested $1000 in Salesforce.com a Decade Ago, This is How Much It'd Be Worth Now","How much a stock's price changes over time is important for most investors, since price performance can both impact your investment portfolio and help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.Another factor that can influence investors is FOMO, or the fear of missing out, especially with tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.What if you'd invested in Salesforce.com (CRM) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to CRM for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?Salesforce.com's Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at Salesforce.com's main business drivers.Headquartered in San Francisco, Salesforce, Inc., founded in 1999, is the leading provider of on-demand Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software, which enables organizations to better manage critical operations, such as sales force automation, customer service and support, marketing automation, document management, analytics and custom application development.Salesforce is currently the largest CRM vendor in the world with a market share of nearly 20% according to reports of Gartner, a global research and advisory firm. Its nearest rival, SAP is way behind at a market share of around 8%.  About 90% of the Fortune 100 companies uses at least one Salesforce software.The company has leveraged its expertise in on-demand software to increase the scale of operations. It also offers a technology platform for customers and developers to build and run business applications.Salesforce helps companies of every size and industry to connect with their customers in new ways through existing and emerging technologies including cloud, mobile, social, IoT and artificial intelligence (AI).Rapid digital transformation and the company’s sustained focus on introducing more aligned products as per customer needs is driving its revenues higher. Over the last eight years, Salesforce’s annual revenues have sextuple from $5.4 billion in fiscal 2015 to $31.4 billion in fiscal 2023.There are two main revenue streams — Subscription and Support and Professional Services & Other.Subscription revenues comprise subscription fees from customers, accessing the company’s enterprise cloud computing services (Cloud Services), software licenses and subscription fees recognized from customers for additional support beyond the standard support lent by the company. This segment accounted for more than 93% of Salesforce’s fiscal 2023 revenues.Professional Services & Other revenues consist of fees that the company derives from consulting and implementation services and training. This segment accounted for the remaining 7% of Salesforce’s fiscal 2023 revenues.Bottom LineAnyone can invest, but building a successful investment portfolio requires research, patience, and a little bit of risk. So, if you had invested in Salesforce.com ten years ago, you're likely feeling pretty good about your investment today.A $1000 investment made in April 2013 would be worth $4,468.55, or a 346.86% gain, as of April 3, 2023, according to our calculations. Investors should note that this return excludes dividends but includes price increases.In comparison, the S&P 500 gained 161.87% and the price of gold went up 21.56% over the same time frame.Analysts are anticipating more upside for CRM.Salesforce is benefiting from a robust demand environment as customers are undergoing a major digital transformation. The rapid adoption of its cloud-based solutions is driving demand for its products. Its sustained focus on introducing more aligned products as per customer needs is driving its top-line. Continued deal wins in the international market is another growth driver. The acquisition of Slack would position the company to be a leader in enterprise team collaboration solution space and better compete with Microsoft’s Teams product. We expect CRM revenues to grow at a CAGR of 11.2% through fiscal 2024-2026. However, stiff competition and unfavorable currency fluctuations are concerns. Besides, challenging macroeconomic environment might hurt its growth prospects In the near-term.The stock has jumped 7.16% over the past four weeks. Additionally, no earnings estimate has gone lower in the past two months, compared to 19 higher, for fiscal 2023; the consensus estimate has moved up as well.Salesforce Inc.

CRM,"HubSpot - Great Service, Bad Price","HubSpot (NYSE:HUBS) is a leading software company that offers a suite of products for inbound marketing, sales and customer service. Founded in 2006 by Brian Halligan and Dharmesh Shah, the company's primary product is the HubSpot Growth Platform, an all-in-one solution that combines these distinct channels and more. The company uses ""freemium"" tactics to drive customer growth, which was 24% year over year in 2022. HubSpot now has over 167,000 customers, with 8,400 customers added in the fourth quarter.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with HUBS. Click here to check it out. HUBS 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of HUBSPeter Lynch Chart of HUBSBusiness model breakdownHubSpot's product offerings can be broken down as follows:Marketing Hub: This includes tools for content management, search engine optimization (SEO), email marketing, social media marketing, analytics and more. It helps businesses create and promote engaging content to attract leads and convert them into customers.Sales Hub: This offers tools for managing contacts, tracking deals, automating sales processes and forecasting revenue. It helps sales teams close deals faster and more efficiently.Service Hub: This provides tools for managing customer support, tracking and resolving issues and building customer loyalty. It helps businesses provide exceptional customer service, turning satisfied customers into advocates for the brand.CMS Hub: This is a content management system that allows businesses to create and manage their websites easily. It offers a range of customizable templates, responsive design and built-in SEO tools.Operations Hub: This tool helps businesses synchronize, clean and maintain their data across different systems, ensuring that all teams are working with accurate and up-to-date information.It operates a Cloud software business model, which is among the best business models for profitability. It is generally able to automate much of the customer touchpoints and onboarding to scale. Costs are relatively fixed and the margins are incredible.Many companies choose to sacrifice short-term profits by maximizing sales and marketing spend. It's a luxury that subscription models can afford better than other models, considering the premium investors are willing to pay for revenue growth and the promise of future profits.The crucial aspect of HubSpot's strategy is targeting the small- and medium-sized business (SMB) segment, where it can customize offerings to cater to businesses of specific sizes. By providing free tiers and scalable pricing options based on feature requirements, HubSpot ensures a smooth onboarding experience and a comprehensive suite of tools that serve as a nearly all-in-one solution.HubSpot has become the go-to option for many SMBs, which have often been overlooked by cloud software providers. The company's ability to consistently develop and deliver high-quality additional features enables a land-and-expand approach, which serves as a key competitive advantage for HubSpot. 98% of HubSpot's revenue comes from subscription services, which are very sticky. Companies are pushing more on soft marketing and utilizing social media to attract customers, rather than relying on direct sales. As a result, HubSpot's share of the overall CRM market could continue to expand.FinancialsFor a company that has been around since 2006, it should be profitable at this point. Yet, despite enjoying gross margins of 82%, HubSpot has decided to spend a large chunk of its profits on research and development. In 2013, the company had $15 million in R&D expenses on $50 million in gross profit. Not much seems to have actually changed in the product since then, but the R&D expense has risen to $422 million. This expense puts the company considerably in the red, taking up nearly 30% of its operating expenses. By comparison, industry leader Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) only spends 21% on R&D.Some metrics are not so great for a technology company. HubSpot, like many of these SaaS operations, needs a lot of people to function properly. It has over 7,000 employees and generates around $235,000 in revenue per employee. In comparison, Salesforce gets over $390,000 in sales per employee.The company also needs to address the issues surrounding stock-based compensation dragging down profitability as well. I think it spends way too much to compensate its top executives considering the company's continued lack of profitability.That being said, 2023 is all about artificial intelligence, and OpenAI's GPT platform may allow HubSpot to drive more revenue per employee. I hope the company decides to tap into AI as a source of growth, as I believe this could help a lot. Only time will tell whether or not the company can utilize it well.ValuationHistorically, it has been a bad idea to bet against the technology industry as a whole. However, that alone does not make HubSpot worth owning, as the tech industry has more duds than winners.HubSpot is currently experiencing a rather dramatic slowdown. The company anticipates $2.05 billion to $2.06 billion in revenue for 2023, which equates to nearly 19% year over year growth. This comes after 33% growth during 2022 and 47% revenue growth in 2021. At this rate, it would take another 16 years to reach the level Salesforce is at today.Of course, the stock's current multiples are based on an incredible growth rate achieved in the last five years, which is slowing considerably. Thus, I think it is likely only a matter of time before the market re-adjusts HubSpot's value lower.","March 31, 2023 at 10:21 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hubspot-great-bad-price-162118760.html,GuruFocus.com,0.0500000000000001,0.7083333333333333,0.17020055770055767,0.4358966108966108
CRM,Why You Should Avoid Overvalued and Overhyped CRM Stock (For Now),"Yet, any stock can be vulnerable to pullbacks, especially after a huge run-up. Before investing in Salesforce, consider the risk-versus-reward profile, as a substantially smaller company might not be able to live up to its own high expectations.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsCRM stock jumped from $165 to nearly $190 after the earnings and guidance release. Now, Salesforce has the daunting task of justifying the hype and meeting its own revenue expectations. That’s going to be challenging during a time when some businesses are cutting costs due to elevated inflation and recession fears.Alarmingly, Salesforce’s workforce increased 62% during that hype-fueled time. Now, in 2023, the company is laying off 10% of its staff. It certainly won’t be easy for a significantly smaller Salesforce to live up to its pumped-up revenue expectations.Another concern is the valuation of CRM stock. The aforementioned post-earnings share-price rally made the stock even more expensive than it already was.Meanwhile, Salesforce’s TTM price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 6.01x is more than double the sector median P/S ratio of 2.68x. In addition, Salesforce’s TTM price-to-cash-flow (P/CF) ratio is 26.73x, versus the sector median P/CF ratio of 19.79x.Given the company’s sky-high P/E ratio, it’s sensible to wait for the Salesforce share price to move closer to its 52-week low of $126.34 before taking a position. Otherwise, you might end up on the wrong side of the trade.Besides, Salesforce has to knock it out of the park with stellar revenue stats over the coming year. This will be difficult to achieve with a reduced staff. So, now isn’t the right time to buy CRM stock, as lower prices are likely on the horizon.David Moadel has provided compelling content – and crossed the occasional line – on behalf of Motley Fool, Crush the Street, Market Realist, TalkMarkets, TipRanks, Benzinga, and (of course) InvestorPlace.com.

CRM,Why Is Salesforce.com (CRM) Up 5.4% Since Last Earnings Report?,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Salesforce.com (CRM). Shares have added about 5.4% in that time frame, outperforming the S&P 500.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Salesforce.com due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Salesforce reported better-than-expected financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. The company’s fourth-quarter non-GAAP earnings doubled to $1.68 per share from the 84 cents reported in the year-ago quarter. The figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.36.The quarterly non-GAAP earnings included a loss of 25 cents per share from the mark-to-mark accounting of CRM’s strategic investments at a non-GAAP tax rate of 22%. However, the company’s ongoing restructuring initiative, which includes trimming the workforce, benefited fourth-quarter non-GAAP earnings by 9 cents per share.Salesforce’s quarterly revenues of $8.38 billion climbed 14% year over year, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.99 billion. The top line also improved 17% in constant currency (cc).The company has been benefiting from the robust demand environment as customers are undergoing a major digital transformation. Thus, the rapid adoption of its cloud-based solutions resulted in the better-than-anticipated performance in the fiscal fourth quarter.Coming to CRM’s business segments, revenues from Subscription and Support (93% of the total revenues) increased 14.1% from the year-earlier period to $7.79 billion. Professional Services and Other (7% of total sales) revenues climbed 19.5% to $595 million.Under the Subscription and Support segment, Sales Cloud revenues grew 13% year over year to $1.8 billion. Revenues from Service Cloud, one of the company’s largest and fastest-growing businesses, also improved 13% to $1.9 billion.Marketing & Commerce Cloud revenues jumped 13% to $1.2 billion. Salesforce Platform and Other revenues were up 15% to $1.6 billion. Also, revenues from Data increased 18% year over year to $1.3 billion.Geographically, Salesforce registered revenue growth of 14% in America (67.5% of the total revenues), 30% in the Asia Pacific (9.4%) and 20% in the EMEA (23.1%) on a year-over-year basis.Salesforce’s gross profit came in at $6.28 billion, up 18.3% from the prior-year period. Moreover, the gross margin improved 200 basis points (bps) to 75%.Salesforce recorded a non-GAAP operating income of $2.45 billion, up 123.3% from the year-ago quarter’s level of $1.1 billion. Moreover, the non-GAAP operating margin expanded 1,420 bps to 29.2% from 15% in the year-ago quarter due to lower operating expenses as a percentage of total sales. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenues declined to 71% from 75% in the year-ago quarter.Salesforce exited the fiscal fourth quarter with cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $12.5 billion, up from the $11.9 billion recorded at the end of the previous quarter.CRM generated operating cash flow of $2.79 billion and free cash flow of $2.57 billion in the fourth quarter.

With the total fiscal 2023 buyback of $4 billion, the company has now $16 billion remaining under its current authorization limit.Salesforce provided strong guidance for the first quarter and fiscal 2024. For the fiscal first quarter, Salesforce projects total sales between $8.16 billion and $8.18 billion (midpoint $8.17 billion).The revenue guidance includes a $150-million negative impact of unfavorable currency exchange rates. Furthermore, CRM anticipates non-GAAP earnings per share in the band of $1.60-$1.61 for the current quarter.For fiscal 2024, Salesforce forecasts revenues in the range of $34.5-$34.7 billion.

CRM,Salesforce Inc. (CRM) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,"Over the past month, shares of this customer-management software developer have returned +5.4%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +2.3% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Software industry, which Salesforce.com falls in, has gained 12.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Salesforce.com is expected to post earnings of $1.61 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +64.3%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +61.5%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.11 points to a change of +35.7% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +55.6%.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.80 indicates a change of +23.7% from what Salesforce.com is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +26.1%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Salesforce.com is rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Salesforce.com, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $8.17 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +10.2%. For the current and next fiscal years, $34.62 billion and $38.48 billion estimates indicate +10.4% and +11.1% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistorySalesforce.com reported revenues of $8.38 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +14.4%. EPS of $1.68 for the same period compares with $0.84 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.99 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +4.99%. The EPS surprise was +24.44%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Salesforce.com is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Salesforce.com. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Salesforce Inc.

CRM,"Marc Benioff says he can juggle empathy, cost cuts, and layoffs as he doubles down on efficiency at Salesforce","“I’m willing to take the bullets and the cuts and the vilification,” Benioff, 58, tells me during a wide-ranging interview that took place via phone while he was on a flight to the East Coast. “That’s what you have to do as CEO, especially through difficult times.”“It’s much harder when things are contracting than when things are expanding,” Benioff says of bringing people into his view of the world and business’s role in it.Indeed, Benioff now finds himself having to listen to—and prove that he can answer—stakeholders with all sorts of new demands. His ability to navigate these loud voices, from employees asking for more flexible work-at-home policies to shareholders agitating for leaner operations, will prove to be a useful case study not just in Benioff’s style of “empathetic” leadership. In many ways, it could also serve as a referendum on the whole model of stakeholder capitalism.“It [layoffs] is something that you never want to have to do, but everybody knows you have to do it, because it’s just the nature of business,” says Benioff, and then quickly adds: “But that doesn’t mean that you can’t have a great company, and that you can’t be a great place to work.”Benioff is trying to tell me that these are challenging times for business leaders—a common CEO mantra in today’s climate. At least, that’s what I think he’s trying to tell me. As is typical in conversations with the always-loquacious Benioff, the conversation soon takes a sharp turn to the philosophical.To be sure, the recent layoffs at Salesforce weren’t the first in its history. In 2000, when the dotcom bubble burst, Benioff laid off 20% of his workforce (and Salesforce has had small “adjustments” since). But that was before the company was public, back when it employed only 100 workers. It was also around the time that Benioff launched the company’s 1-1-1 model, which dedicates 1% of the company’s equity, 1% of its product, and 1% of employees’ time to philanthropic causes. The CEO has long championed business as the “greatest platform for change.” But he really solidified his role as one of the lead evangelists of the stakeholder capitalist movement during the pandemic.“In the pandemic, it was CEOs in many, many cases all over the world who were the heroes,” Benioff told a remote audience during the 2021 World Economic Forum gathering, which took place online instead of in the snowy mountain town of Davos, Switzerland. “They’re the ones who stepped forward with their financial resources, their corporate resources, their employees, their factories, and pivoted rapidly—not for profit, but to save the world.”Benioff, along with a team of other big-name execs, helped procure 50 million units of personal protective equipment like gowns and masks early on in the pandemic, shipping it from China to hospitals in the United States via chartered airplanes and trucks. As the pandemic was unfolding, demand exploded for software that helps businesses run their operations online, like Salesforce’s customer relationship management tools. Salesforce had already been hiring at a fast clip, and during the pandemic Salesforce onboarded another 20,000 employees in a one-year span—and of course many more through acquisitions like Slack.Other companies, like Amazon, have been decidedly more blunt. To wit, CEO Andy Jassy’s March 20 memo announcing a second round of layoffs: “I’m writing to share that we intend to eliminate about 9,000 more positions in the next few weeks … This was a difficult decision, but one that we think is best for the company long term.”While Benioff likes to say this is his third recession, many of his younger, newer hires haven’t yet lived through even one downturn during their careers. And even those who were not laid off have had to make uncomfortable changes. Early on in the pandemic, Salesforce embraced remote work, telling employees they could work from anywhere. When the company acquired collaboration tool Slack for $27.7 billion in July 2021, Benioff said integrating the product would help customers “make the digital transformation.” But that transition to remote work wasn’t as smooth as expected.Benioff made waves when he took to Slack, not long before announcing layoffs, to ask why employees hired during the pandemic showed “much lower productivity.” To the CEO, this was an effort to solicit feedback. But to some employees, Benioff’s musings felt like a betrayal, a stark contrast to the pandemic-era benefit of getting one Friday off per month, which had just recently ended.The reaction inside Salesforce was harsh, with some employees accusing Benioff of being tone deaf in Slack channels. Other recent cost-saving measures, such as lower annual “gratitude” bonuses and the decision to abandon Slack’s snazzy San Francisco headquarters, have also generated employee blowback. In late March, Salesforce also shuttered Future Forum, Slack’s ambitious think tank that was focused on research around remote work.Asked whether tech employees have gained too much power in recent years, Benioff says no, and points to Slack as an effective—if lively—way to communicate directly with employees on a variety of issues. But even that direct access has its limits. “It’s hard for them [employees] because they don’t understand why you’re taking certain actions or how it’s going to affect them,” says Benioff. “It’s understandable because we’ve had an up market for more than a decade.”In recent months, Salesforce has summoned certain employees back to the office. Some percentage of the company’s workforce will always be remote, as was the case pre-pandemic. But those who don’t have that designation are now being asked to come into the office at least a few times a month depending on their roles and teams, says Benioff, noting that tracking productivity is easier for certain functions, like sales and, to a lesser degree, engineering.“We hired a lot of people, and those folks don’t have the benefit of knowing others and having the office experience,” Benioff says of his evolving views on remote work. “Bringing them back into the office is becoming more important than I think anyone realized.”But again, justifying a return to office, however flexible, however backed by data, is hard to do when you’ve just spent the past three years telling employees they could work from anywhere. Just like announcing layoffs after you’ve hired hordes of new employees and told them they were like friends and family.In recent months, Benioff has gotten caught in the crosshairs of some conservative politicians who have jumped onto the anti-ESG bandwagon. Vivek Ramaswamy, 2024 Republican presidential hopeful and former executive chairman of Strive Asset Management, which owns a small stake in Salesforce, has criticized the CEO for choosing politics over profits. And with some blaming Silicon Valley Bank’s collapse on a supposed “distraction” by diversity efforts, it’s easy to see how some of Salesforce’s speed bumps could be smeared with similar allegations.But Benioff says his devotion to using business as a platform for societal change is intact.“There’s been a politicization of stakeholder capitalism which is in many cases unfair,” says Benioff. “What employees want is to be treated well, and to make sure that their companies are doing the right thing, which is at the heart of stakeholder capitalism.”Benioff has a point: Many of the times he’s taken a stand, like when he threatened to pull business out of Indiana because of an anti-LGBTQ law, came from listening to what his employees were telling him, not the other way around. At least as of now, Salesforce’s biggest activist shareholders—the ones who have actually acquired sizable stakes—are not speaking out about the company’s diversity programs, nor the fact that Benioff has made it his life mission to plant 1 trillion trees by 2030. They’re much more concerned with boosting software sales and profits. And in a succession plan.Bret Taylor wasn’t the first co-CEO to leave Salesforce, but his departure was a surprise. So were the subsequent exits of Stewart Butterfield, the former head of Slack, and of Mark Nelson, the ex-CEO of Tableau, another pricey Salesforce acquisition. “Each person has to make their own decisions,” says Benioff.8,000layoffs implemented by Salesforce since January 2023Asked whether he would pursue the co-CEO model again, Benioff says probably not anytime soon. “Right now, profitability is my only strategy,” he says, adding that he does have a current succession plan in place. (Who is the new heir apparent? Unsurprisingly, Benioff won’t say.)Whatever the plan is, Benioff is clearly under pressure to solidify it. Activist investors clamoring for change have already pushed Salesforce to appoint three new directors to its board. And unlike some other founder-CEOs, Benioff isn’t shareholder-proof. The board, if not satisfied, could vote him out.At least some signs seem to be pointing in the right direction for Benioff: On March 27, Salesforce and one of its loudest activist shareholders, Elliott Investment Management, issued a joint statement, with Elliott saying it was pleased with the company’s newfound commitment to “profitable growth,” and that it wouldn’t move forward with nominating its own slate of director nominations, which it had threatened to do.“I actually think it’s very healthy,” Benioff says of the role activist investors have played in his company’s decisions in recent months. “You’re going to meet people you’ve never met, and they’re going to have perspectives that are completely different. Their primary focus is to make money, and that’s what they’re doing.”For now, Benioff doesn’t see the goal of making money—and getting Salesforce on a more profitable track—as mutually exclusive with planting trees or investing in DEI initiatives or calling his workforce his family. “My performance speaks for itself, and that’s all I can hope for,” he tells me after his plane lands. That’s true. But now comes the hard part: getting his stakeholders—all of them—to agree, even in hard economic times. In other words, to explain the unexplainable.Additional reporting by Kylie Robison5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeExpert advice to keep your money safe during bank failuresUFB Direct savings account is offering an APY above 5%—and with no feesThis is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 home ","March 30, 2023 at 9:30 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/m-willing-bullets-marc-benioff-153000800.html,Fortune,-0.15555555555555559,0.2888888888888889,0.10733301323090057,0.4424053157327804
CRM,Salesforce.com (CRM) Is Considered a Good Investment by Brokers: Is That True?,"The recommendations of Wall Street analysts are often relied on by investors when deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock. Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?Salesforce.com currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.81, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 37 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.81 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 37 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 22 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 59.5% and 5.4% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for CRMAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.Zacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.ABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Should You Invest in CRM?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for Salesforce.com, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 56% over the past month to $7.11.Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for Salesforce.com.

CRM,Salesforce Averts Elliott Proxy Fight After Share Gains,"(Bloomberg) -- Salesforce Inc. averted a potential proxy fight with activist investor Elliott Investment Management after its stock rose and the enterprise software company made a series of strategic changes.Most Read from Bloomberg$52 Billion Chipmaking Plan Is Racing Toward FailureNew Yorkers Are Moving to These Three Florida Cities$335,000 Pay for ‘AI Whisperer’ Jobs Appears in Red-Hot MarketFBI Releases Files on Ivana TrumpScotiabank Economist Excoriates Trudeau, Freeland Over $32 Billion Spending BoostElliott won’t proceed with its planned director nominations following Salesforce’s “strong” 2023 fiscal year report, transformation initiatives and “clear focus on value reaction,” the companies said in a joint statement on Monday.Salesforce Chief Executive Officer Marc Benioff has been grappling with a growing number of activist hedge funds agitating for higher profits. Revenue growth has slowed after a half-decade of steady hiring and large acquisitions, and the San Francisco-based company has been buffeted by executive changes including resignations of heir-apparent Bret Taylor and Slack co-founder Stewart Butterfield.Still, investors rejoiced earlier this month after the company trounced profit forecast estimates, doubled stock buyback plans and signaled it was putting its large acquisition strategy on ice. Shares have rallied 43% this year, among the largest jumps of companies in the S&P 500. They were little changed in New York at $190.29.Read More: Salesforce Finds Profit Is New Magic Word for Activist InvestorsMonday’s announcement without public concessions to the activist, like a board seat, is a win for Salesforce against Elliott, which took a multibillion-dollar stake in the software maker in January. The activist firm had put forward a slate of board directors in the open nomination window for the annual shareholder meeting, which usually is scheduled around June, suggesting the possibility of a proxy fight. In other companies, Elliott has pushed for CEOs to step down.Elliott released a positive statement after Salesforce’s blockbuster earnings, though said more work remains. The investor had earlier suggested some of the changes that Salesforce eventually made, though others, including further board director changes and succession planning, weren’t accepted at the time of earnings earlier this month.Salesforce and Elliott “have committed to continue the productive working relationship they have developed together,” the two companies said in the statement Monday. The “handshake” agreement to withdraw nominees doesn’t stop Elliott from re-engaging publicly with the company in the future, according to a person familiar with the matter who declined to be named discussing a private matter.“We feel pretty good about what we’ve been able to deliver so far,” Chief Operating Officer Brian Millham said Friday in an interview about Salesforce’s new focus on profit, before adding “it’s not a job that’s done by any stretch.” He said the firm could see job cuts beyond the 8,000 already announced, and hasn’t yet received final recommendations from consultant Bain & Co., with whom Salesforce is working to review the business.Beyond Elliott, Starboard Value, ValueAct, Jeff Ubben’s Inclusive Capital, and Dan Loeb’s Third Point have invested in Salesforce.

CRM,"Salesforce Considers More Job Cuts Amid Profit Push, COO Says","(Bloomberg) -- Salesforce Inc. could see another round of job cuts while the company continues to focus on improving profitability, said Chief Operating Officer Brian Millham.Most Read from Bloomberg$52 Billion Chipmaking Plan Is Racing Toward FailureNew Yorkers Are Moving to These Three Florida CitiesFBI Releases Files on Ivana Trump$335,000 Pay for ‘AI Whisperer’ Jobs Appears in Red-Hot MarketUBS Veteran Ermotti Returns to Lead Credit Suisse Takeover“The structure of the organization — if we feel like it needs to change and reshape — we’re going to make those moves to drive the efficiencies,” Millham said Friday in an interview. He added that consultant Bain & Co., which Salesforce is working with to review the business, has yet to provide final recommendations.After years of hiring and big acquisitions, the software company is newly focused on profitability. Salesforce in January announced it would eliminate 10% of its workforce, or about 8,000 employees, its largest-ever headcount reduction, and close offices across the US. A group of activist investors who have taken stakes in the company are pushing to cut costs further in search of increased earnings and improved profit margins.Salesforce wouldn’t be alone in the industry if it wiped out more jobs. Meta Platforms Inc., Amazon Inc. and Twilio Inc. announced additional rounds of major cuts in recent weeks, amounting to more 21,000 workers.Millham, who joined the company as its 13th employee in 1999 and was promoted to chief operating officer last year, said he’s focused on making the sales and go-to-market divisions he oversees more efficient, and finding new selling opportunities, such as with the company’s recently announced AI products. He has taken over some of the operational and customer-facing responsibilities previously held by co-Chief Executive Officer Bret Taylor before that executive left the company earlier this year, including appearances on earnings calls.The San Francisco-based company, the top maker of customer relations management software, has been looking at measures including reducing the number of salespeople assigned to each deal, utilizing third-party sellers and emphasizing productivity such as monthly sales targets, Millham said. Salesforce also is urging employees to go into the office more often, although it hasn’t imposed a return-to-office mandate. Attendance at company sites is up significantly in recent months, he said.“From the very beginning this was a performance-oriented culture,” Millham said. “We may have drifted a bit from that during the pandemic as we took care of our employees and made sure everyone was staying healthy.” He added that he wants Salesforce to have both a performance and wellness culture.The stock has jumped 43% this year, closing at $190.06 Friday in New York, making up almost all of its value after a 48% plunge in 2022.Investors rejoiced earlier this month when the company said it would reach margin targets years earlier than anticipated. “We feel pretty good about what we’ve been able to deliver so far,” Millham said, before adding “it’s not a job that’s done by any stretch.”Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekThe Texas Preacher’s $24 Million Ponzi SchemeSVB’s Collapse Shows the World’s Favorite Safe Asset Isn’t Risk-FreeCollege Students Are About to Put a Robot on the Moon Before NASAChina Lent Heavily to Developing Nations.

CRM,"Is Salesforce.com (CRM) a Solid Growth Stock? 3 Reasons to Think ""Yes""","Investors seek growth stocks to capitalize on above-average growth in financials that help these securities grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task.By their very nature, these stocks carry above-average risk and volatility. Moreover, if a company's growth story is over or nearing its end, betting on it could lead to significant loss.However, the task of finding cutting-edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.Our proprietary system currently recommends Salesforce.com (CRM) as one such stock. This company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this customer-management software developer is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:Earnings GrowthArguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.While the historical EPS growth rate for Salesforce.com is 23.3%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 35.7% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 11.3%.Cash Flow GrowthWhile cash is the lifeblood of any business, higher-than-average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds.Right now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Salesforce.com is 12.1%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of 5.9%.While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 36% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 12.9%.Promising Earnings Estimate RevisionsSuperiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.The current-year earnings estimates for Salesforce.com have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 54.2% over the past month.Bottom LineSalesforce.com has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #1 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This combination positions Salesforce.com well for outperformance, so growth investors may want to bet on it.Salesforce Inc.

CRM,Salesforce: Risks Looming on the Horizon,"Salesforce Inc. (NYSE:CRM), the leading customer relationship management software solutions provider in the world, reported strong earnings for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 on March 1, attracting wide praise from Wall Street analysts, economists and investors. Shares popped more than 15% the following day with investors getting behind the company in hopes for much higher investment returns in the future with the company pledging to focus more on profitability and operating margins.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Signs with CRM. Click here to check it out. CRM 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of CRMPeter Lynch Chart of CRMThe company doubled its share buyback program from $10 billion to $20 billion as well - a move that improved the investor sentiment toward in an era where investors have lost faith in many tech companies.Although the outlook for Salesforce seems promising, a deeper dive into the company reveals several major risks looming on the horizon.Balancing margins and growth in a competitive marketSalesforce delivered a remarkable performance in its fiscal fourth quarter, which has been touted by many analysts as a pivotal moment in the company's growth story. The company exceeded Wall Street expectations by a considerable margin, reporting strong revenue and profitability that reflects the strength of its business model amid challenging macroeconomic conditions.The company reported $31.4 billion in revenue for full fiscal 2023, representing an 18% year-over-year increase or 22% in constant currency, indicating strong underlying growth trends.Salesforce had strong operating cash flow of $7.1 billion, the highest in the company's history, which is a testament to its operational efficiency and ability to generate cash from its core business operations. This significant increase of 19% reflects the company's focus on driving growth while also maintaining a strong financial position.The company's impressive performance is a result of its relentless focus on innovation and strategic investments in its platform and product offerings. Salesforce's cloud-based software solutions enable businesses to better manage their customer relationships and drive growth by improving customer engagement and satisfaction. However, despite its strong performance and market leadership position, the company is facing a few risks and challenges.One major issue is the presence of powerful activist investors who are seeking to exert control over the company. Elliott Management, one of the five activist investors of note, has put forward its own slate of candidates for the board of directors. This move is aimed at gaining enough voting control to impose its agenda, which could have significant consequences for the future of Salesforce.Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff has stated that he does not mind activist investors circling his company, as long as they are knowledgeable and have the best interests of the company at heart. However, he has been dismissive of Strive Asset Management, which was co-founded by 2024 Republican presidential hopeful and Woke Inc. author Vivek Ramaswamy. In a recent interview, Benioff referred to Ramaswamy as ""just a politician."" He said that anyone can be an activist, but those who are using activism for their own political agenda are not beneficial to the company.In recent times, the management structure and the growth strategy of Salesforce have become a major concern for investors. Two co-CEOs left their position in just three years, and activist investors believe that the company's management structure needs to be reviewed.Additionally, the company's focus on profitability is another challenge it's facing. Salesforce has achieved meaningful growth through acquisitions, but as investors demanded answers about Salesforce's balance of growth and margins, the company is now more focused on increasing profit margins. This new focus will result in the company curbing spending and investment, which could make it harder for Salesforce to address emerging threats such as the evolution of a long-time partner into a competitor.Veeva Systems Inc. (NYSE:VEEV), a company that sells software to life sciences organizations, is one such long-time partner that built its core software on top of Salesforce's app-development platform. However, this relationship will come to an end in 2025, and the company has announced that the contract with Salesforce will not be renewed as it has built CRM software in-house. It would not be surprising if a few other customers decide to follow Veeva to manage the long-term costs associated with hiring a third-party CRM software solutions provider. While Veeva has agreed to pay Salesforce as its customers use Salesforce's platform, the costs have risen as more people have come to rely on Veeva. In exchange for Veeva's payments, Salesforce has agreed not to enter Veeva's specialized, regulated market. This agreement is becoming challenging as Veeva becomes profitable and is a publicly traded software company with a $28 billion market capitalization. The move to ditch Salesforce is seen as positive for Veevas customers as it simplifies their landscape. However, it remains to be seen whether other large Salesforce customers will follow Veeva's lead and whether Salesforce will be able to develop technology to address these emerging threats.TakeawayDespite Salesforce's strong financial performance and apparent potential for continued growth, the company is not entirely free from risks and challenges. Some of these include concerns over management structure, profitability and emerging competition. With the influence of activist investors and a new focus on short-term profitability, Salesforce may find it difficult to address new threats effectively. Nevertheless, the company continues to hold a significant position in the cloud software development industry, and its actions in the future will be worth observing as it confronts these challenges. Balancing growth with profit margins will be crucial for Salesforce as it navigates these hurdles.","March 23, 2023 at 1:34 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/salesforce-risks-looming-horizon-193406554.html,GuruFocus.com,0.0,0.0,0.2217075673244505,0.49864929442851513
CRM,10 Best Blue Chip Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds,"The market is more uncertain than it has been in a while.In early March, Silicon Valley Bank, the 16th largest bank by assets in the United States at the end of last year, failed. Later in the same month, UBS has had to buy out Credit Suisse given substantial capital flight in the latter in recent quarters.Meanwhile, inflation is still pretty high and the Federal Reserve is expected to continue to raise interest rates.Given the uncertainty, leading blue chips can be more attractive than average stocks.Blue chips are established companies that are generally well known and that have substantial competitive advantages.Many blue chips generally have an extensive history of profitability and have growth potential. Many blue chips also have considerable market capitalization that rank among the market's largest by that metric. Furthermore, many blue chips return excess capital back to shareholders either through dividend or share buybacks or both.Blue chips also face the same headwinds as the market.If the economy slows further given the interest rate increases, blue chip stocks might not do well. If valuations in the broader market decreases, the valuations of many blue chips could decrease too.Despite the uncertainty, some leading blue chips with competitive advantages are trading for pretty attractive valuations given the decline in the market over the past few years. Although there could be more downside in the near term, many leading blue chips could do well in the long term as the U.S. economy and global economy continues to grow.As a result of the uncertainty, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of leading stocks across many different sectors.christian-wiediger-rymh7EZPqRs-unsplashMethodologyFor our list of 10 Best Blue Chip Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds, we picked 10 blue chip stocks with competitive advantages that ranked among the top 25 most widely held stocks by elite funds in our database of 943 hedge funds at the end of Q4.We ranked each stock based on the number of hedge funds in our database that owned shares of the same stock at the end of the fourth quarter.Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 97S&P Global Inc.

CRM,3 Stocks With Superior Potential for Super-Sized Gains in 2023,"Stocks with potential are probably not everyone’s cup of tea right now. With talks of an impending recession, everyone is looking for safer options. However, Shelby Davis once famously said, “Invest for the long haul. Don’t get too greedy, and don’t get too scared.”Although stock indexes are lackluster, it’s important to think ahead to the next bull market, regardless of whether it’s imminent or further down the line. Focusing on the future will allow you to prepare your portfolio for the worst-case scenario. It will also position you for success when the market inevitably improves.Selecting the best stocks with potential can be challenging for investors. While some stocks with potential can offer rapid returns as optimism about the future rises, a souring outlook can lead to a significant decline in value. Therefore, it’s recommended that investors opt for proven companies with a track record of expansion and success.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWhile past performance does not guarantee future returns, it’s reasonable to assume that companies riding big-picture trends will probably continue growing as long as they persist. By prioritizing proven companies that align with mega-trends, investors can take a responsible approach to buy stocks with potential.EXASExact Sciences$65.53VVisa$219.25CRMSalesforce$185.36Source: Tada Images / ShutterstockThe company is addressing a critical and ongoing need in the healthcare industry with its innovative approach.

As a result, the company consistently achieves sales and profit growth. Because of the demographic shift in the United States towards an aging population, the outlook for increasing demand in the coming years is promising.Despite progress in reducing losses, the company’s financials still present a challenge, with a net loss of $127.7 million, or $0.72 per share, in the fourth quarter, compared to the previous year’s net loss of $220.6 million, or $1.28 per share. This financial setback might give some investors pause, especially given the current bearish market environment.Source: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.comCurrently, Visa’s stock is trading at a PE ratio of 30.4, which is a discount compared to its historical highs. Over the past ten years, Visa’s PE ratio range has been between 19.66 (minimum) and 84.19 (maximum), with a median of 33.07. Therefore, Visa’s current PE ratio is below its historical median, showing it may be undervalued.That opens up a great opportunity for you to look into Visa. Its latest financials confirm its health and vitality. Visa beat first quarter fiscal 2023 earnings estimates, fueled by a rise in cross-border travel.

CRM,Investors Heavily Search Salesforce Inc. (CRM): Here is What You Need to Know,"Shares of this customer-management software developer have returned +11.9% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -3.9% change. The Zacks Computer - Software industry, to which Salesforce.com belongs, has gained 5.9% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Salesforce.com is expected to post earnings of $1.59 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +62.2%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +61.6%.The consensus earnings estimate of $6.92 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +32.1%. This estimate has changed +51.5% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.65 indicates a change of +25% from what Salesforce.com is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +22.9%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Salesforce.com is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Salesforce.com, the consensus sales estimate of $8.17 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +10.2%. The $34.62 billion and $38.56 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +10.4% and +11.4%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistorySalesforce.com reported revenues of $8.38 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +14.4%. EPS of $1.68 for the same period compares with $0.84 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.99 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +4.99%. The EPS surprise was +24.44%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Salesforce.com is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Salesforce.com. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Salesforce Inc.

Gates explained. ""Once developers can generalize a learning algorithm and run it at the speed of a computer — an accomplishment that could be a decade away or a century away — we’ll have an incredibly powerful AGI [artificial general intelligence]. It will be able to do everything that a human brain can, but without any practical limits on the size of its memory or the speed at which it operates. This will be a profound change.""To be sure, Microsoft is making a huge bet today that the future will be heavily reliant on AI.This comes after Microsoft unveiled a $10 billion investment in OpenAI in late January.And Microsoft isn't alone in pushing the AI narrative with investors amid efforts to unlock greater tech spending among businesses and consumers.Gates wrote that new AI tools will go a long way to help improve learning and health care. At the same time, the tech pioneer stressed that there are risks associated with AI that governments and society at large will have to address.""There’s the possibility that AIs will run out of control,"" Gates noted.

CRM,Here's How Much a $1000 Investment in Salesforce.com Made 10 Years Ago Would Be Worth Today,"For most investors, how much a stock's price changes over time is important. Not only can it impact your investment portfolio, but it can also help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.FOMO, or the fear of missing out, also plays a role in investing, particularly with tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.What if you'd invested in Salesforce.com (CRM) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to CRM for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?Salesforce.com's Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at Salesforce.com's main business drivers.Headquartered in San Francisco, Salesforce, Inc., founded in 1999, is the leading provider of on-demand Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software, which enables organizations to better manage critical operations, such as sales force automation, customer service and support, marketing automation, document management, analytics and custom application development.Salesforce is currently the largest CRM vendor in the world with a market share of nearly 20% according to reports of Gartner, a global research and advisory firm. Its nearest rival, SAP is way behind at a market share of around 8%.  About 90% of the Fortune 100 companies uses at least one Salesforce software.The company has leveraged its expertise in on-demand software to increase the scale of operations. It also offers a technology platform for customers and developers to build and run business applications.Salesforce helps companies of every size and industry to connect with their customers in new ways through existing and emerging technologies including cloud, mobile, social, IoT and artificial intelligence (AI).Rapid digital transformation and the company’s sustained focus on introducing more aligned products as per customer needs is driving its revenues higher. Over the last eight years, Salesforce’s annual revenues have sextuple from $5.4 billion in fiscal 2015 to $31.4 billion in fiscal 2023.There are two main revenue streams — Subscription and Support and Professional Services & Other.Subscription revenues comprise subscription fees from customers, accessing the company’s enterprise cloud computing services (Cloud Services), software licenses and subscription fees recognized from customers for additional support beyond the standard support lent by the company. This segment accounted for more than 93% of Salesforce’s fiscal 2023 revenues.Professional Services & Other revenues consist of fees that the company derives from consulting and implementation services and training. This segment accounted for the remaining 7% of Salesforce’s fiscal 2023 revenues.Bottom LineWhile anyone can invest, building a lucrative investment portfolio takes research, patience, and a little bit of risk. If you had invested in Salesforce.com ten years ago, you're probably feeling pretty good about your investment today.According to our calculations, a $1000 investment made in March 2013 would be worth $4,244.76, or a 324.48% gain, as of March 17, 2023. Investors should keep in mind that this return excludes dividends but includes price appreciation.In comparison, the S&P 500 gained 153.75% and the price of gold went up 15.95% over the same time frame.Going forward, analysts are expecting more upside for CRM.Salesforce is benefiting from a robust demand environment as customers are undergoing a major digital transformation. The rapid adoption of its cloud-based solutions is driving demand for its products. Its sustained focus on introducing more aligned products as per customer needs is driving its top-line. Continued deal wins in the international market is another growth driver. The acquisition of Slack would position the company to be a leader in enterprise team collaboration solution space and better compete with Microsoft’s Teams product. We expect CRM revenues to grow at a CAGR of 11.2% through fiscal 2024-2026. However, stiff competition and unfavorable currency fluctuations are concerns. Besides, challenging macroeconomic environment might hurt its growth prospects In the near-term.Over the past four weeks, shares have rallied 11.41%, and there have been 16 higher earnings estimate revisions in the past two months for fiscal 2023 compared to none lower. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.Salesforce Inc.

Software is ubiquitous and has become the focal point of technological innovation. Apart from running devices and applications, its usage has been extended to managing infrastructure. The industry is primarily gaining from the ongoing cloud transition.The Zacks Computer Software industry includes companies that provide software applications related to cloud computing, electronic design automation (mostly for semiconductor and electronics industries), digital media and marketing, customer relationship management, on-premises and cloud-based database management, accounting and tax purposes, human capital management, cybersecurity and application performance monitoring and cloud-based enterprise communications platform.Some companies develop and market simulation software (like computer-aided design or CAD, 3D modeling, product lifecycle management or PLM, data orchestration and experience creation), which engineers, designers and researchers use across various industries like architecture, engineering and construction, product design, manufacturing and digital media.The deployment time is also much shorter compared with legacy systems. SaaS companies are expected to register strong top-line growth on a higher percentage of recurring revenues, subscription gross margin and a lower churn rate.This trend has brought immense value to application and infrastructure performance monitoring. It is driving the demand for performance management monitoring tools that are scalable and suitable for cloud-based environments.The Zacks Computer Software industry is housed within the broader Zacks Computer And Technology sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #87, which places it in the top 35% of more than 249 Zacks industries.The group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bright near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Before we present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, considering bright prospects, let us look at the industry's recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.The Zacks Computer Software industry has outperformed the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector and the S&P 500 Index in the past year.The industry has lost 7.3% over this period compared with the S&P 500 and the broader sector' decline of 9.4% and 12%, respectively.On the basis of forward 12-month P/E, a commonly-used multiple for valuing software companies, we see that the industry is currently trading at 26.39X compared with the S&P 500's 15.99X. It is also above the sector's forward-12-month P/E of 21.72X.In the last five years, the industry has traded as high as 37.28X, as low as 22.63X and at the median of 27.55X.Salesforce benefits from a robust demand environment as customers are undergoing a major digital transformation. The rapid adoption of its cloud-based solutions is driving demand for its products. Its sustained focus on introducing more aligned products as per customer needs is driving its top line. Continued deal wins in the international market are another growth driver. The acquisition of Slack elevates the company's position in enterprise team collaboration solution space.The consensus mark for the company's fiscal 2024 earnings is pegged at $6.96 per share, up 21.3% in the past 60 days. The long-term growth rate is pegged at 16.8%.Cadence's performance is gaining from continued strength across all segments owing to healthy demand for the company's diversified product portfolio. The company is likely to benefit from long-term secular mega-trends that boosts design activity growth across semiconductor and system companies.The company's Palladium and Protium platform is gaining traction among clients in the hyperscale, HPC and auto EV segments. The company is expanding its digital software business by developing front-end Genus and Joules tools and signoff products like Tempus and Quantus. Apart from that, strategic collaborations and acquisitions are expected to help the company sustain top-line growth.The consensus mark for this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company's 2023 earnings is pegged at $4.97 per share, indicating year-over-year growth of 16.4%. Shares have gained 35.3% in the past year. The long-term growth rate is pegged at 19.1%.Blackbaud's performance is being driven by higher contractual recurring revenue owing to synergies from the previous acquisition of EVERFI. Increasing customer renewal rates and booking coupled with frequent product launches bodes well. The growing demand for cloud-based applications is likely to act as a tailwind. The company's efforts to return capital to its shareholders through share repurchase and deleveraging augurs well in the long term. The company's margins are likely to improve owing to cost control and operational improvements.Blackbaud carries a Zacks Rank #2. The consensus mark for the company's 2023 earnings is pegged at $3.43 per share, up 27.5% year over year. The long-term growth rate is pegged at 15.6%.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

AMD,"Is Trending Stock Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) a Buy Now?","Shares of this chipmaker have returned -2.8% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.2% change. The Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry, to which Advanced Micro belongs, has lost 3.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Advanced Micro is expected to post earnings of $0.57 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -45.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -14.8%.The consensus earnings estimate of $2.84 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -18.9%. This estimate has changed -9.5% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.93 indicates a change of +38.5% from what Advanced Micro is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -5.1%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Advanced Micro.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Advanced Micro, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $5.33 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -18.7%. For the current and next fiscal years, $22.97 billion and $26.41 billion estimates indicate -2.7% and +15% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryAdvanced Micro reported revenues of $5.35 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -9.1%. EPS of $0.60 for the same period compares with $1.13 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.3 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.91%. The EPS surprise was +7.14%.Over the last four quarters, Advanced Micro surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Advanced Micro is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Advanced Micro. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

AMD,This week in tech: A banner week for Apple; whiplash for AMD,"By Louis JuricicInvesting.com -- Here is your weekly Pro Recap on the past week's most momentous tech headlines: Solid earnings out of Apple and Square, a whipsaw week for AMD, soft guidance from Qualcomm, and a narrower loss than expected at Coinbase.On Thursday Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) topped first-quarter estimates with earnings per share of $1.54 vs. the $1.43 average analyst estimate, driven by stronger-than-expected iPhone sales.Apple also boosted its dividend and announced a $90 billion share buyback program.Goldman Sachs raised the price target to $209 per share on Buy-rated AAPL stock after ""strong"" results:""We gain confidence in our Buy rating and believe AAPL shares continue to be attractive.""KeyBanc also hiked the price target, to $180 per share from the prior $177, noting that Emerging Markets strength a the tech giant offloaded weaker U.S. results.Shares were up more than 2% for the week.Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) reported a better-than-expected Q1 on Tuesday but issued disappointing guidance, triggering a 9% selloff in the shares in the next session.BofA cut the stock to Neutral from Buy, citing a ""range of headwinds"" including ""aggressive pricing/promotion pressure from main rival Intel (NASDAQ:INTC).""Citi, for its part, raised the price target on AMD stock to $85 per share, and BMO highlighted the company's continued market share gains against Intel.Then, on Thursday afternoon, shares clawed most of their way back following a story from Bloomberg that said Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is helping finance AMD’s expansion into AI chips.Microsoft and AMD have teamed to create an alternative to Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) processors for artificial intelligence, the report said, citing people with knowledge of the matter. Microsoft will provide financial support to bolster AMD’s efforts, as it works with the chipmaker on a homegrown Microsoft processor for AI workloads.AMD shares were ultimately off about 1% for the week.Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) shares slid after the company forecasted far lower-than-anticipated results for is fiscal third quarter: The company expects 3Q23 EPS in the range of $1.70-$1.90, compared with the consensus of $2.20, and revenue in the range of $8.1-8.9B, compared to the consensus of $9.25B.Q2 earnings of $2.15 per share were in line with expectations.The company said demand for smartphones had deteriorated as China remains weak, calling the macroeconomic environment ""challenging.""Deutsche called the guidance ""disappointing by any measure"" but also believes the company ""should be an attractive beneficiary of the eventual cyclical rebound once one actually occurs (not a matter of if, but rather when).""Shares sank more than 7% for the week.Block (NYSE:SQ) shares initially bumped higher after the fintech name reported better-than-expected Q1 results: earnings per share of $0.40 vs. Wall Street's estimate of $0.35, and above-par revenue of $4.99 billion.For the full year, the company raised its full-year adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) forecast to $1.36 billion, up from the prior $1.3B.Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan were both positive on the stock after earnings. JPMorgan sees more room for further upside, calling its operating leverage potential ""underappreciated by the market."" It added, ""SQ remains one of our favorite ideas.""For the week, though, shares slipped 2.5%.Coinbase's Q1 results were better than feared, driven by cost cuts and a jump in subscription revenue: The company lost just $0.34 per share, far better than expectations for $1.39 in the red.After its Thursday report, shares were trading about 9% higher.Looking ahead, the company said it expected subscription and services revenue to fall in the second quarter. For the full year it continues to seek to improve full-year 2023 adjusted EBITDA in absolute dollar terms versus full-year 2022.BofA said the results were solid but that big fundamental questions remain unanswered about the company, and maintained its Underperform rating on Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN): ""We continue to think retail crypto volumes will remain weak and the regulatory overhang will linger for some time,"" the analyst said in a note.Barclays lowered the price target to $61 from $74 per share. The analyst highlighted an uplift in retail take rate, while also noting that this trend may not prove to be sustainable.Senad Karaahmetovic and Davit Kirakosyan contributed to this report.Related ArticlesThis week in tech: A banner week for Apple; whiplash for AMDBinance resumes Bitcoin withdrawals after temporary closure4 big deal reports: More tremors across regional banks","May 7, 2023 at 12:07 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/week-tech-banner-week-apple-170723589.html,Investing.com,0.0,0.0,0.11254545454545456,0.47724242424242425

AMD,"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AMD) Fundamentals Look Pretty Strong: Could The Market Be Wrong About The Stock?","Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. See our latest analysis for Advanced Micro Devices Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Advanced Micro Devices is:0.7% = US$395m ÷ US$55b (Based on the trailing twelve months to April 2023).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.01.Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.It is quite clear that Advanced Micro Devices' ROE is rather low. Even compared to the average industry ROE of 17%, the company's ROE is quite dismal. In spite of this, Advanced Micro Devices was able to grow its net income considerably, at a rate of 41% in the last five years. Therefore, there could be other reasons behind this growth. Such as - high earnings retention or an efficient management in place.Next, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Advanced Micro Devices' growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 31% in the same period, which is great to see.Advanced Micro Devices doesn't pay any dividend currently which essentially means that it has been reinvesting all of its profits into the business. This definitely contributes to the high earnings growth number that we discussed above.","May 5, 2023 at 9:00 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/advanced-micro-devices-inc-nasdaq-140030175.html,Simply Wall St.,0.14583333333333331,0.8083333333333333,0.10463414634146344,0.43680023228803705
AMD,10 Best International Index Funds To Buy,"While shares of the duo are traded on American exchanges, a variety of other important firms, particularly those in the world's second largest economy China, are not. This makes for an important argument for investing in foreign markets, supplemented by the fact that economic downturns in America might not be replicated in other countries - and investing in foreign stocks could prove to be an effective way to protect one's portfolio (or even grow it) during an economic downturn.For some time, the forecast for the U.S. economy prepared by the staff had featured subdued real GDP growth for this year and some softening in the labor market. Given their assessment of the potential economic effects of the recent banking-sector developments, the staff’s projection at the time of the March meeting included a mild recession starting later this year, with a recovery over the subsequent two years. Real GDP growth in 2024 was projected to remain below the staff’s estimate of potential output growth, and then GDP growth in 2025 was expected to be above that of potential. Resource utilization in both product and labor markets was forecast to be much less tight than in the January projection. The level of real output was projected to move below the staff’s estimate of potential output in early 2024, more than a year sooner than in the previous projection. Likewise, the unemployment rate was projected to rise above the staff’s estimate of its natural rate early next year.So, if there's a recession in the U.S., where the rates have been raised higher than in other regions, then foreign investing makes more sense. At the same time, another key reason many institutional investors invest abroad is that emerging markets often give higher returns than developed markets. Of course, most of these investments are in bonds with fixed interest rates, but the business potential in emerging markets can contribute to firms operating in those areas seeing big gains in their share price.. . . The Fed wasn't really going, in May I point that Jerome Powell said . . we aren't even considering 75 basis point hikes. Then in June they rose rates, overnight lending rates, by 75 basis points, the next meeting 75 basis points, the next meeting 75 basis points, the next meeting 75 basis points. He said that in May. Market fell to October. They're still raising rates. Where are we now in the market? Where we were in May! You follow that. . . .If don't fight the Fed worked, you should have gotten out of the market then, and not got back in.

AMD,AMDs AI Progress Wins Over Traders Seeking More Than Just Promises,"(Bloomberg) -- Promises of a future when artificial intelligence drives a surge in sales for chipmakers are no longer cutting it in the stock market. These days, hard evidence of progress toward that is needed.Most Read from BloombergPeter Thiel Says Moving to Florida from Silicon Valley Is Too ExpensiveHeavy Marijuana Use Increases Schizophrenia in Men, Study FindsSEC Investigates Trades by First Republic Executives Before Sale to JPMorganBruised Banks Fuel Short-Covering Rally in Stocks: Markets WrapBMW Warns Owners ‘Do Not Drive’ 90,000 Cars Recalled Over Defective AirbagTake the case of Advanced Micro Devices Inc. The stock jumped 6.1% on Thursday on news it’s working with Microsoft Corp. on technology for AI workloads to rival those from Nvidia Corp. That almost erased losses suffered a day earlier after a weak revenue forecast overshadowed assurances from Chief Executive Officer Lisa Su that AMD is well positioned to capitalize on growth in AI computing.Chip-related stocks have emerged this year as a popular way for investors to gain exposure to AI after the adoption of OpenAI’s ChatGPT created a trader frenzy. The biggest beneficiary so far has been Nvidia, whose shares are up 90% this year in a reflection of its market dominance. As its only real rival in the type of graphics chips that data center owners are increasingly turning to, AMD has gained 32%.“AI deserves all the hype it gets and more,” said Olivier Sarfati, head of equities at GenTrust. “Money is going to be made in processors, cloud services, data center, to say nothing of industries in general.”Still, just talking about a company’s capabilities for AI computing isn’t getting the rosy reception from investors it once did. In the absence of new developments, market watchers are turning their gaze to a more immediate issue — weak demand for personal computers and smartphones.The work with Microsoft doesn’t change much right now for AMD fundamentally, according to Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon, and on Friday AMD shares slipped back 1.8%. Instead, it offers “a narrative boost as they try to shift the story toward AI,” he wrote in a note.To that end, AMD’s Su dedicated a large chunk of this week’s earnings call to AI. The area is the company’s “number one strategic priority,” she told analysts, highlighted by the more than 50 mentions of the term ‘AI’ on the call.Underlining the trend, Qualcomm Inc. CEO Cristiano Amon also talked up his company’s AI bona fides on the chipmaker’s earnings call on Wednesday. Yet that wasn’t enough to stop the stock from falling more than 5% the following day after a quarterly revenue forecast that trailed estimates.Chegg’s 50% Wipeout Shows Shock of AI Colliding With US BusinessThe true test of whether investors are now turning a deaf ear to promises of future AI business will come later this month when Nvidia reports. The surge in its shares has added $330 billion in market capitalization and made the company the sixth most-valuable in the S&P 500.Even more remarkable is that the rally has come amid falling sales. Nvidia’s revenue has been hurt by the slump in personal computers and is expected to have dropped 22% in the first quarter, according to the average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.Three months ago when Nvidia last reported earnings the term ‘AI’ was used more than 80 times on its conference call with analysts. While CEO Jensen Huang has earned the right to talk about the subject more than anyone else, there’ll be more pressure than ever to keep proving it’s translating into real earnings growth.Tech Chart of the DayThe Nasdaq 100 Index is coming off a four-day drop, the longest such streak for the tech-heavy index since a five-day decline that ended in December. While the streak is the longest of the year, the scale is relatively muted; the gauge only declined 2% during the current slump. The index remains up about 19% this year, and recently closed at its highest since August. The index rose 0.9% on Friday.Top Tech StoriesSales of Apple Inc.’s iPhone rebounded last quarter, helping the world’s most valuable company top earnings estimates and weather an industrywide downturn that has battered much of its product lineup.Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook expressed cautious optimism about the flood of new artificial intelligence services, saying that while the technology has huge potential, there also are “a number of issues that need to be sorted.”Cook singled out India as pivotal for the iPhone maker, underscoring how the world’s most populous country is on the cusp of becoming both a major market and production base.A senior software engineer at Google wrote a critique asserting that the internet search leader is losing its edge in artificial intelligence to the open-source community, where many independent researchers use AI technology to make rapid and unexpected advances.Tesla Inc. raised the prices of its premium models in China, following a small increase in the cost of its top-selling Model 3 and Model Y earlier in the week.Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.’s international online shopping unit is exploring a US initial public offering as it weighs options to spur growth for the business that includes major e-commerce brands Lazada and AliExpress.--With assistance from Ryan Vlastelica and Subrat Patnaik.(Updates to market open.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekAirbus Bets on a Stretched A220 Jet to Beat Boeing’s 737How a Dishwasher Engineer Challenged Elon Musk’s Grip on Commercial SpaceEven $500 Million a Year From Google Isn’t Enough to Save FirefoxData Science Is the Hot New Master’s at B-SchoolsToo Big to Fail, But Not Too Big to Bail Out Other Banks©2023 Bloomberg L.P.","May 5, 2023 at 8:40 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amd-ai-progress-wins-over-134007274.html,Bloomberg,0.4,0.35,0.09607195013821519,0.44283497626871116

AMD,Microsoft Working With AMD on Expansion Into AI Processors,"(Bloomberg) -- Microsoft Corp. is working with Advanced Micro Devices Inc. on the chipmaker’s expansion into artificial intelligence processors, according to people with knowledge of the situation, part of a multipronged strategy to secure more of the highly coveted components.Most Read from BloombergPeter Thiel Says Moving to Florida from Silicon Valley Is Too ExpensiveApple Shares Rise After iPhone Bounces Back, Sales Top EstimatesJPMorgan Sees Investors Moving to Gold, Tech Amid Recession RiskChina Takes the Yuan Global in Bid to Repel a Weaponized DollarHeavy Marijuana Use Increases Schizophrenia in Men, Study FindsThe companies are teaming up to offer an alternative to Nvidia Corp., which dominates the market for AI-capable chips called graphics processing units, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the matter is private. The software giant is providing support to bolster AMD’s efforts, including engineering resources, and working with the chipmaker on a homegrown Microsoft processor for AI workloads, code-named Athena, the people said.Frank Shaw, a Microsoft spokesman, denied that AMD is part of Athena. “AMD is a great partner,” he said. “However, they are not involved in Athena.”AMD shares jumped more than 6.5% on Thursday, and Microsoft gained about 1%. AMD representatives declined to comment. Nvidia stock declined 1.9%.The arrangement is part of a broader rush to augment AI processing power, which is in great demand after the explosion of chatbots like ChatGPT and other services based on the technology. Microsoft is both a top provider of cloud-computing services and a driving force of AI use. The company has pumped $10 billion into ChatGPT maker OpenAI, and has vowed to add such features to its entire software lineup.Read More: Microsoft to Bring OpenAI’s Chatbot Technology to Office AppsThe move also reflects Microsoft’s deepening involvement in the chip industry. The company has been building up a silicon division over the past several years under former Intel Corp. executive Rani Borkar, and the group now has a staff of almost 1,000 employees. The Information last month reported on Microsoft’s development of the Athena artificial-intelligence chip.Several hundred of those employees are working on the Athena project, and Microsoft has spent about $2 billion on its chip efforts, according to one of the people. But the undertaking doesn’t portend a split with Nvidia. Microsoft intends to keep working closely with that company, whose chips are the workhorses for training and running AI systems. It’s also trying to find ways to get more Nvidia’s processors, underscoring the urgent shortage Microsoft and others are facing.Microsoft’s relationship with OpenAI — and its own slate of newly introduced AI services — are requiring computing power at a level beyond what the company expected when it ordered chips and set up data centers. OpenAI’s ChatGPT service has drawn interest from businesses that want to use it as part of their own products or corporate applications, and Microsoft has introduced a chat-based version of Bing and new AI-enhanced Office tools.It’s also updating older products like GitHub’s code-generating tool. All of those AI programs run in Microsoft’s Azure cloud and require the pricey and powerful processors Nvidia provides.The area is also a key priority for AMD. “We are very excited about our opportunity in AI — this is our No. 1 strategic priority,” Chief Executive Officer Lisa Su said during the chipmaker’s earnings call Tuesday. “We are in the very early stages of the AI computing era, and the rate of adoption and growth is faster than any other technology in recent history.”Su also said that AMD has an opportunity to make partly customized chips for its biggest customers to use in their AI data centers.From Bloomberg Businessweek: Doing, Not Just Chatting, Is the Next Stage of the AI Hype CycleBorkar’s team at Microsoft, which has also worked on chips for servers and Surface computers, is now prioritizing the Athena project. It’s developing a graphics processing unit that can be used for training and running AI models. The product is already being tested internally and could be more widely available as soon as next year, said one of the people.Even if the project makes that timeline, a first version is just a starting point, the people said. It takes years to build a good chip, and Nvidia has a substantial head start. Nvidia is the chip supplier of choice for many providers of tools for generative AI, including Amazon.com Inc.’s AWS and Google cloud, and Elon Musk has secured thousands of its processors for his fledgling AI business, according to reports.Creating an alternative to Nvidia’s lineup will be a challenging task. That company offers a package of software and hardware that works together — including chips, a programming language, networking equipment and servers — letting customers rapidly upgrade their capabilities.That’s one of the reasons Nvidia has become so dominant. But Microsoft isn’t alone in trying to develop in-house AI processors. Cloud rival Amazon acquired Annapurna Labs in 2016 and has developed two different AI processors. Alphabet Inc.’s Google also has a training chip of its own.(Adds Microsoft comment in third paragraph.

AMD,4 big earnings hits: Apple comes out on top; AMD dives on weak outlook | Pro Recap,"Investing.com -- Here is your Pro Recap of the biggest earnings reports you may have missed this week: Cheery news from Apple and Pfizer, dour guidance at AMD, and sliding shares at Starbucks despite an earnings beat.""We are pleased to report an all-time record in services and a March quarter record for iPhone despite the challenging macroeconomic environment, and to have our installed base of active devices reach an all-time high,"" CEO Tim Cook said.The company also unveiled a $90B share buyback plan and boosted its quarterly dividend by a penny to 24 cents per share.Shares were rising 2.5% in recent premarket trading Friday.EPS for Q1 was $0.60, better than the consensus estimate of $0.56, and revenue of $5.4B edged out the $5.3B forecast.But sluggish Q2 sales guidance prompted Bank of America to downgrade the stock to Hold from Buy and to trim its price target to $95 from the prior $98.BofA sees a ""range of headwinds"" for the company, including ""aggressive pricing/promotion pressure from main rival {Intel,"" as well as concerns on second-half data center growth, lackluster positioning in AI accelerators, and limited room for further expansion in its price-to-earnings multiple until revenue ""re-accelerates back to historical levels.""The numbers were driven by growth in its core North America market and a rebound in China. Comparable-store sales, or sales at locations open a year or more, climbed 11%.Starbucks also reaffirmed its 2023 outlook on the earnings call. JPMorgan said the results were strong but that the full-year guidance was likely not enough to please investors, noting:""People were very focused on 'macro uncertainty' tempering US results, China recovery, and a variety of near term expense investments intended to drive medium term productivity that served to constrain any expected upside in F23.""Morgan Stanley also surmised that investors likely wanted more from the company. As far as Q1 is concerned, though, it said Starbucks delivered ""an impressive quarter by most measures"" and that ""key fundamental drivers remain intact.""Sales fell 29% year-over-year as Pfizer generated 77% less from its COVID-19 revenue.

AMD,3 Stocks That Moved Wildly in Today's Session,"It’s no secret that large price swings are commonly seen in the market post-earnings or following news headlines, with market participants reacting quickly in response.And today, we’ve seen several stocks undergo volatility in the session, including Advanced Micro Devices AMD, Starbucks SBUX, and Meta Platforms META. AMD and SBUX shares are experiencing volatility post-earnings, whereas META shares are undergoing volatility following an FTC announcement.Below is a chart illustrating the performance of all three year-to-date, with the S&P 500 blended in as a benchmark.Let’s take a closer look at why these stocks are moving in today’s session.Meta PlatformsMETA shares witnessed volatility following an announcement from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). The FTC proposed modifications to its original 2020 privacy order with the company, with the agency claiming that it’s failed to comply with the order in its entirety.As part of these changes, Meta would no longer be allowed to monetize youth data (those under 18). Samuel Levine, Director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said, “The company’s recklessness has put young users at risk, and Facebook needs to answer for its failures.”Following the headline, META shares faced selling pressure but have since bounced from their intraday lows.Meta Platforms’ latest quarterly print caught the attention of nearly all market participants, delivering a solid 35% EPS surprise and revealing optimistic guidance. Quarterly revenue totaled $28.6 billion, above expectations, reflecting the first Y/Y revenue increase in four quarters.Analysts have raised their earnings expectations for the technology titan over the last several months, helping land the stock into the highly-coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Advanced Micro DevicesDespite posting a double-beat, Advanced Micro Devices shares faced volatility post-earnings in yesterday’s after-hours session. Shares have faced adverse price action throughout trading so far, down roughly 8% from yesterday’s close.AMD posted earnings of $0.60 per share, exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate by roughly 7%. Quarterly revenue totaled $5.4 billion, modestly ahead of expectations and 9% lower than the year-ago figure of $5.9 billion.However, a part of the quarterly release that spooked market participants was the results from AMD’s Client segment, which includes revenue from PC processors. Client segment revenue totaled $739 million, down 65% year-over-year as PC shipments have rapidly declined. Analysts have had a bearish stance on the company’s earnings outlook as of late, with AMD’s earnings outlook shifting negatively across nearly all timeframes.StarbucksLike AMD, Starbucks posted better-than-expected results, exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate by more than 15%. Quarterly revenue totaled $8.7 billion, 4% above expectations and improving 14% year-over-year.There were also several notable highlights from the release, including –North America comparable store sales increased 12% year-over-year, and China comparable store sales saw year-over-year growth of 3%, both driven by an increase in comparable transactions. Further, the company opened 464 net new stores throughout the quarter, bringing the total tally to 36,434 stores globally.Still, despite posting overall positive results, the company didn’t lift its guidance, perhaps spooking some investors. The adverse price action could be a reflection of profit-taking, as SBUX shares were up 15% year-to-date prior to the earnings release.Bottom LineOn any given day, we see large price swings within the market, whether that’s in response to a news headline or quarterly results.And all three stocks above – Advanced Micro Devices AMD, Starbucks SBUX, and Meta Platforms META – experienced volatile price action in today’s session.Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

AMD,RPT-US STOCKS-Wall Street ends down on nagging uncertainty about Fed rate path,"(Repeats to fix technical problem)*Fed raises rates by 25 basis points*Advanced Micro Devices shares fall after outlook*Financials, energy down the most among sectors*Indexes: Dow down 0.8%, S&P 500 down 0.7%, Nasdaq down 0.5%By Caroline ValetkevitchNEW YORK May 3 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks ended lower on Wednesday, reversing gains after comments by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell left investors wondering what the U.S. central bank's next move would be with interest rate hikes. Indexes initially held onto gains following the Fed's statement. It increased interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point, as expected, and signaled it could pause further hikes.The unanimous decision lifted the U.S. central bank's benchmark overnight interest rate to the 5.00%-5.25% range, the 10th consecutive increase since March 2022.Stocks started to swoon after the press conference following the statement. Powell said the Fed still views inflation as too high, and said it was too soon to say the rate hike cycle is over.""The Fed continues to walk the tightrope, and that is they're trying to strike a balance between their inflation fighting credibility while trying to engineer a soft landing,"" said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors in Boston.All of the major S&P 500 sectors ended lower, with energy and financials down the most.

Indexes initially held onto gains following the Fed's statement. It increased interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point, as expected, and signaled it could pause further hikes.The unanimous decision lifted the U.S. central bank's benchmark overnight interest rate to the 5.00%-5.25% range, the 10th consecutive increase since March 2022.Stocks started to swoon after the press conference following the statement. Powell said the Fed still views inflation as too high, and said it was too soon to say the rate hike cycle is over.""The Fed continues to walk the tightrope, and that is they're trying to strike a balance between their inflation fighting credibility while trying to engineer a soft landing,"" said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors in Boston.All of the major S&P 500 sectors ended lower, with energy and financials down the most.

AMD,AMD And Intel Top Expectations Despite The PC Market Crash And Economic Slowdown,"Revenue for the first three months of the year tanked 9% to $5.35 billion while CNBC reported analyst expectations averaged to $5.3 billion. Unlike the net income of $786 million, or 56 cents per share that AMD earned during last year’s comparable quarter, this time it made a net loss of $139 million, or 9 cents per share. The adjusted EPS amounted to 60 cents per share, topping the expected 56 cents.The group where sales from PC processors belong to marked the biggest decline as revenue dropped nearly 65% YoY to $739 million, significantly below the expected $908 billion, according to Bloomberg.The Data Center unit generated $1.29 billion in revenue, also below the expected $1.46 billion.AMD CEO Lisa Su noted that growth is expected in the second half of the year as the PC and server markets recover. Su finds that AMD performed very well in a mixed demand environment where the PC market is having one of the worst times in its history. Despite falling short on both data center and client revenue, AMD topped both top and bottom line expectations.

HuRuth CotterThank you, Jean. And Kevin, we're happy to pull the audience for questions.Operator(Operator Instructions) Our first question today is coming from the Vivek Arya from Bank of America.Vivek AryaLisa SuVivek AryaAll right. And for my follow-up, Lisa, how do you see the market share evolve in the Data Center in the second half? Do you think that the competitive gap between you and your competitors' products, has that narrowed? Or you still think that in the second half, you have a chance to gain market share in the Data Center?Lisa SuOperatorNext question is coming from Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs.Toshiya HariLisa, I wanted to ask about the Embedded business. It's been a really strong business for you since the acquisition of Xilinx. You're guiding the business down sequentially in Q2. Is this sort of the macro/cycle kicking in? Or is it something supply related? If you can kind of expand on the Q2 outlook there and your expectations for the second half, that would be helpful.Lisa SuToshiya HariThat's helpful. And then as my follow-up, maybe one for Jean on the gross margin side of things. In your slide deck, I think you're guiding gross margins up half over half in the second half. Can you maybe speak to the puts and takes and the drivers as you think about gross margins over the next 6 to 9 months?Jean X. HuOperatorNext question is coming from Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo.Aaron Christopher RakersI've got 2 as well. I guess the first question going back on just like the cadence of the server CPU cycle with Genoa and Bergamo. And I think it's great to hear that you guys are on track to launch Bergamo here. But there's been some discussion here throughout this last quarter around some DDR5 challenges. I think there's PMEC issues. I'm just curious of how you -- if those issues have presented themselves or how you would characterize the cadence of the ramp cycle of Genoa at this point?Lisa SuAaron Christopher RakersAnd anything specific on the DDR5 questions that come up? And then I'm curious, but my second question just real quick is the MI300. If we look out beyond just the El Capitan deployment through the course of this year, how do you guys think about success in that data center GPU market [and do] we think about beyond just El Capitan?Lisa SuOperatorNext question is coming from Matt Ramsay from TD Cowen.Matthew D. RamsayLisa SuMatthew D. RamsayLisa, that's helpful. For my follow-up question, I think in the prepared scripts, we're obviously undershipping sell-through to clear the channel in the Client business in the first half of the year. And I think the language that was used was seasonal improvements in the second half. So are you guys expecting to come back to shipping in line with sell-through, so to stop under-shipping demand? And then for on top of that seasonal improvements in the market? Or -- and if you could just kind of help me think about the magnitude and the moving pieces in Client for the second half?Lisa SuOperatorYour next question is coming from Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley.Joseph Lawrence MooreYes, I guess same question in terms of the cloud business. You mentioned some combination of kind of digestion of spending and inventory reduction. Can you give us a sense of how much inventory was there in hyperscale? How much has it come down? And how much are you sort of maybe undershipping demand in that segment?Lisa SuJoseph Lawrence MooreGreat. And then for my follow-up, I mean, you mentioned interest in MI300 around generative AI. Can you talk to -- is that right now kind of a revenue pipeline with major hyperscalers? Or is that sort of more indication of interest level? Just trying to figure out where you are in terms of establishing yourself in that market?Lisa SuOperatorNext question is coming from Harlan Sur from JPMorgan.Harlan SurGood to see the strong dynamics in Embedded, very diverse end markets. And given their strong market share position here, the Valens team is in a really good position to catalyze EPYC attach or Ryzen attached to their FPGA and adaptive compute solutions, right? I think embedded x86 is like a $6 billion to $8 billion per year market opportunity. So, Lisa, given you're a year with Xilinx in the portfolio, can you just give us an update on the synergy unlock and driving higher AMD compute attached to Xilinx sockets?Lisa SuHarlan SurGreat. And in terms of other opportunities, there appears to be this trend towards more of your cloud and hyperscale customers opting to do their own silicon solutions around accelerated compute or AI offload engines, right? And if I look at it right, there are less than a handful of the world's semiconductor companies that have the compute, graphics, connectivity IP portfolio that you guys have as well as the capabilities to design these very complex offload SoCs, right? Does the team have a strategy to try and go after some of the semi-custom or full-blown ASIC-based hyperscale programs?Lisa SuWe do, Harlan, and I would put it more broadly. And the more -- the broader point is, I think we have a very complete IP portfolio across CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, adaptive SoCs, DPUs and a very capable semi-custom team. And so beyond hyperscalers, I think when we look at sort of higher volume opportunities, we think there are higher volume opportunities beyond game consoles, that there are custom opportunities available. So I think that combination of IP is very helpful. I think it's a long-term opportunity for us, and it's one of the areas where we think we can add value to our largest customers.OperatorNext question is coming from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank.Ross Clark SeymoreLisa SuRoss Clark SeymoreLisa SuOperatorNext question is coming from Timothy Arcuri from UBS.Timothy Michael ArcuriLisa, there was a lot more talk on this call about AI. And obviously, PyTorch 2.0 now supporting ROCm is a great step forward. But how much would you say software is going to dictate how successful you can be for these workloads? You had mentioned that you're forming this new group, this new AI group. Do you have the internal software capabilities to be successful in AI?Lisa SuTimothy Michael ArcuriAnd I guess as my follow-up. So can I -- can you just give us a sense of sort of the overall profile that you see for revenue into the back half? I know you said that Data Center and Embedded will be up this year. It sounds like Data Center probably up double digits. But I also wanted to confirm that you think that total revenues also will be up this year year-over-year.Lisa SuRight, Tim. So I think as we said, we're not guiding the full year just given all the puts and takes. So we see Q2 is flattish, second half return to growth. We'll have to see exactly how the macro plays out across PCs and enterprise. But yes, we feel good about growth in Embedded, growth in Data Center -- on the data center side, double-digit growth sort of half year-over-year. And then we'll see how the rest of the segments play out.OperatorYour next question is coming from Ambrish Srivastava from BMO Capital Markets.Ambrish SrivastavaLisa SuYes. Let me make sure I get your question, Ambrish. So you're asking about Q1 Data Center and whether we think we've lost share on a sequential basis?Ambrish SrivastavaRight. If I look at just your report versus what Intel reported on a Q-over-Q basis, and clearly on a year-over-year basis, you have gained share. But I'm just comparing down $14 million versus what you reported, and so that would imply that you had a share loss versus them, unless the Data Center GPU and the Xilinx business was down significantly also on a Q-over-Q basis.Jean X. HuYes. Ambrish, maybe I'll give you a little bit of color. It's definitely in Q1, the other networking business, including GPU, have been down. That definitely is the case. But from a share perspective, when we look at overall Q1 reported revenue from both sides and analyze the data, we don't believe we lost the share.Lisa SuYes, that's right, Ambrish. So I think you just have to go through each of the pieces. But I think from an EPYC or a server standpoint, we don't believe we lost share. If anything, we might have gained a little bit. But I think overall, I wouldn't look at it so closely on a quarter-by-quarter basis because there are puts and takes. From what we see overall, we believe that we have a good overall share progression as we go through the year.Ambrish SrivastavaAnd then the underlying assumptions for full year for Data Center?Lisa SuUnderlying assumptions for the full year. I think the key pieces that I talked about are Q2, let's call it, modest growth. We still expect some cloud optimization to be happening. As we go into the second half of the year, we'll see a stronger ramp of Genoa and the beginnings of the ramp of Bergamo. We think enterprise is still more dependent on macro, but we do believe that, that improves as we go into the second half of the year. And then we'll have the beginnings of our MI300 ramped in the fourth quarter for both supercomputing and some early AI workloads.OperatorNext question is coming from Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research.Stacy Aaron RasgonFor my first one, Lisa, can you just like clarify this explicitly for me? So you said double-digit Data Center. Was that a full year statement? Or was that a second half year-over-year statement? Or was that a half-over-half statement for Data Center?Lisa SuYes. Let me be clear. That was a year-over-year statement. So double-digit Data Center growth for the full year of 2023 versus 2022.Stacy Aaron RasgonGot it. Which just given what you did in Q1 and sort of are implying for Q2 needs something like 50% year-over-year growth in the second half to get there. So you're endorsing those -- you're endorsing that now?Lisa SuI am...Jean X. HuYes, your math is right.Stacy Aaron RasgonThe math is right. Okay. For my second question, Jean, you made a comment on gross margins where you said the increase of gross margins in the second half was dependent on gross margin in Client getting better. I just want to make sure, did I hear that right?Jean X. HuYes.Stacy Aaron RasgonAnd why should I expect Client margins would get better, especially given what Intel has been doing in that space to protect everything? Like why is that something that's going to happen?Jean X. HuStacy Aaron RasgonGot it. And I apologize, I misspoke as well. 50% half of were half in Data Center, not year-over-year. So we're all doing it.OperatorOur next question is coming from Blayne Curtis from Barclays.Blayne Peter CurtisI had 2. Maybe just to start with following on Stacy's prior question. Could you just comment on what client ASPs did in the March quarter? I mean I assume they're down a decent amount. Your competitor was down, but any color you could provide on what the environment was in March?Lisa SuYes, sure, Blayne. So the ASPs were down quite a bit on a year-over-year basis, if you're talking about the overall Client business. And what that is, is that's also the Client ASPs were higher in the first half of '22, if you just think about what the supply environment was or the demand environment was in that. And given that we're undershipping in the first quarter, the ASPs are lower.Blayne Peter CurtisGot it. And then I just wanted to ask you on the Data Center business, the operating profit is down a ton sequentially. And you talked about enterprise being down, I think that's part of it. But it's a big drop, and it looks like gross margin probably is down a bunch, too. Can you just comment on why that drop in profitability in Data Center?Jean X. HuBlayne Peter CurtisBut I guess the big decline was sequential. So I'm assuming cloud was down sequentially?Jean X. HuYes. Sequential, it's revenue. If you look at the revenue, it was down very significantly, right? And the mix also is a little bit more indexed to cloud sequentially, too.Lisa SuYes. It's the same factors.Jean X. HuYes.Lisa SuSo both the mix to cloud as well as the R&D expense has increased just given the large opportunities that we have across the data center and especially AI.OperatorYour final question today is joined from Harsh Kumar from Piper Sandler.Harsh V. KumarLisa, I had a question. I wanted to ask you about your views on the inferencing market for generative AI 3+. Specifically, I wanted to ask because I think there's some cross currents going on. We're hearing that CPUs are the best way to do inferencing, but then we're hearing the timeliness of CPUs is not there as a function to be able to enable these kind of instances. So I was curious what you guys think. And then I had a follow-up.Lisa SuWell, I think, Harsh, if you were saying -- I mean, I think today, inference is used a lot. CPUs are used a lot for inference. Now where the demand is highest right now is for generative AI and large language model inferencing, you need GPUs to have the horsepower to train sort of the most sophisticated models. So I think those are the 2, as you say, crosscurrents. I think inference becomes a much more important workload just given the adoption rate of AI across the board. And I think we'll see that for smaller tasks on CPUs, but for the larger tasks on GPUs.Harsh V. KumarOkay. So it still defers back to GPUs for those. And then a similar question on the MI300 series. I know that you talked a lot about success in the HPC side. But specifically, I was curious if you could talk about any wins or any kind of successes or success stories you might have on the generative Ai side with the MI300 or 250 series?Lisa SuYes. So as we said earlier, we've done some really good work on MI250 with AI and large language models. The example that is public is what we've done with LUMI and the training of some of the Finnish models. We're doing quite a bit of work with large customers on MI300. And what we're seeing is very positive results. So we think MI300 is very competitive for generative AI, and we'll be talking more about sort of that customer and revenue evolution as we go over the next couple of quarters.Ruth CotterGreat.

AMD,AMD stock falls as PC industry slumps,"Yahoo Finance’s Daniel Howley joins the Live show to discuss the decline in stock for AMD as the PC industry slump hits chipmakers.Joining us now to discuss, Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley. The shares right now down 6%. And, Dan, it's so interesting because AMD had been gaining share on Intel, right, after lagging it for a long time. But it seems like in this environment, it's tough for everybody.For AMD in particular, they had a 64% year-over-year decline in client revenue. That's where they sell those PC chips, either to servers or to individual OEMs that then put them into the laptops that we purchase.So both companies, Intel and AMD, really suffering there. You know, Intel, for what it's worth, they kind of telegraphed this. I mean, so did AMD. But Intel, they've really been struggling as far as being able to kind of step up and compete, at least on a performance level. PC revenue for them fell 38% this past quarter when they reported that 36% drop in revenue.But, you know, AMD seemingly has them kind of on the ropes as far as the broader performance goes in the PC market. People are looking more towards AMD now. They've been doing that for some time.And, you know, Pat Gelsinger has this turnaround plan. They want to fabricate. They want to speed up the development of chips. How fast that works and how fast we start to see that impact is really dependent on whether or not he can get that plan to go through. And considering that, you know, we're seeing these steep revenue declines, it does make you wonder, will investors continue to put up with that?You look at, though, the likes of NVIDIA, meanwhile. They don't have to deal with the PC space as much. Yes, they're in the gaming space. Yes, that's a key component. But you would usually find in Nvidia chips in more higher-end computers. The Intels, the AMDs, they're across the board, you know, whether that's entry level, high end. So maybe it won't hit Nvidia as hard when they report later this month.But, really, this PC industry continues to struggle. No one needs a computer right now. And look, if you do, maybe you're putting off the purchase because you're trying to save a little bit of cash.They've been angling for AI for a while, right? They were doing this well before generative AI was something that we were even discussing, and so they kind of carry over that cachet.I will say that AMD does have its own AI capabilities. It's building that out. That's something that Lisa Su, the CEO at AMD, discussed. But I think as far as AI goes, you know, look at Meta. They were trying to work on their own chips. They went out and spent a boatload on NVIDIA chips, right? So I feel like every time Nvidia opens its mouth, they're discussing a new deal with another company where they're going to be using their products. So they still have a really, really solid lead there.","May 3, 2023 at 8:46 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/amd-stock-falls-pc-industry-134644923.html,Yahoo Finance Video,0.0,0.0,0.16686032401941492,0.5291554342122523

AMD,AMD's lackluster forecast sparks selloff in shares,"By Tiyashi Datta(Reuters) -Investors dumped shares of Advanced Micro Devices Inc on Wednesday after its earnings report indicated that it was struggling with a PC slump and had failed to gain market share from larger rival Intel Corp in the latest quarter.The stock fell nearly 9%, wiping out more than $12 billion from the company's market value. Intel, whose shares rose last week on a more upbeat PC market outlook, gained about 3%.""Even if Intel didn't gain share this quarter, it seems unlikely that they lost any either,"" Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said in a client note.""While we will see if Intel's 2024 roadmap holds water or not, the competitive environment next year is likely to get tougher for AMD.""The PC market has been in a slump for the past few quarters after a demand surge during the pandemic, while data center spending has also slowed as the economic outlook worsens.AMD, whose smaller and more efficient data center chips had helped it take market share from Intel last year, missed estimates for both PC and data center chip sales in the first quarter.Its sales forecast for the current quarter was also below market expectations, though the company was optimistic that the chip market would start to recover in the second half of 2023.""AMD results were more vulnerable (to the PC slump) than Intel's because most AMD-based PC customers were consumers. In contrast, Intel had a significant share in the business PC segment,"" Gartner analyst Mikako Kitagawa said.Still, some analysts said that the buzz around artificial intelligence and a recovery in China were positive signs that could help the company.""AMD is obviously not immune to the overall fluctuations of the macro spending environment, in our view, the share gains the company has earned through its roadmap execution and product performance will sustain through the choppy 1H23 before giving way to strong momentum in 2H23,"" brokerage TD Cowen said.(Reporting by Tiyashi Datta in Bengaluru; Editing by Anil D'Silva)","May 3, 2023 at 8:18 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amds-lackluster-forecast-sparks-selloff-131854531.html,Reuters,0.0,0.0,0.06768398268398267,0.41106060606060596

AMD,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q1 Earnings and Revenues Beat Estimates,"Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.60 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.56 per share. This compares to earnings of $1.13 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 7.14%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this chipmaker would post earnings of $0.66 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.69, delivering a surprise of 4.55%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Advanced Micro , which belongs to the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry, posted revenues of $5.35 billion for the quarter ended March 2023, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.91%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $5.89 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Advanced Micro shares have added about 38.5% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 8.6%.What's Next for Advanced Micro?While Advanced Micro has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Advanced Micro: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.61 on $5.47 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $2.98 on $23.41 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Electronics - Semiconductors is currently in the bottom 38% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Another stock from the same industry, Transphorm, Inc. (TGAN), has yet to report results for the quarter ended March 2023.This company is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.13 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -62.5%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.Transphorm, Inc.'s revenues are expected to be $4.6 million, down 6.7% from the year-ago quarter.Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

AMD,"AMD Q1 earnings: Beats on revenue and EPS, but chip sales drop 64%","Here are the most important numbers from the report compared to what Wall Street expected from the chip maker, as compiled by Bloomberg.Shares were down roughly 4% following the announcement.“We executed very well in the first quarter as we delivered better than expected revenue and earnings in a mixed demand environment,” AMD CEO Dr. Lisa Su said in a statement.“We launched multiple leadership products and made significant progress accelerating our AI roadmap and customer engagements in the quarter. Longer-term, we see significant growth opportunities as we successfully deliver our roadmaps, execute our strategic data center and embedded priorities and accelerate adoption of our AI portfolio.”CFO Jean Hu, meanwhile, said that the company is confident in second-half growth in both its Data Center and Client segments, which should offset ""modest declines"" in its Gaming and Embedded businesses.Second quarter revenue is expected to come in between $5 billion and $5.6 billion. Analysts called for $5.51 billion.The PC market is experiencing some of its worst performance in years, as consumers and businesses pull back on purchasing new computers amid increased interest rates.That said, the pain in the PC market also may have reached a bottom. According to Morgan Stanley Research equity analyst Erik Woodring, “pockets of demand are slowly emerging.”Woodring says that for the first time in six months, PCs built, which make up 75% of shipments, have been revised upward in two consecutive months.

AMD,AMD shares sink on forecast miss as PC market remains weak,"By Chavi Mehta, Jane Lanhee Lee and Stephen Nellis(Reuters) -Advanced Micro Devices shares slumped on Tuesday after the chipmaker forecast quarterly sales below estimates due to a weak PC market, overshadowing the company's optimism that the chip market would start to recover in the second half of 2023.The company also missed analyst estimates for PC and data center chips sales for the first quarter, and its shares fell over 6% in extended trading.That stood in contrast to rival Intel Corp, whose shares rose nearly 3% in extended trading. Intel last week said the PC market would start rebounding in the second half, raising Intel's margins with it.While analysts had watched AMD grab market share in the data center after Intel delayed ramping up the shipping of its most powerful data center processor chip code, named Sapphire Rapids, for over a year, some said they were seeing AMD now stall.""I think AMD's days of taking large swaths of share will likely be over, and it will probably see a more aggressive market for data center competing with Intel,"" said Anshel Sag, analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy. ""AMD has great products in data center, but Intel still has a lot of customers who are still using Intel and deep (customer) relationships.""Still, AMD CEO Lisa Su told investors on a conference call that the first quarter was the bottom of the market for the company's PC business and the industry.""We remain confident in our ability to grow in the second half of the year,"" she said.Part of that growth, Su said, will come from a chip called the MI300, which will compete with Nvidia Corp's flagship chips for artificial intelligence. Su said customer interest in the chip is growing.""We do believe that we will start ramping revenue in the fourth quarter with cloud AI customers, and then it'll be more meaningful in 2024,"" Su said. ""Success for us is having a significant part of the AI overall opportunity,"" she added.Nvidia has the bulk of the AI market, and analysts believe it has a strong hold on its position.""We believe MI300 will be used primarily on special projects or on a case-by-case basis,"" said Summit Insights Group analyst Kinngai Chan, adding that the MI300 is likely to be inferior to Nvidia's latest H100 data center chip for large language model applications, such as ChatGPT.AMD forecast current-quarter revenue of about $5.3 billion, plus or minus $300 million. Analysts polled by Refinitiv were expecting revenue of $5.48 billion.Revenue in the fiscal first quarter ended April 1 came in at $5.35 billion, compared with estimates of $5.30 billion.(Reporting by Chavi Mehta in Bengaluru, Stephen Nellis and Jane Lanhee Lee in San Francisco; Editing by Maju Samuel, David Gregorio and Leslie Adler)","May 2, 2023 at 3:24 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amd-forecasts-second-quarter-revenue-202409043.html,Reuters,-0.375,0.625,0.1289313399778516,0.4101605758582503
AMD,AMD Reports First Quarter 2023 Financial Results,"“We executed very well in the first quarter as we delivered better than expected revenue and earnings in a mixed demand environment,” said AMD Chair and CEO Dr. Lisa Su. “We launched multiple leadership products and made significant progress accelerating our AI roadmap and customer engagements in the quarter. Longer-term, we see significant growth opportunities as we successfully deliver our roadmaps, execute our strategic data center and embedded priorities and accelerate adoption of our AI portfolio.”“Our strategically important Data Center and Embedded segments contributed more than 50 percent of revenue in the first quarter,"" said AMD EVP, CFO and Treasurer Jean Hu. ""For the second quarter we expect sequential growth in our Data Center and Client segments offset by modest declines in our Gaming and Embedded segments.

AMD uses a normalized tax rate in its computation of the non-GAAP income tax provision to provide better consistency across the reporting periods. For fiscal 2023, AMD uses a projected non-GAAP tax rate of 13%, which excludes the tax impact of pre-tax non-GAAP adjustments, reflecting currently available information. AMD also provided adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow as supplemental non-GAAP measures of its performance. These items are defined in the footnotes to the selected corporate data tables provided at the end of this earnings press release. AMD is providing these financial measures because it believes this non-GAAP presentation makes it easier for investors to compare its operating results for current and historical periods and also because AMD believes it assists investors in comparing AMD’s performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that it does not believe are indicative of its core operating performance and for the other reasons described in the footnotes to the selected data tables. The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed in this earnings press release should be viewed in addition to and not as a substitute for or superior to AMD’s reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP and should be read only in conjunction with AMD’s Consolidated Financial Statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non GAAP financial measures referenced are reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in the data tables in this earnings press release. This earnings press release also contains forward-looking non-GAAP gross margin concerning AMD’s financial outlook, which is based on current expectations as of May 2, 2023 and assumptions and beliefs that involve numerous risks and uncertainties. Adjustments to arrive at the GAAP gross margin outlook typically include stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangible assets and acquisition-related costs. The timing and impact of such adjustments are dependent on future events that are typically uncertain or outside of AMD’s control, therefore, a reconciliation to equivalent GAAP measures is not practicable at this time. AMD undertakes no intent or obligation to publicly update or revise its outlook statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required by law.    ADVANCED

Adjusted EBITDA for the Company is determined by adjusting GAAP net income (loss) for interest expense, other income (expense), net, income tax provision, equity income in investee, stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization expense (including amortization of acquired intangible assets) and acquisition-related costs. The Company calculates and presents Adjusted EBITDA because management believes it is of importance to investors and lenders in relation to its overall capital structure and its ability to borrow additional funds. In addition, the Company presents Adjusted EBITDA because it believes this measure assists investors in comparing its performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that the Company does not believe are indicative of its core operating performance. The Company’s calculation of Adjusted EBITDA may or may not be consistent with the calculation of this measure by other companies in the same industry. Investors should not view Adjusted EBITDA as an alternative to the GAAP operating measure of income or GAAP liquidity measures of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities.

Free cash flow is determined by adjusting GAAP net cash provided by operating activities for capital expenditures, and free cash flow margin % is free cash flow expressed as a percentage of the Company’s net revenue. The Company calculates and communicates free cash flow in the financial earnings press release because management believes it is of importance to investors to understand the nature of these cash flows. The Company’s calculation of free cash flow may or may not be consistent with the calculation of this measure by other companies in the same industry. Investors should not view free cash flow as an alternative to GAAP liquidity measures of cash flows from operating activities. ","May 2, 2023 at 3:15 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amd-reports-first-quarter-2023-201500484.html,GlobeNewswire,0.125,0.16666666666666666,0.06691040052384595,0.34125195532758523
AMD,What's Happening With AMD Stock Today,"As per the analyst, the setup for the quarter is interesting, as the stock has appreciated 40% YTD into a significant adverse event, at least as far as the data center is concerned.The counterpoint is that AMD is pointing to relevant exposure to AI for the first time in the company's history around MI300, mainly due to the higher complexity of inference for large language models. He notes that anyone with AI exposure has rallied materially.The analyst expects AMD to deliver in-line earnings for 1Q23 with a downside risk on continued data center inventory adjustment on project push-outs.Street sentiment on the name remains positive, given anticipation of a PC bottom, exposure to cloud and share gains, and an emerging AI/GPU franchise.

AMD,"Job openings, Pfizer earnings, AMD reports: 3 things to watch","Investing.com -- Stocks gave up their gains, heading lower with minutes left in the trading session on Monday.Investors were cheered earlier by JPMorgan's (NYSE:JPM) deal to step in and buy the deposits and most of the assets of First Republic, capping a tense weekend as the market waited for regulators to announce a solution for the lender.Markets expect the Fed will raise rates another quarter of a percentage point, but where the Fed goes after that is still a trickier question to answer. Many believe the Fed will pause in June as it assesses the effect of its rate increases thus far, amid signs of a cooling economy. The bank turmoil in March, which spilled over to First Republic, is also expected to tighten lending, and that could toss additional cool water on the economy.Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:1.

AMD,"Calculating The Intrinsic Value Of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)","The projected fair value for Advanced Micro Devices is US$85.01 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to EquityCurrent share price of US$89.37 suggests Advanced Micro Devices is potentially trading close to its fair value View our latest analysis for Advanced Micro Devices We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$4.64bUS$6.03bUS$7.75bUS$9.76bUS$10.9bUS$11.8bUS$12.5bUS$13.1bUS$13.7bUS$14.1bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x10Analyst x8Analyst x5Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 7.87%Est @ 6.13%Est @ 4.91%Est @ 4.06%Est @ 3.46% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 9.6% US$4.2kUS$5.0kUS$5.9kUS$6.8kUS$6.9kUS$6.8kUS$6.6kUS$6.3kUS$6.0kUS$5.7kThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 9.6%.The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$137b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$89.4, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.We would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Advanced Micro Devices as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 9.6%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.267. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.StrengthDebt is not viewed as a risk.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Expensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.ThreatRevenue is forecast to grow slower than 20% per year.Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. For Advanced Micro Devices, we've compiled three further aspects you should assess:","April 30, 2023 at 6:00 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/calculating-intrinsic-value-advanced-micro-110016189.html,Simply Wall St.,0.4,0.6,0.13760964912280702,0.4826597744360903

AMD,UMC or AMD: Which Is the Better Value Stock Right Now?,"Investors interested in Electronics - Semiconductors stocks are likely familiar with United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.United Microelectronics Corporation and Advanced Micro Devices are sporting Zacks Ranks of #2 (Buy) and #3 (Hold), respectively, right now. This means that UMC's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.UMC currently has a forward P/E ratio of 10.08, while AMD has a forward P/E of 29.32. We also note that UMC has a PEG ratio of 4.18. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. AMD currently has a PEG ratio of 4.28.Another notable valuation metric for UMC is its P/B ratio of 1.76. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, AMD has a P/B of 2.58.These are just a few of the metrics contributing to UMC's Value grade of A and AMD's Value grade of D.UMC stands above AMD thanks to its solid earnings outlook, and based on these valuation figures, we also feel that UMC is the superior value option right now.United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC) : Free Stock Analysis ReportAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc.

PYPL,Time to Invest in the Growth of FinTech?,"Defined as new technology that seeks to improve and automate the delivery and use of financial services, the financial technology (fintech) market is forecasted to be valued at around $700 billion by 2030 with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 20%.PayPal’s RevolutionAs a brief synopsis, fintech companies strive to simplify and digitalize banking services, payment processing, peer-to-peer lending and payments, financial software, and other financial services.Despite giving back some of the gains since its 2015 IPO, PayPal stock is still up +94%. This has trailed the Nasdaq but is near the S&P 500’s performance and outperformed its former parent company eBay.PayPal has become one of the largest online payment solution providers and is responsible for making the process much easier for consumers during its early eBay days and the rise of the internet. Prior to this, the frequent use of mailed in checks to pay for purchased items on the internet became time insensitive, outdated, and incompatible with online purchases.Although there is increasing competition, PayPal’s growth story is far from over. Based on Zacks estimates PayPal’s earnings are forecasted to jump 18% in FY23 and climb another 16% in FY24 at $5.69 per share.More impressive, fiscal 2024 would represent a very stellar 132% growth in EPS since the pandemic with 2019 earnings at $2.45 per share. PayPal’s top-line expansion also supports its earnings potential with sales forecasted to rise 6% this year and jump another 9% in FY24 to $31.85 billion.Trading at $72 per share and 14.5X forward earnings, Wall Street's concerns of a high premium being paid for PayPal stock have faded. Better still, PayPal now offers a 45% discount to its industry average of 41.1X forward earnings and trades nicely beneath the S&P 500’s 18.8X.Quieting the premium fears in recent years, PayPal now trades 83% below its decade-long high of 87.8X and at a 67% discount to the median of 43.7X.PayPal’s ability to reconfirm its anticipated annual growth in its upcoming first quarter report on May 8 will be key for more upside in PYPL stock. With that being said, holding on to shares at current levels appears to be a keen way to get in on fintech expansion.Visa & Mastercard’s Transformation Newer start-up companies are often thought of in regards to fintech more so than these payment card giants but their impact on financial technology services shouldn’t be overlooked. This is especially true when considering Visa & Mastercard’s reliability to consumers and their very strong stock performances over the last decade.Furthermore, innovation and expansion in the fintech space is a way for Visa and Mastercard to continue their growth as larger mature companies.Specifically, Visa and Mastercard have to be recognized as their solutions in the digital wallet are as widely accepted for online shopping as their debit and credit cards are globally. Through Visa Checkout and MasterCard’s MasterPass, both companies have transformed themselves outside of plastic and evolved with the trend and digital age of consumer shopping.This should help preserve and expand their top and bottom line figures for years to come. Trading at $354 a share, Mastercard sales are forecasted to rise 13% this year to $25.16 billion with earnings expected to climb 15% at $12.26 per share. Fiscal 2024 sales and earnings are anticipated to jump another 12% and 17% respectively.   Pivoting to Visa which trades at $225 a share, earnings are expected to be up 14% in FY23 at $8.57 per share with sales rising 11% this year to $32.47 billion. Fiscal 2024 sales and earnings are projected to rise another 11% and 13% respectively.Block & Bitcoin  Block's Square Reader has been influential for smoother person-to-person transactions and has assisted small business owners in simplifying the payment process along with its larger Square Register.Outside of hardware products, Block's cash app has been innovative regarding money transfers with the company also implementing banking, lending, and bitcoin trading to its online platform.Trading at $60 a share and still up +370% since going public, Block’s performance has easily topped the broader indexes during this period. Block has intentionally stuck with solely providing Bitcoin services on its platform while other fintech companies such as PayPal include trading for a variety of cryptocurrencies.Block’s sole emphasis on Bitcoin is that it's still the most-traded cryptocurrency and the company’s concentration may provide larger returns rather than diversifying at the moment. To that point, along with providing bitcoin trading Block has entered the crypto mining space as a manufacturer of bitcoin chips.Notably, bitcoin prices have stabilized in recent months and Block may be a less expensive way to get concentrated exposure while also offering the diversification of its other financial services.Bitcoin derives about 50% of Block’s revenue with SQ stock landing a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at the moment. As Block continues its course of increased profitability more upside could be ahead with earnings projected to soar 63% in FY23 at $1.63 per share compared to EPS of $1.00 in 2022. Plus, fiscal 2024 EPS is forecasted to climb another 41%.  TakeawayThese companies are great illustrations of how the growth in financial technology services should intrigue investors. Considering the CAGR of the fintech market is +20%, there should be plenty of upside and growth for PayPal, Visa, Mastercard, and Block stock.  Mastercard Incorporated (MA) : Free Stock Analysis ReportVisa Inc.

PYPL,We Were Victims of Financial Scams: Here Are Our Stories,"According to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), consumers reported losing nearly $8.8 billion to fraud in 2022 — a staggering 30% increase over 2021.About 2.4 million people submitted fraud reports to the FTC last year, and two of the five most commonly reported scams involved online shopping and investment swindles.“I was once a victim of a forex trading scam that cost me thousands of dollars,” he said. “It all started when I received a direct message from a smooth-talking forex trader who promised me huge returns on my investment. We had met on Instagram, where he was running a trading company and would invest on behalf of his clients. He was so convincing that I decided to give it a shot and invested a significant amount of money into his trading platform.”At first, things seemed to be going well. Jason received regular updates on his profits, which were hefty enough to lull him into complacency.“I was thrilled with the returns I was seeing,” he said.Then, when he tried to withdraw those profits, it all came crashing down.“The trader suddenly became unresponsive and my emails and calls went unanswered,” Jason said. “It was then that I realized that I had been scammed.”Jason chose not to elaborate on how many thousands he lost, only that it was a “significant” amount of money.“And to make matters worse, I was unable to recover any of it,” he said. “I felt angry and helpless, and I couldn’t believe that I had fallen for such a scam. I had always been cautious with my money, but this experience taught me to be even more careful.”Jason lost enough in the fraud that he had to downsize his lifestyle in order to recover.“I had to cut back on my spending and learn to live with less,” he said. “It was a tough lesson, but it made me realize that I needed to be more careful with my finances. I also learned to research any investment opportunities thoroughly before making any decisions.”Overall, the experience was a painful one, but it taught him valuable lessons about financial responsibility and the importance of being cautious when it comes to investing.“I will always remember the pain of losing my hard-earned money,” he said, “but I will also use this experience to help me make better financial decisions in the future.”eBay scams are so common that the company’s security center has an entire page dedicated to helping shoppers stay safe and recognize the many clone sites, imposter emails and fake listings designed to steal their money.“I was so excited when I found a great deal on eBay for a brand-new laptop for just $700,” he said. “The seller had good reviews and was offering free shipping, so I jumped at the opportunity and used PayPal to complete the transaction.”However, as the days passed with no package, Chen started to get anxious.“My laptop still hadn’t arrived, and the seller wasn’t responding to any of my messages,” he said.It didn’t take long for Chen to realize he had fallen prey to a classic eBay fake-seller scam.“I had lost $700, and I was devastated,” he said. “I felt stupid for falling for such a scam, but I knew I had to take action. I immediately contacted PayPal to report the scam and provide them with evidence of the seller’s fraudulent behavior.”Chen turned out to be luckier than Jason. PayPal was able to reverse the transaction and get his money back.“It was a huge relief, but it also made me realize how important it is to be careful when shopping online,” Chen said. “Now, I always make sure to research sellers thoroughly before making any purchases. I also became more aware of the potential risks of shopping on eBay and other online marketplaces. I now make sure to double-check seller ratings and reviews, as well as ensure that the seller has a good track record of shipping products promptly and without issue.”Although PayPal made him whole, the experience was a tough pill to swallow.“I am grateful that I was able to recover my money, but I know that not everyone is as lucky,” Chen said. “It’s essential to take precautions and do your research to avoid falling victim to these types of scams.”More From GOBankingRates5 Expensive Renovations Homeowners Always RegretFinancial Insight in Your Inbox: Sign Up for GBR's Daily Newsletter3 Ways to Recession Proof Your Retirement7 Things You Must Do To Create a Plan for Your Money","May 3, 2023 at 6:00 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/were-victims-financial-scams-stories-130039704.html,GOBankingRates,0.0,0.0,0.10501770956316415,0.5409340659340658

PYPL,Looking for Stocks with Positive Earnings Momentum? Check Out These 2 Computer and Technology Names,"Earnings are arguably the most important single number on a company's quarterly financial report. Wall Street clearly dives into all of the other metrics and management's input, but the EPS figure helps cut through all the noise.The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report. The idea is relatively intuitive as a newer projection might be based on more complete information. The ESP is calculated by comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with the percentage difference between the two giving us the Zacks ESP figure.Paypal's Earnings ESP sits at 2.15%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $1.12 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.09.Slated to report earnings on July 27, 2023, Carrier Global holds a #3 (Hold) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $0.77 a share 85 days from its next quarterly update.For Carrier Global, the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.76 is 0.66%.PYPL and CARR's positive ESP metrics may signal that a positive earnings surprise for both stocks is on the horizon.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

PYPL,"Enfusion, Inc. (ENFN) Q1 Earnings Preview: What's in the Cards?","Wall Street expects flat earnings compared to the year-ago quarter on higher revenues when Enfusion, Inc. (ENFN) reports results for the quarter ended March 2023. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on May 9. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.03 per share in its upcoming report, which represents no change from the year-ago quarter.Revenues are expected to be $42.27 million, up 23.8% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 4% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Enfusion, Inc.For Enfusion, Inc.The Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -5.26%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #1.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Enfusion, Inc. Will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Enfusion, Inc. Would post earnings of $0.03 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.03, delivering no surprise.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Enfusion, Inc. Doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerPaypal (PYPL), another stock in the Zacks Internet - Software industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $1.09 for the quarter ended March 2023. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of +23.9%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $6.98 billion, up 7.7% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Paypal has been revised 0.1% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a higher Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 2.15%.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), suggests that Paypal will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.

PYPL,How Much Cash To Have Stashed at Home at All Times,"McCarty framed it more in terms of a ratio: “In terms of amount, don’t let your cash exceed 10% of your overall emergency fund and/or $10,000. You can’t deposit more than $10,000 in cash in a given year without raising red flags with the IRS.”“You don’t need to stash hundreds of thousands of dollars because that’s just over-preparing for a catastrophe that has a really low chance of taking place,” Capwell said.“It depends person to person, but an amount less than $1,000 is almost always preferred. There simply isn’t enough good reason to keep large amounts of liquid cash lying around the house. Banks are infinitely safer.”To drive home this point, he shared that neighbors of his parents wound up badly burned in a house fire because they were trying to find their hidden stockpiles of cash.“This is an extreme example, but the point stands,” Cramer said. “In today’s world of ubiquitous credit cards, Apple pay, Paypal, Venmo, etc., there aren’t enough good reasons to keep large amounts of cash in the house.”No matter how much cash you keep at home, you’ll want to keep it safe, said Matthew Dailly, managing director at Tiger Financial. “To begin with, you’ll need to locate safe havens for it…The loss of a large amount of cash can happen in a matter of seconds if your home is damaged by a flood or fire. Fireproof safe storage is, therefore, a good idea. In addition, you’ll serve as a lure for would-be burglars…Even if you purchase a high-tech safe, a criminal may still attempt to break into your home.”For security purposes, this money should be kept in a bolted down safe with any other valuables in the home, McCarty said. “Make sure the safe is fire and waterproof to avoid any damage. Make sure you deposit and replace the money on occasion so that the bills don’t get too old.”Jay Zigmont, PhD, CFP®, founder of Childfree Wealth, a life and financial planning firm based in Mississippi, offers another word of caution: “Having money on hand, of course comes with the threat of theft or loss, but also, it may be a challenge for you to not spend it. I’ve heard of people freezing the money–literally–to slow them down, giving their spouse or child the key to the safe or other things to slow themselves down. Figure out a balance that works for you.”When things get bad, people have a tendency to panic, and taking out a lot of cash to protect against emergencies can actually work against you. Contrary to popular belief, you are already protected from a bank failure, Dailly said.If a bank goes under, the standard FDIC insurance is $250,000 per depositor, per insured bank, for each account. “To avoid a total collapse of the entire financial system at once, you can simply divide your fortune among several banks.”A good rule of thumb is to keep as little as you think is necessary; while it might seem weird, cash actually loses value over time. “Unlike money in circulation, which loses value over time, money in a bank retains its worth and, on occasion, even climbs in value. A safe financial institution is the only way to ensure the safety of your money,” Dailly said.More From GOBankingRates10 Aldi Brand Products Worth BuyingLearn To Master Your Money With These Financial Tips3 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000Financial Insight in Your Inbox: Sign Up for GBR's Daily Newsletter","May 2, 2023 at 7:00 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/much-cash-keep-home-times-180337690.html,GOBankingRates,0.2,0.2,0.08713369963369959,0.40850427350427365

Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Paypal appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAnother stock from the Zacks Internet - Software industry, Fortinet (FTNT), is soon expected to post earnings of $0.28 per share for the quarter ended March 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +47.4%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $1.2 billion, up 25.7% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Fortinet has been revised 0.9% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.01%.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Fortinet will beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.PayPal Holdings, Inc.

Though domestic equities provide ample opportunity, it is also worth focusing on emerging markets as well. Firstly, investors may find benefits to tracking emerging markets because they are earlier in their growth trajectory.In other words, even though the companies may be smaller in size, their growth potential is often higher. Secondly, emerging markets provide investors with a means of diversification. If your entire portfolio is too concentrated in one market, an adverse price move in the wrong direction could devastate your portfolio.Investing in ETFs is the most straightforward way to participate in Latin America’s economic development. ETFs are useful for investors because they eliminate single stock risk, are highly liquid, and save investors time researching individual companies.Another way to find opportunities in LATAM is to look for companies that are mirroring the success already achieved by similar companies in the United States.Unlike the U.S. market, which is saturated with digital payment companies, Brazil’s market is largely untapped. As Brazil’s economy develops, more and more of its citizens will begin using digital payments. Though most payments are still conducted in cash, the shift is starting into the digital world, and it is showing up in STNE’s earnings and earnings estimate picture.Last quarter, EPS swung to a profit of $0.14 per share versus a loss the year before. Meanwhile, revenue jumped a healthy 52%. In the past 60 days, the Consensus Estimate Trend has been revised higher more than once for the next quarter and the full year.The Zacks Internet – Software Industry that STNE is in has been outperforming the market and is ranked in the top 27% of all groups tracked.STNE checks all the boxes. First, since the company is international, it aids investors in gaining portfolio diversification. Secondly, the stock is showing strong relative strength. Over the past month, STNE is up by 30%, drastically outperforming the 3% gain in the S&P 500 Index.From a technical perspective, the stock is trying to break over a key zone which it has failed at several times in the past. However, the recent relative strength coupled with the strong expectations going forward gives me confidence that this break-out will stick. If the stock can get and stay above the $12.50-$13 zone there is a ton of room to run.See Stocks Free >>Media ContactZacks Investment Research800-767-3771 ext. 9339support@zacks.comhttps://www.zacks.comPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

PYPL,New Venmo feature lets users transfer crypto to outside walletsand to each other,"Venmo soon will allow users to transfer their Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash to outside wallets—as well as to other users of the popular payment app.Crypto transfers on Venmo will be irreversible, just like crypto transactions more broadly—a function of cryptocurrency’s use of blockchains, or immutable public ledgers. To roll out the transfer system, PayPal is partnering with Paxos, a crypto firm that specializes in stablecoins.“We’re excited to connect Venmo’s customers to the community, other wallets and exchanges, and we intend to continue to roll out additional crypto products and services in the year ahead,” PayPal said in its statement.Before the onset of Crypto Winter and the recent regulatory crackdown on the industry, PayPal was one of the more public crypto boosters among legacy fintech firms.In October 2020, the company announced that U.S. users of PayPal would be able to buy, hold, and sell Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin. One year later, the payments giant expanded the feature to Venmo customers.","April 28, 2023 at 11:00 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/venmo-feature-lets-users-transfer-160000402.html,Fortune,0.0037878787878787845,0.29318181818181815,0.14464285714285713,0.4184523809523809
PYPL,Apple Pay Later won't affect us for years: Klarna CEO,"Where Siemiatkowski is worried about competition is startups, not tech giants. “It's the startups and the new people coming with new, great ideas moving at super slight speed. Those are the ones you should be worried about as a company,” he said.Key video moments:00:00:09 On Paypal00:00:27 On Apple Pay Later00:02:18 On startupsI don't know. Like, I just-- I think-- I don't want to be arrogant to big companies' abilities to be competitive, but they're also-- if you look at Buy Now, Pay Later, with Apple right now and Apple Pay Later, it's actually-- while, obviously, I love Apple Pay-- in store, it works amazingly well. But if you look at the top 100 US retailers, more people offer Klarna now, those in the US, than offer Apple Pay.I'm not talking about Apple Pay Later. In order to use Apple Pay Later, you Also have to sign up for it. It only works on Safari. It doesn't work in Chrome. It only works on an iPhone. It doesn't work on your desktop. I mean, there's so many limitations that it will take years before this product has any potential significant impact on what we're doing.And to us, Buy Now, Pay Later, is just a feature. I think the strongest and most fantastic thing about Klarna is on every transaction we process, we carry SKU level data. When you shop with us at Macy's, we can show you not only that you bought for $100, exactly images of the items that you bought and the sizes, and the colors.And in this AI-powered world that we're going, this data and the fact that consumers are sharing this data with us is creating fantastic opportunities to match consumers to new brands, to new businesses and providing them an even better way to save money, save time, make them less worried about their finances. So it's like, I think that the-- that's really the key thing that media misses on Klarna is SKU level data.There's no other network out there-- Visa, Mastercard, none of them has this network on the rails, and that's creating for us unique opportunity. Buy Now, Pay Later, is a fantastic feature. It's grown a lot of interest. But for me, Klarna is so much more than that. And if Apple Pay Later becomes the buy-now, pay-later offer, sure, fine. But that doesn't solve that Apple doesn't have access to SKU level.","April 27, 2023 at 4:56 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/apple-pay-later-wont-affect-215601009.html,Yahoo Finance Video,0.0,0.0,0.20947227375798805,0.5042924998282141
PYPL,11 Best Gig Economy Stocks To Invest In,"Gig economy seems to be one of the most anti-fragile industries since it experiences growth even during the most difficult times. The online freelancing market saw a huge boost during the pandemic, when millions of workers were either laid off or were forced to work from home. These workers found new possibilities of making money using freelancing platforms like Upwork and Fiverr. The next downturn came in 2022 amid rising inflation and the Federal Reserve’s policy of increasing interest rates. As inflation started to bite people’s paychecks and eat into savings, millions of people sought to find side hustles for extra income.“We find that, upon probing, roughly one in 10 workers who initially reports working for an employer on one or more jobs (and thus is coded as an employee) is in fact an independent contractor on at least one of those jobs. Incorporating these miscoded workers into estimates of work arrangement on the main job nearly doubles the share who are independent contractors, to about 15 percent of all workers. Young workers, less-educated workers, workers of color, multiple-job holders, and those with low hours are more likely to be miscoded. Taking these workers into account substantively changes the demographic profile of the independent contractor workforce. Our research indicates that probing in household surveys to clarify a worker’s employment arrangement and identify all low-hours work is critical for accurately measuring independent contractor work.”The rise of online freelancing platforms like Upwork Inc. (UPWK) and Fiverr International Ltd (NYSE:FVRR) has allowed millions of people to find gigs to supplement their income. Many are finding full-time jobs on these platforms as well. Upwork Inc. (UPWK) published a study back in December 2022 which shows the stunning impact of these freelancing platforms on the overall economy and also the importance of gig economy. Upwork Inc. (UPWK) said that its study of US workforce showed that a whopping 60 million Americans performed freelance work in the past 12 months. This is 39% of the entire US workforce.American freelancers contributed an astounding $1.35 trillion in annual earnings to the U.S. economy, $50 billion more than in 2021.Impact of Gig Economy on Labor Market“Public perception is that people take on multiple jobs when the economy is bad because they’re not earning enough in their job. People take on additional jobs when there are additional jobs to be had.”For this article we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 943 hedge funds and picked 11 companies operating in the gig economy space. Most of these companies are operating platforms that allow people to buy and sell services online. Some of these companies play a key role in the gig economy and benefit from the activity taking place in the industry.

PYPL,Factors to Note Ahead of Paycom's (PAYC) Q1 Earnings Release,"The company projects revenues between $443 million and $445 million for the first quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $444.2 million, indicating an increase of 25.7% year over year. The consensus mark for earnings is pegged at $2.34 per share, suggesting a 23.2% rise from the prior-year quarter.Paycom estimates adjusted EBITDA in the range of $210-$212 million in the quarter to be reported. The company’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 11.6%.Paycom Software, Inc. Price and EPS SurprisePaycom Software, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Paycom Software, Inc. QuotePaycom’s first-quarter performance is likely to have benefited from strong demand for latest products, new business wins and the high-margin recurring revenue business. The company’s employee usage strategy, sales efforts and investments might have contributed to sales growth in the quarter to be reported.The cloud-based human capital management solution provider earlier announced its intention to aggressively drive advertising and marketing efforts to generate more demo leads, virtual meetings and increased close rates of deals. This is likely to have led to market share gains for Paycom.The company expects strong adoption of BETI solution, an industry-first technology that empowers employees to do their payroll among clients, aiding them to avoid time-consuming manual checks. We anticipate new client additions to have driven the top line in the first quarter.However, Paycom’s quarterly performance is expected to have been affected by macroeconomic uncertainty-triggered economic and business disruptions, which might have hurt the headcount across its client base. Enterprises are postponing their large IT spending plans due to the weakening global economy amid ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical issues.Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Paycom this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. However, that’s not the case here.PAYC has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #3 at present.

PYPL,Will Paypal (PYPL) Beat Estimates Again in Its Next Earnings Report?,"Have you been searching for a stock that might be well-positioned to maintain its earnings-beat streak in its upcoming report? It is worth considering Paypal (PYPL), which belongs to the Zacks Internet - Software industry.This technology platform and digital payments company has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 8.51%.For the last reported quarter, Paypal came out with earnings of $1.24 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.20 per share, representing a surprise of 3.33%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $0.95 per share and it actually produced earnings of $1.08 per share, delivering a surprise of 13.68%.Price and EPS SurpriseFor Paypal, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Paypal currently has an Earnings ESP of +2.15%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on May 8, 2023.When the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

(PYPL) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It","Over the past month, shares of this technology platform and digital payments company have returned -1.3%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +2.6% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Software industry, which Paypal falls in, has lost 1.9%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Paypal is expected to post earnings of $1.09 per share, indicating a change of +23.9% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.3% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.90 points to a change of +18.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.4%.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.69 indicates a change of +16% from what Paypal is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.6%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Paypal.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Paypal, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $6.98 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +7.6%. For the current and next fiscal years, $29.2 billion and $31.82 billion estimates indicate +6.1% and +9% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPaypal reported revenues of $7.38 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +6.7%. EPS of $1.24 for the same period compares with $1.11 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.4 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.24%. The EPS surprise was +3.33%.Over the last four quarters, Paypal surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Paypal is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Paypal. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.PayPal Holdings, Inc.

PYPL,Can a CBDC be truly private? An ACLU technology expert weighs in,"Crypto is filled with contentious acronyms. The newest front has emerged around CBDCs, or central bank digital currencies—a kind of government-backed alternative to cryptocurrencies, such as the Bahamian Sand Dollar or the Nigerian eNaira. Digital payments are here to stay, whether offered through services like Venmo and PayPal, decentralized blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum, or government-backed projects like CBDCs, and the only question is which future wins out.The American Civil Liberties Union has also emerged as a critic. I spoke with Jay Stanley, a senior policy analyst focused on speech, privacy, and technology, who explained that CBDCs could serve as a public good with digital payments surging in popularity, although achieving that balance will be nearly impossible to pull off.As crypto advocates have long argued, cash is the only truly private means of payment. Its physical nature means anyone can access it and transact with it, with the only limits being availability and volume. Bitcoin emerged as a digital alternative, but governments and private firms have devised methods to track even privacy-focused cryptocurrencies like Zcash and Monero.As Stanley told me, a well-executed CBDC should mimic the properties of physical cash, meaning it would be fully accessible and untraceable. He acknowledged the government’s interest in tracking larger transactions to prevent money laundering, but he said the KYC requirements for CBDCs should only kick in at higher thresholds, as they do with cash—an arguably outdated $10,000 limit set in the 1970s.“When you're talking about ordinary people and ordinary transactions, we don't think that the tentacles of the government's surveillance infrastructure should reach down to that level,” he said.If that sounds like a pipe dream, you're right. Even so, with the country barreling toward a future that disincentivizes cash in favor of digital transactions controlled by corporations, Stanley argues that we should at least be pushing the government in the right direction—a more practical view than those held by Emmer and DeSantis, who want to ban CBDCs altogether. As he put it, there is a war on cash by credit card companies and other financial firms, but we should proactively make sure that cash equivalents remain an option.What an ideal CBDC would look like is unclear, especially for people without bank accounts. Stanley said it could entail a combination of cryptographic techniques like zero-knowledge proofs that mask transaction data, as well as ledger-based systems held by the Treasury Department or the Federal Reserve.“This is something that could be a real value for our economy and society if it were done right,” Stanley said.What do you think? If you’re at Consensus this week, come let me know.","April 26, 2023 at 7:59 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cbdc-truly-private-aclu-technology-125923390.html,Fortune,0.0,0.375,0.07011183261183261,0.458423520923521

This is expected to be May 8, 2023. The company is expected to report EPS of $1.09, up 23.86% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $6.97 billion, up 7.53% from the prior-year quarter.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $4.90 per share and revenue of $29.2 billion, which would represent changes of +18.64% and +6.12%, respectively, from the prior year.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Paypal. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends.

We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon.

PYPL,3 Must-Buy Fintech Growth Stocks After the Fed Bailouts,"That said, the turmoil in the banking sector has caused many fintech names to trade at depressed prices despite solid balance sheets and high growth potential as they tap into new markets and segments that the incumbents underserve.Moreover, I believe that investing in fintech growth stocks is not as risky as some investors think. The Fed has shown that it is committed to preventing a banking crisis and has ample tools and resources to do so. Even if some fintech names are connected to these banks, they will also be the ones to be rescued.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsWith that in mind, let’s look at three fintech growth stocks:Source: shutterstock.com/rafapressFurthermore, the demand for personal loans continues to grow.

Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Calix: mixed.

PYPL,15 Best Financial Stocks To Buy Now,"Belski noted that there are over 4000 banks in the U.S. and roughly 600 of them are publicly traded, so ""just because two were bad apples, doesn't make the whole tree bad"". Belski noted that investors' confidence has been shook in the aftermath of the collapse of SVB, and so investors have positioned themselves in broader market ETFs. He argued that this is the market for owning individual stocks as these names will outperform as fundamentals, interest rates, and valuations return to normal levels.Brian Belski expects large banks to outperform small and medium-sized banks over the next 3 to 5 years due to large banks having strong balance sheets, strong book values, and strong return on equity. Moreover, Belski expects increased consolidation within small and medium-sized banks. Finally, Belski thinks that small and mid-sized banks may face more strict and targeted regulatory measures because of the recent management issues that led to the collapses of SVB.""I think people have forgotten that the stock market is a discounting function. The market is already down 26%. Whether or not we get a recession is almost a moot point. I think people's obsession with the recession is controlling their outlook too much. And their fear, I think that's why you have to be kind of evenly distributed within sectors. Make big bets in the sectors that you wanna own. Tighten up your positions, don't own a lot of stocks, own less stocks, and I think that's how you're gonna outperform in the second half of the year.""Our MethodologyTo determine the best financial stocks to buy now, we sifted through Insider Monkey's database of roughly 900 elite hedge funds and identified the most popular financial stocks among institutional investors.

(NASDAQ:FISV) to $150 from $140 and maintained an Overweight rating on the shares.Fiserv, Inc. (NASDAQ:FISV) is one of the best financial stocks to buy now according to hedge funds. As of April 14, the stock has returned 18.71% to investors over the past 6 months.Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 70On February 23, Block, Inc.

(NASDAQ:PYPL), and Visa Inc. (NYSE:V).Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 71On April 13, The Progressive Corporation (NYSE:PGR) released earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2023. The company's EPS for the quarter was $0.66. The Progressive Corporation (NYSE:PGR) generated a revenue of $16.11 billion, up 22.22% year over year and ahead of market consensus by $97 million.The Progressive Corporation (NYSE:PGR) is one of the best financial stocks to buy now.

As of April 14, the stock has gained 10.94% and is trading at a TTM PE multiple of 16x.On April 4, Oppenheimer revised its price target on American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) to $180 from $182 and maintained an Outperform rating on the shares.

The stock is placed tenth on our list of the best financial stocks to buy now according to hedge funds.The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) is trading at an attractive PE multiple and is also offering dividends. As of April 14, the stock is trading at a PE ratio of 14x and is offering a forward dividend yield of 1.97%.My view changed when it became clear that liquidity would become a greater issue for all banks in early March. We believe Schwab has enough liquidity to operate its business, but we no longer believe the company is in a position to return capital. Furthermore, Schwab saw a higher degree of deposit flight in Q4 than we expected leading us to believe the problem could get worse before it gets better. Schwab may even need to raise additional equity capital to reassure the market of its liquidity position which would drastically change the risk/reward calculation of investing in the stock. While we realized a ~6% loss on our investment, our ability to quickly recalibrate our views during the early stages of the March banking crisis prevented us from losing an additional 20%+ if we had held on until today.”Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 81On April 14, Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) announced earnings for FQ1 2023. The company reported an EPS of $2.19 and outperformed EPS expectations by $0.50.

On April 14, Goldman Sachs analyst Richard Ramsden raised his price target on Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) to $49 from $46 and maintained a Buy rating on the shares. The stock is one of the best financial stocks to buy now.As to gradual improvement, new management has made steady headway in closing consent orders, settling regulatory matters and upgrading systems. Thus, rather than increasing profits from growth, Wells Fargo’s earnings growth for the next three-to-five years should come from the combined tailwinds of rising interest income, partially offset by normalizing credit costs, reduced expenses as systems improve and the scandals of the last decade are gradually put behind them, and the return of excess capital through share repurchases and rising dividends. The hypothetical earnings bridge displayed in Figure 6 gives some sense of the earnings power we see unfolding in the years ahead for this durable financial franchise.While our grounded optimism carries the day, we are mindful of the risk that Wells Fargo’s historically excellent credit culture may have deteriorated, or that exasperated regulators may choose to extract even more major penalties for past infractions.”Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 97Shares of S&P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) have appreciated by 16.97% over the past 6 months, as of April 14, and the stock is offering a forward dividend yield of 1.03%. S&P Global Inc.

PYPL,Freelancers can prepare now for new 2023 tax reporting,"Right now, freelancers and small business owners need only report payments totaling $20,000 or any number of payments above a threshold of 200 with the forms. Beginning next year, that threshold will be just $600, and every income transaction will need to be reported.Some in the space say the new law will benefit both freelancers and the IRS by improving information gathering, especially for people who are self-employed and those who sell on sites like Etsy and Ebay.Right now, freelancers and small merchants already owe taxes on that income via third-party platforms, but it can be difficult to keep track of every payment, especially across sites and apps. This can lead to confusion and underpayment.The coming change will affect platforms, businesses, and individuals, and it’s good to begin preparing now.Here's what you need to know:WHAT SHOULD I DO TO GET READY FOR THE NEW 1099-K REPORTING THRESHOLD?If you're already keeping accurate track of your income from freelancing as paid via Venmo, Zelle, Cash App, PayPal, and other sites, you're in good shape. The main difference will be that these platforms will issue you additional forms for every transaction, rather than transactions beginning at a threshold of either 200 payments or $20,000. This should make correct reporting to the IRS even easier.Currently, if someone paying a freelancer via Venmo, Zelle, or CashApp sends a form to the IRS reporting that pay, but the (taxpaying) freelancer doesn’t report the income with the same form, that creates a “matching error” for the agency. This change will better ensure taxpayers receive proper refunds and the IRS receives proper payment.WHAT IF I MISTAKENLY RECEIVE A 1099-K FORM?In some cases, in part due to the changing guidance, platforms may send taxpayers 1099-K Forms in error — such as for transactions between family and friends or expense sharing, according to the IRS.The first thing to do is try to get an updated form by contacting the company that issued the form incorrectly. If you can't get one in a timely manner, the IRS says to zero out the income on your tax return with the description “Form 1099-K Received in Error.""WHY DID THE IRS DELAY IMPLEMENTING THE CHANGE?The change, which had been set to take effect this year, was delayed in December. The IRS decided to give taxpayers another year to adjust to the new reporting requirements to “help smooth the transition and ensure clarity,” according to acting commissioner Doug O'Donnell.“The additional time will help reduce confusion during the upcoming 2023 tax filing season and provide more time for taxpayers to prepare and understand the new reporting requirements,"" he said in a statement.WHAT ADVICE AND GUIDANCE DOES THE IRS HAVE FOR FREELANCERS?WHAT IF I MAKE A MISTAKE REPORTING INCOME ON 1099-K FORMS?The IRS will be in touch if they see discrepancies between income reported on 1099-K forms by taxpayers and companies issuing the forms, both this year and next. It's important to keep in mind that income from all platforms, including things like YouTube ads and Patreon subscriptions, must be reported in this way. One way to make sure all income is accurately captured is to be sure to transfer all payments from your PayPal, Venmo, and Cash App accounts to a traditional bank account, rather than keeping it on third-party platforms.___You can see all of AP’s Financial Wellness content at https://apnews.com/hub/financial-wellness.___The Associated Press receives support from Charles Schwab Foundation for educational and explanatory reporting to improve financial literacy.

PYPL,Yishan Wongs résumé: From mopping floors at Burger King and a hell boss at PayPal to running Redditheres how he became the CEO he is today,"The dot-com bubble was bursting and a generation of tech workers were being spat out from the up-and-coming industry as collateral damage.In fact, it was the only decent offer he had.I mopped the dining room, cleaned the bathroom and took down orders… At the time, Burger King still had a pretty manual old-style 80s register that didn’t calculate the change for you. I became extraordinarily fast at doing calculations. My supervisor was always impressed that at the end of the shift, my drawer never had errors in it.I learned that wherever you are, just try to do a really good job and you’ll stand out.I learned a lot from this job because my boss had around 40 years of experience on me. He got his PhD in computer science before I was even born.The top piece of advice I've always remembered from him is that anytime you have a range of options, imagine them on a line graph. Never pick the option in the middle, always pick one of the two extremes because then you get extreme benefits.I used this way of thinking in 2020 when I decided to make my current company 100% remote.Now that people are going back into offices, our whole company is never going to able to be in one office. But we get the extreme benefit of being able to source talent from anywhere in the world.Some people have these hell bosses, right? It wasn't that kind of experience. He was just incompetent and ineffective, and because most of my bosses prior had been so good he stood out.My advice in that situation is that you can't let it bother you because it'll just eat you up. You’ve just got to do your thing. But it really reinforced how valuable good leadership is.I joined Facebook because out of all the companies I interviewed at, it had an atmosphere similar to early PayPal.I actually asked to be interviewed by Mark Zuckerberg because I wanted to figure out what kind of founder he was going to be. At the time the company had around 20 workers so that was still possible—and very interesting.Zuckerberg didn't care at all about business or money, and he really didn’t sell out to VCs. All he cared about was that we make a really good product for the users.He once said to me, there are all these things that you think that you need to be. But leadership is not something that you have to find, it’s inside of you.It was weird because this guy was younger than me. He still couldn’t drink. But until that point, I did think “I need to like gain these skills, or learn these things, or be older” a lot.To some point that’s true, yet many of the personal qualities that you need to be a leader come from inside of you.When I left Facebook, the startup economy was just starting to bounce back from the 2008 crash.A friend of mine and I needed a place to like work on our independent projects, but back then co-working spaces didn't exist.The landlord wanted us to sign a 10-year lease, but we only wanted a one-year lease because we had raised all the money up-front. Each year as demand increased, so did rent.We could have kept raising money to match the rent, but it seemed like too much money to ask of our backers for the same service. So we shut the business down.However, if we had just signed the 10-year lease at $2 a square foot, we could have sublet the office space entirely when rent skyrocketed to $15 a square foot. So Sunfire could have been WeWork, but maybe we dodged a bullet...While at Square I gave out a piece of advice to engineering managers which has apparently now been repeated all over Silicon Valley which is ‘hope is not a strategy’.Strategy is where you say, the following three things can happen, these are the possible outcomes and I have a strategy for all of them, that will get me to where I want to go.Saying ‘we're gonna do this, and then hope this happens’—as the engineers did that day—is not a strategy.”If you read the history of ‘Reddit under Yishan’ it says that the user base increased fivefold, and that we were able to cut costs and get technical costs down to avoid bankruptcy.So it sounds like a success. But I felt like it had been a failure. Getting burned out and quitting felt like a setback.Before I left, I raised a bunch of money for the company, and that fundraising was so depleting that I didn't have as much in me to continue.I was only around 34 years old and didn't know how much being a CEO involves management of your own energy and psychology.For a while after, I would second-guess myself, like, ""what if I had made this decision differently?"" Until I realized: whoa if I made this decision differently, I would still be there—and I don't actually want to still be there.If that hadn't happened, other things (like founding Terraformation) wouldn't have happened and my successors have done a very good job of running Reddit.So regrets are genuinely not useful and control is an illusion—make the best of whatever situation you're in.I have found that people who don't like to be told what to do, don't like to tell other people what to do. As it turns out, I'm one of those people and that can cause a problem as a leader because sometimes people need to be told what to do.I learned that too late to correct a bunch of errors that I'd made while at Reddit. But it's one of the things that I've stayed conscious of in this position.Workers don't want to be micromanaged, but you have got to be willing to give them some direction.If you just say the goal is x a very small number of people can take that and then formulate an entire strategy.Usually, people need to hear the goal is x and the way we're going to achieve it, is by doing a, b, and c.I still err a little bit too much on the side of not setting those expectations enough. But I try to be conscious of knowing when people need specific guidance and direction.","April 17, 2023 at 7:00 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/yishan-wong-r-sum-mopping-120046228.html,Fortune,0.0,0.0,0.133609623015873,0.44600198412698433

PYPL,"PayPal Holdings, Inc. (PYPL) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know","Over the past month, shares of this technology platform and digital payments company have returned +1.6%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +7.7% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Software industry, which Paypal falls in, has gained 11.8%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Paypal is expected to post earnings of $1.09 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +23.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.The consensus earnings estimate of $4.90 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +18.6%. This estimate has changed +0.3% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.68 indicates a change of +15.9% from what Paypal is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.8%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Paypal.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Paypal, the consensus sales estimate of $6.97 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +7.5%. The $29.2 billion and $31.81 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +6.1% and +8.9%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPaypal reported revenues of $7.38 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +6.7%. EPS of $1.24 for the same period compares with $1.11 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.4 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.24%. The EPS surprise was +3.33%.Over the last four quarters, Paypal surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Paypal is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Paypal. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.PayPal Holdings, Inc.

We’re still well off the all-time highs in most stocks, but at the same time, the market has enjoyed a tremendous rally over the last three to six months. That’s got investors wondering what the best bargain stocks are at this point.At the same time, no one wants to get suckered into buying into the market right near an medium-term top.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsDespite the big rally in the first quarter, there are still plenty of stocks trading at bargain levels.

PYPL,The 7 Most Undervalued Stocks to Buy in April 2023,"That’s an especially good question as it seems unlikely that the current market volatility has ended. The war in Ukraine drags on, the regional banking system is under fire, inflation is too high and the Federal Reserve continues to hike interest rates.All this makes it imperative that investors buy the most undervalued stocks to ensure a margin of safety in this unsettled economy.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThere are, of course, a lot of different metrics folks can use to identify the most undervalued stocks. For the sake of this article, I’ll be picking seven of the best companies from Morningstar’s 5-star stock category, as these come from the small list of companies that their analysts believe are trading at dramatic discounts to fair value.CCitigroup$45.90AVTAvnet$44.06BRBroadridge Financial Solutions$143.35PYPLPayPal$75.37GPNGlobal Payments$103.81SABRSabre $7.20VZVerizon Communications$39.36Source: Syda Productions / Shutterstock.comThat said, at some price, a firm’s issues are reflected in the valuation, and Citigroup is at that point.The valuation has also gotten silly. Shares are going for just half of book value. The stock is also selling for just seven times forward earnings. This sets Citigroup up to both repurchase stock and pay a 4.4% dividend yield. Morningstar believes C stock is worth $75, making it among the most undervalued stocks out there.Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comBut, given the current glut in the semiconductor market, traders have refused to give Avnet the valuation multiple it deserves, which is what puts it among the most undervalued stocks.In fact, astonishingly enough, AVT stock is selling at just six times forward earnings. Sure, the semiconductor cycle is currently on the downswing. But, distributors take much less risk than the actual manufacturers or chip designers. Avnet has proven to be robust in past semiconductor cycles.Source: Hermin / Shutterstock.comThis is an ideal sort of business. It provides an integral service to brokerages, investment banks and other end clients. And its fees are low enough to not be a meaningful part of its customers’ bottom line. And, with minimal competition, Broadridge has been able to maintain fat profit margins.Broadridge shares have traded flat since 2020 while earnings growth continues to hum along. As a result, shares are now going for just 21 times forward earnings. Morningstar believes shares are worth $185, versus a current price of $145. Given Broadridge’s tremendous earnings growth track record, investors are likely to bid the company back up to a more generous valuation in due time.However, the early surge in transaction volumes seen in 2020 and 2021 quickly faded. Along with that, the tech industry went into a tailspin. PYPL stock plunged from a high of $300 to just $76 today.That seems like an overreaction. Unlike many tech peers, PayPal is profitable. Shares are going for just 16 times forward earnings today. I’d also note that the company is continuing to grow revenues at nearly 10% a year, and analysts expect earnings growth of at least 10% annually going forward.PayPal’s core business, while slower, is still showing steady growth. The stock price, however, would suggest that things were far worse than they actually are. To that point, Morningstar believes PYPL stock is worth $135 per share which offers tremendous upside from today’s price.Source: JHVEPhoto / ShutterstockThe payments industry has plummeted since 2021 thanks to firms like PayPal coming up short of investors’ lofty expectations. GPN stock has lost more than half its value since its peak two years ago.The thing is, Global Payments hasn’t had its operations impaired. In fact, earnings are continuing to grow at a double-digit clip, even as the stock price has plummeted. GPN stock now trades at just 10 times forward earnings. Morningstar’s Brett Horn believes shares are fully 41% undervalued today.Source: Maridav/ShutterStock.comSabre, and its two competitors, get a cut of every transaction that passes through these GDS ticketing platforms. As airline traffic has come roaring back over the past two years, it has given the GDS firms a tailwind.That said, Sabre has failed to capitalize so far. It invested heavily in upgrades to its tech infrastructure just prior to the pandemic. Business came to a halt before these upgrades could pay off; instead, Sabre ended up undercapitalised and in financial trouble.The company has struggled to get back on track and reach profitability. However, there’s a high-quality business lying under the surface here. Morningstar believes Sabre can take flight once again; its analyst pegs fair value at $10.50 versus today’s price in the low $4 range.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comIt’s rare that telecom companies end up being dramatically mis-priced. But Morningstar believes that is exactly the situation with Verizon today. Analyst Michael Hodel pegs fair value at $57 per share versus a current price of $39. The massive discount available today probably won’t last long, and in the meantime, shares offer a 6.7% dividend yield.Ian Bezek has written more than 1,000 articles for InvestorPlace.com and Seeking Alpha.

INTC,Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) is a favorite amongst institutional investors who own 62%,"Given the large stake in the stock by institutions, Intel's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisionsThe top 25 shareholders own 39% of the company Recent purchases by insiders Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Intel. See our latest analysis for Intel Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.Intel already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Intel's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.Institutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Intel. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 8.8% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 8.0% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 4.3% by the third-largest shareholder.Our studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.The definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing.

Unlike the net income of $786 million, or 56 cents per share that AMD earned during last year’s comparable quarter, this time it made a net loss of $139 million, or 9 cents per share. The adjusted EPS amounted to 60 cents per share, topping the expected 56 cents.The group where sales from PC processors belong to marked the biggest decline as revenue dropped nearly 65% YoY to $739 million, significantly below the expected $908 billion, according to Bloomberg.The Data Center unit generated $1.29 billion in revenue, also below the expected $1.46 billion.AMD CEO Lisa Su noted that growth is expected in the second half of the year as the PC and server markets recover.

INTC,Investors Heavily Search Intel Corporation (INTC): Here is What You Need to Know,"Over the past month, shares of this world's largest chipmaker have returned -7.9%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.5% change. During this period, the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry, which Intel falls in, has lost 0.9%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Intel is expected to post a loss of $0.03 per share, indicating a change of -110.3% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -889.3% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $0.56 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -69.6%. This estimate has changed +0.3% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $1.78 indicates a change of +218.2% from what Intel is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -2.1%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Intel is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Intel, the consensus sales estimate of $12.02 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -21.5%. The $51.21 billion and $58.6 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -18.8% and +14.4%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryIntel reported revenues of $11.72 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -36.2%. EPS of -$0.04 for the same period compares with $0.87 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $11.05 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +5.98%. The EPS surprise was +75%.Over the last four quarters, Intel surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Intel is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Intel. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Intel Corporation (INTC) : Free Stock Analysis ReportTo read this article on Zacks.com click here.Zacks Investment Research","May 2, 2023 at 8:00 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-intel-corporation-130001679.html,Zacks,-0.2,0.5,0.09586734693877552,0.44812925170068013

INTC,Does Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) Have A Healthy Balance Sheet?,"Debt is a tool to help businesses grow, but if a business is incapable of paying off its lenders, then it exists at their mercy. If things get really bad, the lenders can take control of the business. However, a more common (but still painful) scenario is that it has to raise new equity capital at a low price, thus permanently diluting shareholders. Of course, plenty of companies use debt to fund growth, without any negative consequences. When we think about a company's use of debt, we first look at cash and debt together. View our latest analysis for Intel As you can see below, at the end of April 2023, Intel had US$50.3b of debt, up from US$37.2b a year ago. Click the image for more detail. However, because it has a cash reserve of US$27.5b, its net debt is less, at about US$22.7b.According to the last reported balance sheet, Intel had liabilities of US$27.4b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$57.5b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting this, it had US$27.5b in cash and US$4.09b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$53.3b.In the last year Intel had a loss before interest and tax, and actually shrunk its revenue by 27%, to US$56b. That makes us nervous, to say the least.","May 2, 2023 at 6:00 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/does-intel-nasdaq-intc-healthy-110025220.html,Simply Wall St.,0.5,0.5,-0.050279106858054215,0.383133971291866

That would put the total back above the level in 2022, when shipments began sliding.Gelsinger is confronting a massive pileup of inventory, weak demand and the loss of market share — all of which contributed to a historic slump. At the same time, he’s trying to speed up the introduction of new production technology, a costly attempt to regain Intel’s industry leadership. But that effort — if successful — won’t bear fruit until 2025.Investors have been skeptical that the chipmaker can catch up with rivals, and the stock plunged nearly 50% last year. In the wake of Intel’s latest results, Gelsinger argued that the company has begun to turn a corner.“We saw a turning point where there is a stronger product line,” he said in an interview with Bloomberg Television on Friday. “We believe the inventory corrections will be completed.”Read More: Intel’s ‘Worst Is Over’ Scenario Faces Earnings TestIn the near term, Intel’s financial outlook still looks dim. It expects a loss of 4 cents a share in the second quarter, excluding some items. That compares with the 2-cent average estimate of analysts.That initially sent shares down more than 2% in late trading, before a later rally. They had closed at $29.86, leaving them up 13% this year.The revenue outlook was a bit brighter, with the company predicting sales of $11.5 billion to $12.5 billion. The midpoint of that range exceeds the average analyst estimate of $11.7 billion.Intel predicted that gross margin — the portion of sales remaining after deducting the cost of production — would be 37.5% in the second quarter. That compares with an estimate of 41%.“In the things that they can control, they’ve lived through the worst of that pain,” said Cody Acree, an analyst for Benchmark Co.The company has been running its factories at less than their full capacity, meaning it has to take “underloading” charges that crimp margins. While that headwind will recede as the company is able to increase output later this year, margins won’t rebound to where they once were until those plants are upgraded, according to Chief Financial Officer Dave Zinsner.The factories need new manufacturing technologies that will be expensive to put in place. Once that happens — and Intel is competitive with rivals again — the company hopes to restore profitability to historical levels.When its factories were home to the industry’s most cutting-edge production and its products were dominant in the server and PC markets, the company regularly posted a margin of more than 60%.Intel also aims to get funding from the federal Chips and Science Act, which passed last year. That legislation will pump billions of dollars into domestic chip manufacturing and research. Intel expects to get access to that money as soon as this year, Gelsinger said Friday on Bloomberg TV.In the first quarter, Intel reported a loss of 4 cents a share, excluding some items, better than the 16-cent loss analysts had predicted. Revenue came in at $11.7 billion. That beat analysts’ projection of $11.1 billion, but sales has come down sharply in recent years. Intel had quarterly revenue of more than $20 billion as recently as 2021.Client computing, Intel’s PC chip business, generated $5.8 billion in revenue. That compares with an estimate of $4.95 billion. Data-center sales were $3.7 billion, versus an average projection of $3.51 billion.First-quarter PC shipments slumped 29% to 56.9 million units, taking them back below the levels of early 2019, according to IDC. That puts the industry on course to come in more than 100 million units shy of its 2021 total.Intel’s strength in the server processor market once cushioned it from the ebb and flow of the PC business. Server chips, the central components of machines that run the internet and corporate networks, are much more expensive and profitable than those that go into laptops. But in that area, Intel has lost market share to rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and in-house efforts by major customers such as Amazon.com Inc.’s AWS.A slowdown in demand in the server and networking business hasn’t hit bottom yet, Intel executives said Thursday.Overall, Intel gave enough positive news to raise investors’ spirits. But analysts like Benchmark’s Acree will be waiting for the company to follow through.“There are still a lot of questions,” he said.--With assistance from Ed Ludlow, Guy Johnson and Kailey Leinz.(Updates with Bloomberg TV interview starting in seventh paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekWhy Launch Rockets When You Can Just Fling Them Into Space?Even $500 Million a Year From Google Isn’t Enough to Save FirefoxAirbus Bets on a Stretched A220 Jet to Beat Boeing’s 737Data Science Is the Hot New Master’s at B-SchoolsHow a Dishwasher Engineer Challenged Elon Musk’s Grip on Commercial Space©2023 Bloomberg L.P.","April 28, 2023 at 11:19 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intel-predicts-bigger-loss-expected-204055553.html,Bloomberg,-0.2,0.3,0.011467698967698966,0.36631872401103166

He said, “All of the steps of our turnaround are underway. Good execution on the product side, good execution on the process, technology momentum that we have and I think investors are looking at.”Generative AIWhen asked about Intel’s integration of AI, Gelsinger added, “We're driving a software environment that enables everyone in the world. Generative AI becomes mainstream with democratization of AI and that's where Intel comes in.”Video highlights:00:00:30 - Intel Q1 earnings00:01:30 - Inventory corrections00:03:40 - New products00:05:10 - Generative AI00:08:00 - Outlook for Intel[MUSIC PLAYING]Pat, always nice to get some time through here. So a little different story today in terms of the stock market reaction compared to the previous few quarters. Shares of Intel up here almost 6%. What do you think investors are taking away from the quarter?Good execution of the product side. Good execution on the process technology. Momentum that we have. And I think investors are looking at it and seeing a bit of the green shoots, as we've described, that's starting to emerge in the Intel turnaround story.So in the PC marketplace, we're actually pretty optimistic that we've bounced off the bottom and now are starting to see a good trajectory. And the data center and cloud market, hey, it was a tough quarter. But even there, we did better than people expected. And we think we were able to hold market share. And I call that a turning point to the data center market one where we've been fighting for a while. And we had to fight through some poor product execution.Our next-generation Gen 4 Xeon, the Sapphire Rapids product ramping very well hitting a million units. And all four of the next-generation products, the second half of this year. Key new products for next year on our next-generation process technology. Intel 3 looking very healthy. The market is seeing us deliver those before they expected.So all of that is reinforcing product execution as well as process execution. And that combination is saying, wow, these guys are really starting to lean in tough market. But they're starting to stabilize. And as I said, the first moment that I see these glimmers of hope in the data center business. Tough inventory in the networking markets and edge. But even there, we're starting to see that, hey, we're have a good handle on this. We don't think we lost any market share. It's just overall tough market conditions.And obviously globally, we're starting to see China start to emerge a bit more. And a second half in the tech industry is definitely stronger, and then the first half and most year. So all of those put together, we're a bit optimistic that Q1, improvement in Q2, and improvement through the second half of the year.On a leadership process technology, like Intel 3, the combination of a stronger server product on a stronger process technology gave everybody in the marketplace a bit of more-- bit more confidence than I think people expected. And with that, we're obviously be building that in the US. A key process technology for US manufacturing but also for our foundry business as well.Well, I think that combination of getting back to leadership and the data center with leadership process technology, everybody has looked at that and says, wow, they're starting to get their execution mojo back. And I think that was one of the things that I was most proud of. My team in the first quarter really executing product process and financial discipline.And I sort of think about that Sozzi-like weather simulations. Only a few have machines big enough to build them. But then many need to use them. And that's what we call learning versus inference. And inference is one where we say everybody wants to be able to take advantage of those large language models, but using them, not creating them. And that's really where the second layer of this comes in.And we're starting to compete for the large language models. We have new component called Gaudi2, right, which is setting performance records for those largest training environments. But Intel is much more about democratizing AI. And that's where products like our Xeon Gen 4 Sapphire Rapids' strong performance on AI helping customers to inference. And we see inferencing to become the dominant AI workload, an area of more natural strength.But then we also say the third piece is we need to enable the entire software ecosystem across every platform that we deliver. And our next-generation client, for instance, has a lot of AI capabilities because you'll be able to do things on the client generating your text, being able to do eye movement into your Zoom, being able to do real-time language translation in your team's call.But also then at the edge, right, where you'll be using, inferencing for in-store analytics or for security in the data centers of our enterprise customers where they want to be able to take those big models but use it locally with their data without eliminating any of their restrictions around security and data privacy. And finally, helping for those super, ultra-large language model creation. So we're driving a software environment that enables everyone in the world. Generative AI becomes mainstream with democratization of AI. And that's where Intel comes in.Oh, the product, oh, a little bit better than we thought. They're getting their mojo back. And then, of course, the big investments around our process technology leading to the foundry business. A whole new area that is so aligned with the Western interests of a balance-resilient supply chain.Our margins, we laid out a picture for that improving as we go through the year, as we go through the reserves and the front end of the year as we start building back and having a fully loaded factories, improving the margin structure of the company for the long term. Clearly, we've laid out a multi-year path for that to accomplish. We've got a lot of work to do. But Q1 meet, beat, and raise was a great foundation to build on for the rest of the year.[MUSIC PLAYING]","April 28, 2023 at 10:42 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/pc-slump-did-better-people-154235211.html,Yahoo Finance Video,0.2,0.45,0.14162140270630835,0.40582271502082823

INTC,"Intel Q1 earnings: This was a horrible quarter, analyst says","Bernstein Research Managing Director and Senior Analyst Stacy Rasgon joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss Intel earnings, slowing PC demand, the risk of a recession, and the outlook for Intel.[AUDIO LOGO]In other words, things are pretty bad for Intel. So even some kind of little marginal improvement is seen as good news by the market. Is there going to actually-- do you think that improvement is going to materialize?However, they set the bar much lower than that. And expectations have been rock bottom. And that's sometimes, that's all it takes. I mean, the big question people are trying to answer on Intel is is it as bad as it can get? And from what we heard last night, the answer to that plausibly could be yes. It could be as bad as it could get.They are looking for a bit of a recovery in the back half. They used the word ""modest,"" although there is enough there to maybe believe that it could be better than modest. They've got people excited now about gross margins getting back to 40%, which, again, is an unbelievable kind of statement. You never would have thought they'd be this low in the first place.But we're at the point now where I think you can plausibly make the case that we'll see how long it takes for things to get better. I don't know. But hopefully things can't get worse from here. And that's why the stock is up today. Even in the midst of a horrible quarter, expectations were even lower. Sometimes that's all it takes.Revenues collapsing. They did beat expectations, by the way, because they set the expectations so low. But, I mean, revenues were down a ton. They were down I think both their PC and their data center businesses were down almost 40% year-over-year.Gross margins are now well into the 30s. Free cash flow, they burned $9 billion in free cash flow in the quarter. I mean, it was pretty horrendous.Q2 is going to be bad, but it won't be quite that bad. And they're looking for things to get better in the back half. So yes. And beyond that, call me in a few years. We'll see.So now PCs have corrected. And their shipments have gone from overshipping now to undershipping. And they think in Q1, they actually undershipped the market by 20%.So that doesn't last forever. And so even if PCs didn't grow, at some point, you go from undershipping by 20% to shipping in line. That's actually a pretty material lift, half over half, right, if that normalization happens. And it should happen at some point.In data center, again, it's been very weak. Enterprise in China have been weak for quite a while. They've probably hit bottom. Those may start to get better. They've got new products that are launching in the back half with higher prices. They talked about little green shoots in China maybe. So, again, plausibly you can argue that can get better.What would be the risk to this? Clearly there's a demand and a macro statement. Yeah, if we hit a hard landing and they're looking for PCs for the year to come in around 270 million units, I'm closer to 250. But fine. What if they were 220 because macro was horrible? That would be a risk. That's not strictly an Intel risk. That would be like in everybody risk.And some of what we're seeing in terms of the low revenue is because they are flushing out inventory from the channel. They are undershipping and demand. That should get better once the channel inventory is normalized. So that's something that they're doing, which is OK.But I'd say on the client side, on the PC side, their roadmap looks pretty good. And on the data center side, the products have been delayed, but those products are finally ramping. They have new products that are coming next year.They had a data center event a few weeks ago, where they talked about that being on track. Maybe those will slip. I don't know. I don't have a ton of confidence. But if they do slip, they don't have to tell us about it for almost a year. So at least for the next probably four quarters, everything's going to look like it's on track.In terms of the broader strategy, so, look, they're investing a ton of money. They're trying to build a third-party foundry business and everything else. It's painful. Now, you could argue it's the right strategy in the sense that if Intel wants to have a robust and viable company 5 years, 10 years down the line that is competitive with the best in the world, they're probably doing the right thing. They have to invest heavily to do that.Their mistake was setting expectations so high. I don't know why Pat came in and just sounded so bullish. He should have come in and said, look, we think we're on the right path, but you guys have to be patient. It's going to be a slog. And they didn't really do that.But if that's the goal, that's the right strategy because their alternative is to lay down and die, right? Turn it into IBM. We're not going to invest. We're just going to manufacture earnings and just manage a business in decline.That is a model. You can run a company like that. That's not what Pat came in to do. And that's not what the strategy is.So in 5 years or 10 years, maybe this is the right strategy. But the problem is we won't know if it's going to work for five years. That's the biggest problem with owning the stock structurally here. Even if it's off the bottom-- we upgraded it a few weeks ago on exactly this thesis, that probably it can't get any worse.But doesn't mean I want to own it because the problem is I have no idea what the company looks like in five years. It's impossible to know at this point. And given that uncertainty and the fact that even if what they're doing is the right thing, the chances of success are not guaranteed. I think it's a hard thing to own structurally.","April 28, 2023 at 10:00 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/intel-q1-earnings-horrible-quarter-150051725.html,Yahoo Finance Video,-1.0,1.0,0.020217721432007153,0.4670642822785681

INTC,Apple and Microsoft Have Never Held More Sway Over the S&P 500,"(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. and Microsoft Corp. have never held more sway over the S&P 500 Index, leaving some investors on edge over the gauge’s increasingly top-heavy nature.Most Read from BloombergFDIC Asks Banks for Final First Republic Bids Due SundayHarley-Davidson Says Repo Shortage Is Fueling Credit LossesTwitter Co-Founder Dorsey Rues Musk Deal: ‘It All Went South’First Republic’s Fate Uncertain After Stock’s Harrowing DropA Century-Old Dynasty Overhauls Its Billions in Rare M&A BetThe world’s two most-valuable companies saw their combined weightings in the benchmark jump to a record 14% this week after strong earnings reports from Microsoft and others fueled a rally in technology stocks. When you include Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Meta Platforms Inc. and Nvidia Corp, nearly a quarter of every dollar put into the S&P 500 is now split between just six names.“It’s concerning to have such concentration in a few names and all those companies are in the very similar tech and communication services sectors,” said Michael Landsberg, chief investment officer at Landsberg Bennett Private Wealth Management. “This concentration will drive broader market performance until it doesn’t.”According to Tejas Dessai, an analyst at Global X ETFs, the growing influence of big tech in major indexes puts passive investors at risk of over exposure. “However, it does help that these businesses are some of the most innovative names in the technology world and none are looking at a secular decline anytime soon,” he said.Apple and Microsoft alone have added more than $1 trillion in combined market value in 2023, nearly half of the gains for the entire S&P 500.The world’s biggest technology and internet firms have long dominated the benchmark index, but their statures were diminished in 2022 when soaring interest rates and slowing growth sent valuations tumbling. While the stocks remain well below peak levels, their outperformance this year relative to the market capitalization-weighted index is fueling their rising influence.The tech giants have benefited from a flight to the perceived safety of their cash-rich balance sheets amid bank turmoil. And they found a new source of momentum this week when Microsoft reported profit and sales that beat Wall Street estimates.

Their action followed Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger's remarks the PC market - on which Intel built its reputation - was stabilizing after multiple quarters of decline.""While the future pace of the sector's recovery is uncertain, we do believe that Intel has reached a revenue, gross margin, and profit trough through this first half of 2023,"" said Benchmark analyst Cody Acree, upgrading the stock to ""buy"".Intel on Thursday projected adjusted gross margins will climb above 40% in the second half, and said it had ramped up shipments of a key data center chip after a more than one-year-long delay had allowed rivals to take its market share.TD Cowen analysts said the company ""was not out of the woods yet but this was a starting point.""Intel's market capitalization is set to rise by nearly $11 billion to more than $130 billion, if gains hold.

INTC,Jack Dorsey's Block Snaps Up Bitcoin Mining Chip as Intel Winds Down Production,"Jack Dorsey's fintech-payments company Block (SQ) recently bought a large number of bitcoin (BTC) mining chips from Intel (INTC), which will accelerate its plans to enter the mining hardware market just as the chipmaker winds down production.Block recently jumped on the opportunity to buy a large quantity of these ASICs from Intel, it said in a Friday blog post. The firm was planning on finalizing its design of a 5-nanometer chip for bitcoin mining this quarter and build machines based on that. The purchase means that the team can focus exclusively on the 3-nanometer design, the post said.Nanometers in chip design refer to the size of each transistor, millions of which are packed together make up a chip. The smaller the transistors, the more that can fit on a chip so it can run more calculations, making for a more powerful chip.Block's first-party products will come early next year, said Thomas Templeton, Block's hardware lead, in an interview with CoinDesk. Asked about the quantity of chips the company bought, he said it is enough to bridge the time until Block can design and productize its own 3-nanometer chips.Block said it aims to improve the decentralization of the Bitcoin network. When it comes to mining, ""the main problem"" is ""the diversity of manufacturing and supply chain,"" said Templeton. ""We want to make more more tools for more people to build and use. When you dig into mining, the ASIC is at the center of mining.""The mining manufacturing industry is dominated by two players: Bitmain and MicroBT.","April 28, 2023 at 7:30 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jack-dorseys-block-snaps-bitcoin-123000790.html,CoinDesk,-0.15555555555555559,0.2888888888888889,0.21617535903250187,0.4371126228269085

INTC,"Intel (INTC) Reports Q1 Loss, Tops Revenue Estimates","Intel (INTC) came out with a quarterly loss of $0.04 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $0.16. This compares to earnings of $0.87 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 75%.

This compares to year-ago revenues of $18.35 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Intel shares have added about 9.9% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 5.6%.What's Next for Intel?While Intel has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Intel: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock.

INTC,"UPDATE 4-Intel results mixed, sees slump ending in 2nd half of 2023","(Updates share move and headline, adds analyst comments)By Chavi Mehta and Jane Lanhee LeeApril 27 (Reuters) - Chipmaker Intel Corp on Thursday estimated second-quarter earnings below Wall Street forecasts despite its greater sales optimism, a sign that the company is still struggling to make money despite early signs of a recovery in global chip demand.Intel shares rose 2% in extended trading, having gained more than 10% so far this year after a tough 2022. While profits and margins were lower than analysts had expected, Intel executives said a slump in PC demand could start to ease in the second half of the year and that the company aims to resume making profits.A fall of about 30% in first-quarter global PC shipments has made some chip industry experts hopeful that an inventory build-up has cleared out, paving the way for fresh orders.Intel has also ramped up shipping of its most powerful data center chip Sapphire Rapids, which had been delayed for over a year.The company forecast a second-quarter revenue range with a midpoint of $12 billion, above analysts' consensus estimate of $11.75 billion, Refinitiv data showed.Intel Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger said in an interview he was ""seeing some green shoots, increasing stability in the PC market as inventories have stabilized,"" adding that he expected the company to hold its position in the data center business.Intel has also ramped up shipments of its most powerful data center chip, Sapphire Rapids, whose more than one-year delay had allowed rival Advanced Micro Devices and ARM-based server CPU makers to take market share from the company.""The numbers do suggest Intel has gotten about as bad as it will get, so the next quarters depend heavily on corporate tech purchases,"" said Glenn O'Donnell, research director at Forrester.""We believe tech spending will slowly increase, which is decent news for Intel and other chipmakers. It all comes down to any kind of macroeconomic recovery.""Intel, struggling to make money, predicted second-quarter adjusted losses of 4 cents per share, worse than the 1 cent per share profit that analysts had estimated according to Refinitiv data.Underscoring Intel's profitability slump in recent years, its first-quarter gross margin fell to 34.2%, almost half of its multi-decade high of over 67 in 2010. The company forecast a further drop to 33.2% for the second quarter.""Intel's gross margin continues to suffer from competitive pricing, fab underutilization and new product start-up cost,"" said Kinngai Chan, analyst at Summit Insights Group. ""The lower gross margin outlook is a disappointment, but it takes time to correct the mistakes of the past.""Gelsigner said he discussed Intel's $5.4 billion effort to acquire Tower Semiconductor with Chinese government officials on a recent visit. Intel is still waiting on regulatory approval in China to close the deal.""It was a topic of discussion for many meetings that I had there,"" Gelsinger said. ""We don't have a clear view of when that might occur, but we continue to work hard to reach approval of the acquisition.""Intel has a commanding market share for PC and server processing chips and the company has planned to spend billions of dollars to build out new manufacturing hubs and improve product design and performance.Revenue from its data center and AI group fell 39% to $3.7 billion. Client computing group revenue, which includes PCs, dropped 38% to $5.8 billion.Intel's aggressive push has come at a cost.The company in February slashed its dividend to a 16-year low, saving cash for investments to catch up with the likes of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd on manufacturing technology and to help grow its business of making chips for outside customers.First-quarter revenue of $11.72 billion slightly exceeded estimates of $11.04 billion. Intel said adjusted losses were 4 cents per share, above analysts' expectations of a 15 cent per share adjusted loss.

INTC,"Intel profit forecast misses estimates, shares slip","By Chavi Mehta, Stephen Nellis and Jane Lanhee Lee(Reuters) -Chipmaker Intel Corp on Thursday said slumping gross margins will improve in the second half of the year, a welcome sign in a difficult economy that sent shares up 4% in after-hours trading.Intel also said it was shipping a long-delayed chip in volume, and Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger told Reuters he saw signs of stability in the market for PCs, on which Intel built its reputation.Gelsinger said he was ""seeing some green shoots, increasing stability in the PC market as inventories have stabilized,"" and he expected the company to hold its position in the data center business.During a conference call with investors, the company projected that adjusted gross margins will climb above 40% in the second half, having hit historic lows in the first half of the year. That was enough to overcome concerns about current profitability. A fall of about 30% in first-quarter global PC shipments has made some chip industry experts hopeful that an inventory build-up has cleared out, paving the way for fresh orders.""The numbers do suggest Intel has gotten about as bad as it will get, so the next quarters depend heavily on corporate tech purchases,"" said Glenn O'Donnell, research director at Forrester. ""We believe tech spending will slowly increase.""Intel has also ramped up shipping of its most powerful data center chip, codenamed Sapphire Rapids, which had been delayed for over a year. That delay had allowed rival Advanced Micro Devices and ARM-based server CPU makers such as Ampere Computing to take market share from the company.The company forecast a second-quarter revenue range with a midpoint of $12 billion, above analysts' consensus estimate of $11.75 billion, Refinitiv data showed.Intel, struggling to make money, predicted second-quarter adjusted losses of 4 cents per share, worse than the 1 cent per share profit that analysts had estimated according to Refinitiv data.Underscoring Intel's profitability slump in recent years, its first-quarter unadjusted gross margin fell to 34.2%, almost half of its multi-decade high of over 67% in 2010. The company forecast a further drop to an unadjusted gross margin of 33.2% for the second quarter.""While we understand investors may be disappointed in its 2Q23 gross margin outlook, we are confident that Intel's gross margin will recover in 2H23 as the burden of factory underutilization and new product start-up cost diminishes,"" said Kinngai Chan, analyst at Summit Insights Group.CHINA MEETINGSGelsinger said he discussed Intel's $5.4 billion effort to acquire Tower Semiconductor with Chinese government officials on a recent visit to Beijing. Intel is still waiting on regulatory approval in China to close the deal.""It was a topic of discussion for many meetings that I had there,"" Gelsinger said. ""We don't have a clear view of when that might occur, but we continue to work hard to reach approval of the acquisition.""He added that the China market, one of the biggest for Intel, felt like it was picking up momentum and that there was ""strong support and enthusiasm"" from customers. While geo-political risks remain, he said ""the business community is a bridge between U.S. and China that we think is a positive one"".Since China lifted its COVID pandemic measures, U.S. CEOs of big tech companies have been visiting the country.First-quarter revenue of $11.72 billion slightly exceeded estimates of $11.04 billion. Intel said adjusted losses were 4 cents per share, above analysts' expectations of a 15 cent per share adjusted loss.(Reporting by Chavi Mehta in Bengaluru; Jane Lanhee Lee and Noel Randewhich in Oakland, Californin; and Stephen Nellis in San Luis Obispo County, California; Editing by Richard Chang and Stephen Coates)","April 27, 2023 at 3:10 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intel-forecasts-second-quarter-revenue-201012188.html,Reuters,0.0,0.0,0.006384032634032638,0.31375000000000003

INTC,Silicon Wars: Inside the battle for market share in the chip space,"Yahoo Finance’s Daniel Howley joins the Live show to discuss the battle for market share in the chip space amid declining chip demand.The street currently expecting a 15% share loss. Let's get to Yahoo Finances Tech Editor Dan Howley for more on this battle for market share. Dan, what are you watching?And that stockpile now is not being used because people are cutting back on buying. And that includes consumers, as well as commercial buyers. So that's where the memory issues are coming from. Samsung then has little reason or little ability to sell them at price. So they're having to either cut price or, as they said in their announcement, scale back on production until they start to see inventory levels start to even out.Now, on Intel's side of things, they're going to report after the bell today. And we are expecting another decline there from the company. Revenue expectations are for $11.1 billion. That would be down from $18.4 billion-- excuse me-- in Q1 of 2022. We're expecting an adjusted loss per share of $0.15. That's down from an adjusted increase of $0.87 a share.The big deals here are the client computing and data center and AI divisions. Client computing, that's basically where the chips were made that go into things like PCs. That is expected to come in at $49 billion compared to 9.-- sorry-- 4.9 billion-- excuse me-- versus 9.3 billion in Q1 2022. And then on the data center side of things, it's expected to be $3.5 billion versus $6 billion in 2022.So I think the broader question here is we're all talking about AI NVIDIA. I mean, share prices for them are absolutely through the roof. They've rocketed since January 84%. And so why aren't we seeing the same thing out of Intel? Well, because Intel's exposure to AI isn't nearly as large as NVIDIA. NVIDIA basically hit a gold mine here.They have graphics chips. Graphics chips are great at processing multiple streams of data. And so they're perfect for AI capabilities. That's whether putting together the types of algorithms that are used in AI or putting them into use. So they are great for that. That's why we're seeing companies go and buy up tons of Intel, as well as AMD.Don't forget, they have their graphics line of products. And they're able to do the exact same thing. Intel, they make CPUs mostly. And so CPUs, they're just not built right for AI computation. And so, as a result, we're seeing fewer companies look towards Intel for AI. In fact, if you look at what we had seen from reports about Meta from a Reuters report, they had said that Meta was struggling with their AI side because they were using CPUs rather than GPUs.Now, whether or not they were using Intel or NVIDIA's, besides the point, that's just to illustrate that CPUs are not built for this kind of function. So now that we're seeing more people pile into that, I don't think that we're going to get the kind of boost out of Intel that we may from NVIDIA or AMD because of that wave of AI.","April 27, 2023 at 10:41 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/silicon-wars-inside-battle-market-154134904.html,Yahoo Finance Video,0.0,0.0,0.12250721500721501,0.43013038548752835

INTC,Are Intel Corporation's (NASDAQ:INTC) Mixed Financials The Reason For Its Gloomy Performance on The Stock Market?,"Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. Check out our latest analysis for Intel ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Intel is:7.8% = US$8.0b ÷ US$103b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.08.Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.When you first look at it, Intel's ROE doesn't look that attractive. A quick further study shows that the company's ROE doesn't compare favorably to the industry average of 19% either. Accordingly, Intel's low net income growth of 2.9% over the past five years can possibly be explained by the low ROE amongst other factors.As a next step, we compared Intel's net income growth with the industry and were disappointed to see that the company's growth is lower than the industry average growth of 27% in the same period.Despite having a normal three-year median payout ratio of 27% (or a retention ratio of 73% over the past three years, Intel has seen very little growth in earnings as we saw above. Therefore, there might be some other reasons to explain the lack in that respect. For example, the business could be in decline.In addition, Intel has been paying dividends over a period of at least ten years suggesting that keeping up dividend payments is way more important to the management even if it comes at the cost of business growth. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company is expected to rise to 35% over the next three years. Still, forecasts suggest that Intel's future ROE will rise to 9.4% even though the the company's payout ratio is expected to rise. We presume that there could some other characteristics of the business that could be driving the anticipated growth in the company's ROE.","April 27, 2023 at 8:00 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intel-corporations-nasdaq-intc-mixed-130012560.html,Simply Wall St.,0.0,0.25,0.029991319444444452,0.4036458333333333

INTC,"ASML, Europes Most Valuable Tech Firm, Is at the Heart of the US-China Chip War","(Bloomberg) -- In 1984, Martin van den Brink, a young Dutch engineer, joined a newly created venture in a quiet corner of the Netherlands. Little did he know then that about 40 years on the company would be so crucial to the $580 billion semiconductor industry that it would be the epicenter of a US-China chip war.Most Read from BloombergZelenskiy Denies Ukraine Sent Drones to Hit Putin, KremlinPacWest Is Weighing Strategic Options, Including Possible SaleNigeria Targeted a UK Mansion; Its Next Leader’s Son Now Owns ItBanker Pay Surges For Those Willing to Work in Saudi ArabiaUS Looks Past India’s Rights Record as China Worries DeepenASML Holding NV, where Van den Brink is now the chief technology officer, practically owns the market for a critical piece of equipment needed to produce the brains of everything that makes modern life possible — from cars and smartphones to computers, microwaves and airplanes. With the company’s high-end machines churning out chips that can also go into state-of-the-art weapons and artificial intelligence devices, ASML is effectively being treated as critical infrastructure for US national security and has become a target of industrial espionage for China.“I never expected to be where we are today,” said Van den Brink.Over his nearly four decades at the company, ASML has gone from a bit player competing with the likes of Nikon, Canon and Ultratech to the world’s only maker of very high-end semiconductor lithography equipment. Its ascent has made it Europe’s most valuable technology company, with a market capitalization of over $247 billion — more than twice that of its customer Intel Corp. In an industry where devices typically cost $10 million, ASML commands about $180 million for its current top-end machine. And although the chip market has softened recently, ASML is still growing and its long-term outlook seems intact, thanks to the insatiable demand for computing power.“This is a company that the world can’t exist without,” said Jon Bathgate, a fund manager at NZS Capital LLC in Denver, which has about $2 billion under management, with ASML as one of its biggest holdings. “They’ve got a 20-year head start… Investors have clearly realized how important ASML is as a company and how difficult it would be to replicate. It’s a natural monopoly with secular growth winds. That’s unique.”As chips become for geopolitics in the 21st century what oil was in the last one, ASML’s singular success has thrust it squarely in the crosshairs of the intensifying tensions between the US and China. With the US focused on the strategic importance of semiconductors, Presidents Donald Trump and Joe Biden have done everything to ensure that China is a couple of generations behind in chips. No company is more critical to that effort than ASML.“Most people in industry and government believe that lithography tools are the strongest of the choke points that Western governments have put in place,” said Chris Miller, an associate professor of international history at Tufts University and the author of Chip War. “Because of that, there’s been intense focus” on ASML.Barred from selling many of its top-end machines in China, and a victim of data thefts, ASML is doing the only thing it can to preserve its almost insurmountable lead: building evermore sophisticated machines. Its next contraption, about the size of an Amsterdam studio apartment, is set to hit markets in 2025. With a price tag of more than $380 million — costlier than a Boeing 787 Dreamliner — it will be capable of etching delicate patterns on silicon wafers smaller than a virus. Already way ahead of rivals, ASML is making sure no one can do what it does for the foreseeable future. Its only real hurdle will be technological limits — building machines that are viable and economical for mass production.“Even if someone is able to catch up with where we are today, we will make sure that in 10 years we are operating in a completely different paradigm,” Roger Dassen, the company’s chief financial officer, said in an interview. “That’s the best way we can protect our position... So you can catch up with where we are today, but we will be at a different place by then.”In 2019, under pressure from the Trump administration, the Dutch government withheld an export license enabling ASML to sell its top-of-the-line extreme ultraviolet, or EUV, lithography machines to SMIC, China’s main semiconductor foundry. Then, pushed by the Biden administration, the Netherlands tightened the screws further. Its March plan for additional restrictions would rein in exports of more advanced versions of ASML’s older immersion deep ultraviolet, or DUV, lithography machines that can be used with other technologies to make powerful chips for dual civil and military use.“The business risk for ASML strongly depends on two things: First, whether there will be a ban on a certain DUV equipment type, for example, the most advanced one, or if in the future, there will be a full DUV ban, which would have a much more severe impact,” said Julia Hess, project manager at Stiftung Neue Verantwortung, a German think tank. “Second, how the controls will be aligned with countries that have competing companies, such as Japan.”China is working on building its own semiconductor industry, pouring billions into a chip-building initiative to catch up to the US. Its purchase of older technology has boosted earnings for much of the semiconductor equipment sector. The Asian giant, which a decade ago was a rounding error for ASML, was its third-biggest market behind Taiwan and South Korea in 2022, accounting for about 15% of revenue.Not being able to sell more powerful equipment in China may become a drag on growth in the future, but for now ASML can barely keep up with its non-China demand, and says the bans have “no material effect.” Its backlog is almost twice its annual revenue, and its biggest customer Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp. isn’t cutting capital expenditure. Also, the US and Europe have unveiled plans to invest about $100 billion in the chip industry.But ASML Chief Executive Officer Peter Wennink still believes the China blockade is a mistake, saying it will hasten that country’s efforts to develop its own chip equipment.“If they cannot get those machines, they will develop them themselves,” he said in an interview. “That will take time, but ultimately they will get there… The more you put them under pressure, the more likely it is that they will double up their efforts.”Some Chinese individuals and entities have resorted to stealing ASML technology. The company, with about 1,500 people in China, disclosed in February that a former employee had taken some technical information. Last year, it accused a Beijing-based firm, regarded by Chinese officials as one of the country’s most promising tech ventures, of potentially stealing its trade secrets.ASML argued in a 2018 trial in California that Dongfang Jingyuan Electron Ltd. and defunct Silicon Valley firm Xtal were created a month apart in 2014 by a former employee named Zongchang Yu with the express purpose of stealing and transferring its technology to China. Yu now runs Dongfang in Beijing with ample support from the Chinese government, according to company statements and other Chinese documents.The case prompted ASML to protect its intellectual property more fiercely than even before. Its information security staff rose 20% from 2021 to 300. It created a “circle of trust” to train suppliers on cybersecurity risks and keeps tabs on any potential reverse engineering of its machines.CFO Dassen also points to the futility of attempts to steal the company’s technology. With 5,000 suppliers of everything from software to tin and tungsten and strategic partnerships with companies like Carl Zeiss AG, which makes its critical multilayer mirrors, ASML runs a global ecosystem that would be difficult to match, he notes.“A lot of ASML’s technology is not on blueprints,” he said. “It’s in the heads of people. And you don’t need just the blueprints; you need everything surrounding it and the entire supply chain. You have to build an alternative Zeiss etc. That is a colossal task. You’re not talking about months or years. You’re talking about a decade or more before you could replicate something like this.”A peek at how the company — based in a country better known for its canals, bicycles and cannabis-selling coffee shops — has cobbled together a vast, global ecosystem shows why there are no easy workarounds to ASML for China.“You cannot do it all,” said Van den Brink in a written response to questions, alluding to the company’s targeted acquisitions and partnerships. “You have to do the things that you’re good at. And work with other parties that are better in something than you could ever be. And then you can bring the best from yourself and the best from those around you together.”Headquartered in the tidy small town of Veldhoven in the Netherlands’s industrial heartland, ASML was all but written off a few decades ago as a bottomless pit for Philips, the Dutch conglomerate from which it was spun off. It struggled in the 1980s to find buyers for its equipment. Its 1995 initial public offering gave it the funds it needed for research, and a breakthrough in DUV lithography machines boosted its market share to nearly 50% in the early 2000s. Then, a moonshot development took it to a whole new level: EUV lithography.A US government-led EUV consortium had roped in ASML to see how marketable the technology was. Making a huge bet on EUV, something its rivals balked at, the company focused efforts over the next two decades on bringing it out of the lab and into salable machines. It worked with scientists from three US labs, got equity investments from Intel, TSMC and Samsung Electronics Co. in an unprecedented market collaboration, acquired some key US companies like Cymer and HMI, and signed up hundreds of suppliers across the globe. By 2018, it was ready to mass-produce EUV machines, and by 2021, it owned more than 90% of the $17.1 billion global market for lithography equipment.EUV lithography uses light of a shorter wavelength to allow chipmakers to cram exponentially higher numbers of transistors into integrated circuits to make powerful chips. The gigantic EUV machine, about the size of a school bus when fully assembled at a customer’s site, takes three to four Boeing 747s to deliver. Weighing 180 metric tons, it consists of more than 100,000 parts, 3,000 cables and 40,000 screws, and requires more than 2 kilometers of hoses.As the world’s only maker of such machines, ASML has left its rivals in the dust and shown how difficult it would be for a potential Chinese competitor to emerge.“It’s not even remotely possible” for anyone to catch up with ASML anytime soon, said Douglas O’Laughlin, an analyst at Fabricated Knowledge, an industry newsletter. “There is the potential for some kind of inflection that we’re not privy to right now. But all the people who would know how to do it probably work for ASML.”Access to ASML’s most advanced machines has dictated which companies succeed in the industry. Intel, which was slow to adopt EUV machines, fell off its perch as the world’s largest chipmaker last year after holding that spot for close to 30 years. TSMC, which took advantage of the new technology more quickly and is ASML’s biggest customer, is on course for that title this year, according to analysts’ projections, overtaking Samsung and relegating the US company to the third spot.As of the end of 2022, ASML had delivered 180 EUV systems. It plans to ship 60 EUVs this year, and wants to boost manufacturing capacity so it can almost double the number of the older DUV systems it produces to 600 by 2026. It also wants to build by 2030 as many as 30 of its next machine, dubbed high-NA EUV, which is slated for high-volume chip manufacturing in about two years.Semiconductor makers are keen to buy this newest machine because many emerging technologies require chips that are more powerful than the ones currently available, said Dylan Patel, chief analyst and founder of SemiAnalysis, an industry research and consulting firm. Features like Apple Inc.’s augmented reality headsets with high-density and long-lasting batteries or servers that could someday run the AI tool ChatGPT-7 are “just not possible with current technology,” he said. “High-NA EUV very well could be the thing that unlocks that.”That said, not everyone is convinced the transition to these increasingly complex machines will be smooth. For all the “respect and admiration” he has for ASML, the difficulties chipmakers are likely to encounter are not evident in the company’s stellar share price increase, says Timm Schulze-Melander at Redburn in London, who is the only analyst tracked by Bloomberg with a “sell” rating on ASML shares.“High-NA EUV has big technical as well as economic challenges that the consensus is not reflecting,” he said. “Even for existing EUV lithography, it’s worth remembering that the technology is difficult to run in high-volume manufacturing. Despite the hype, today only three chipmakers — TSMC, Samsung and SK Hynix — currently deliver chips made with EUV lithography. ”So how far can ASML economically take its miniaturizing technology? That’s the big question — more than the fear of a Chinese entity catching up with ASML. Even within the company, some worry that it is technology that will eventually limit the company.“The big long-term risk is that new lithography systems are too costly and unwieldy to produce,” said Chip War author Miller. “ASML will bring its high-NA systems online, but the generation after that, hyper-NA, is still in development. Some ASML staff have speculated it may be too difficult to mass-produce.”Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekTwitter’s Unpaid Bills Threaten to Be an Even Bigger Problem for Elon MuskEurope’s ‘Golden Visa’ Programs Are Dying Out as Housing Costs RiseCadillac’s Lyriq EV Might Be a Winner If GM Can Build Enough of ThemThe Company Behind Ben Shapiro Is Trying to Build a Right-Wing Magic KingdomWhy Chinese Banks Aren’t Worried About Depositors Fleeing©2023 Bloomberg L.P.","April 26, 2023 at 6:00 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/asml-europe-most-valuable-tech-230007937.html,Bloomberg,0.15,0.45,0.13960070892410345,0.5005302864821214

INTC,"ASML Holding, Lam Research call for a boom in chip equipment sales to China","Yahoo Finance Live’s Ines Ferre discusses the demand for chips to Chinese customers and the outlook for the semiconductor mining and fabrication industry.Meanwhile, the US is working to develop its chip making infrastructure. For more on the current direction of the semiconductor industry, let's get to Yahoo Finance's Ines Ferre. Hey, Ines.So they're both expecting strong demand coming out of China. Now, the US, last year, had announced that it was imposing some restrictions on exports into China of certain chips, and also manufacturing tools for those chips. But that involves the more advanced chips. So you still see chips that are going into the EV vehicles, for example. The demand for those are growing in China.And those are the types of chips that we're talking about when it comes to the Chinese customers for ASML and for LAM. When it comes to that strong demand that they are seeing, that will continue out of China. So LAM and ASML say that these Chinese customers are buying tools for building the less advanced chips, those chips that go into EVs, those chips that go into mobile phones that also go into laptops.And this is all happening really when you are seeing each region of the world or the major regions of the world, trying to become more self-sufficient when it comes to making chips because of the supply chain issues that we saw during the pandemic and also because of security concerns as well.So Europe just approved an EU Chips Act that's aimed at building capacity for building chips in and out of the EU, also making the EU just basically more self-sufficient in trying to avoid those supply chain issues that I just mentioned. As far as where the chip sector is going, analysts are seeing a recovery in the second half of 2023 after an inventory digestion. And you just had a Jefferies analyst that have a buy rating on LAM saying, investors are underestimating the potential for a v-shaped recovery, which is often what happens after a material inventory correction, Rochelle.So when you're taking a look at the overall sort of health of the industry, they do see that a stronger second half of the year, which kind of jives with what analysts are also saying. They're seeing a second stronger half for the year or so. They're expecting even stronger 2024, Rochelle.","April 21, 2023 at 10:37 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/asml-holding-lam-research-call-153746183.html,Yahoo Finance Video,0.0,0.0,0.15404104823747677,0.37040816326530607

INTC,A Look At The Intrinsic Value Of Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC),"Using the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity, Intel fair value estimate is US$28.01With US$30.86 share price, Intel appears to be trading close to its estimated fair value Check out our latest analysis for Intel We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) -US$8.59b-US$2.15bUS$1.72bUS$7.19bUS$10.2bUS$12.6bUS$14.7bUS$16.5bUS$18.0bUS$19.3bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x8Analyst x8Analyst x5Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 22.97%Est @ 16.70%Est @ 12.31%Est @ 9.24%Est @ 7.09% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 11% -US$7.7k-US$1.7kUS$1.3kUS$4.7kUS$6.1kUS$6.7kUS$7.1kUS$7.2kUS$7.1kUS$6.8kAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 11%.The total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$116b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$30.9, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.Now the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Intel as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 11%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.493. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.StrengthDebt is not viewed as a risk.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Semiconductor market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio compared to estimated Fair P/E ratio.Significant insider buying over the past 3 months.ThreatPaying a dividend but company has no free cash flows.Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Whilst important, the DCF calculation shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. For Intel, we've compiled three further aspects you should consider:","April 21, 2023 at 7:00 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/look-intrinsic-value-intel-corporation-120029842.html,Simply Wall St.,0.0,0.0,0.09740259740259738,0.4230364873222016

INTC,Earnings Preview: Intel (INTC) Q1 Earnings Expected to Decline,"Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when Intel (INTC) reports results for the quarter ended March 2023. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on April 27, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis world's largest chipmaker is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.16 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -118.4%.Revenues are expected to be $11.05 billion, down 39.8% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 42.86% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Intel?For Intel, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -3.01%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Intel will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Intel would post earnings of $0.20 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.10, delivering a surprise of -50%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Intel doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Intel Corporation (INTC) : Free Stock Analysis ReportTo read this article on Zacks.com click here.Zacks Investment Research","April 20, 2023 at 9:03 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-intel-intc-q1-140302886.html,Zacks,-0.1,0.4,0.09076131365287995,0.4738847163545957

ATVI,Microsoft hires Brussels-beating lawyer to take on Britains competition watchdog,"Microsoft has hired a lawyer who has repeatedly defeated the EU as it seeks to overturn a decision by Britain’s competition regulator to block its £55bn gaming takeover.The US tech giant has enlisted Daniel Beard KC as it prepares to lodge an appeal at the Competition Appeal Tribunal in the coming days.Mr Beard of Monckton Chambers is seen as a leading competition barrister and has overturned multi-billion dollar penalties levied on Apple and Intel by the EU in recent years.Last year, Mr Beard overturned a €1.1bn fine handed to Intel more than a decade ago after the European Commission had claimed the company had abused its dominance of the microchip market. The case was seen as a landmark blow for Brussels’ attempts to rein in Big Tech.Mr Beard had represented Microsoft in the late stages of hearings with the CMA, before the regulator blocked the takeover in April.An appeal at the Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT) is likely to take several months, beyond the July 18 deadline for the two companies to complete the deal. The timeline is already likely to be extended because US regulators have launched a legal challenge to the deal.If Microsoft successfully appeals the CMA’s ruling, the case can be sent back to the regulator to reconsider its decision. If the CAT refuses the case, the company can then take the case to the Court of Appeal.In addition to representing Apple and Intel, Mr Beard represented Sky in seeking to overturn a 2007 Government decision that the broadcaster must sell down its stake in ITV, which it eventually lost. He also argued for Tesco in 2009 as the supermarket overturned a Competition Commission ruling that planning permission for new stores should require a competition test.Microsoft has said it remains “fully committed” to the deal despite the CMA block. Activision’s chief executive Bobby Kotick has said the company will support Microsoft’s appeal.He said when the deal was blocked: “We’re confident in our case because the facts are on our side: this deal is good for competition.”Mr Kotick has said that over regulation will mean the company reassessing its growth plans in the UK.The Government plans to grant the CMA new powers to issue hefty fines to tech companies that are seen as abusing their position.Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

ATVI,"Activision Blizzard, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:ATVI) latest 12% decline adds to one-year losses, institutional investors may consider drastic measures","Significantly high institutional ownership implies Activision Blizzard's stock price is sensitive to their trading actionsThe top 25 shareholders own 50% of the company Insiders have sold recently As a result, institutional investors endured the highest losses last week after market cap fell by US$8.3b. Needless to say, the recent loss which further adds to the one-year loss to shareholders of 3.5% might not go down well especially with this category of shareholders. Also referred to as ""smart money"", institutions have a lot of sway over how a stock's price moves. As a result, if the decline continues, institutional investors may be pressured to sell Activision Blizzard which might hurt individual investors.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Activision Blizzard, beginning with the chart below. See our latest analysis for Activision Blizzard Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Activision Blizzard. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Activision Blizzard's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.Since institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Activision Blizzard. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 7.9% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 7.2% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 6.7% by the third-largest shareholder. In addition, we found that Robert Kotick, the CEO has 0.5% of the shares allocated to their name.After doing some more digging, we found that the top 25 have the combined ownership of 50% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.The general public-- including retail investors -- own 16% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.We can see that public companies hold 6.7% of the Activision Blizzard shares on issue. We can't be certain but it is quite possible this is a strategic stake. The businesses may be similar, or work together.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

ATVI,RPT-EXPLAINER-What next for Microsoft's $69 bln Activision deal after UK ban?,"(Repeats April 28 item with no changes to text)By Paul SandleLONDON, April 28 (Reuters) - Britain's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) on Wednesday blocked Microsoft's $69 billion acquisition of 'Call of Duty' maker Activision Blizzard over concerns it would hinder cloud gaming.The ruling was a shock after the regulator had already resolved its concerns about the consoles market, a sector dominated by Sony's PlayStation and Microsoft's Xbox, which dwarfs cloud gaming.IS THE DEAL DEAD?Not necessarily. Microsoft said it remained fully committed and would appeal.The regulator's decision reflected a flawed understanding of the market, it said.HOW DOES THE APPEAL PROCESS WORK?Microsoft can appeal to Britain's Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT), an independent judicial body, which will only examine the CMA's decision-making process, not the merits of the merger.Microsoft will not be able to offer new remedies at this stage, such as offering to keep Activision content off its Xbox Game Pass, a subscription service for Xbox users, in Britain, as some analysts suggest.""The CAT will not engage with the merits of the CMA's decision or conduct a wholesale review of the parties' evidence,"" said Edward Lane, senior associate at law firm Harbottle & Lewis, where his particular focus is on creative industries, including film, TV, video games and music.WHAT'S NEXT?Microsoft must appeal by May 24 and a decision may take many months.""The CAT aims to deal with 'straightforward' cases in under nine months – and Microsoft/Activision is anything but straightforward,"" Lane, said.WHAT HAPPENS IF MICROSOFT WINS?The Tribunal will return the case to the regulator for further review. Microsoft can then offer new concessions.""The likelihood is that without a material change in circumstances or new evidence, the CMA is most likely to reach the same conclusion as it did first time around,"" said James Groves, a competition associate at European law firm Fieldfisher.WHAT ABOUT OTHER REGULATORS?European regulators will rule on the world's biggest gaming deal by May 22. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission filed a complaint to block the deal, which Microsoft has indicated it will fight.If either of those blocks the deal, it could be game over, Lane said.If the EU goes against it, Microsoft would be fighting an increasingly uphill battle and could decide to cut its losses, even if that would mean paying Activision a hefty $3 billion break fee.WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO OTHER CMA APPEALS?Facebook-owner Meta appealed a 2021 decision by the CMA to block its acquisition of Giphy, seen as a test case for the British regulator's resolve to take on ""Big Tech"".Meta succeeded on a single procedural ground, with the decision otherwise upheld. The CMA considered new submissions, but it came to the same view and Meta had to sell animated images platform Giphy.Global financial services company FNZ appealed a block on its 2019 merger with rival GBST. The regulator then ""identified certain potential errors"" in its investigation chaired by Martin Coleman, who also oversaw the Microsoft-Activision case.The CAT sent the case back to be reconsidered, and the CMA agreed to accept a new remedy whereby FNZ could sell GBST and then buy parts of it back.(Reporting by Paul Sandle; Editing by Josephine Mason and Tomasz Janowski)","May 2, 2023 at 12:00 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rpt-explainer-next-microsofts-69-050000670.html,Reuters,0.0,0.0,0.03760110503531555,0.42927916381863757

ATVI,Activisions UK division faces HMRC investigation over diverted profits,"A UK subsidiary of the Call of Duty developer disclosed in its most recent accounts that it had “settled tax liabilities” worth $31m (£25m) with HMRC and was facing further questions over diverted profits and “transfer pricing” arrangements.The dispute has rumbled on as Activision attempted to secure a merger with US tech giant Microsoft, a $69bn deal and the largest takeover ever in the video games sector.The decision prompted a furious reaction from Activision, which threatened to “reassess our growth plans” for Britain and warned the UK was “clearly closed for business”. Activision and Microsoft pledged to appeal the decision.While Activision has sparred with the UK’s competition watchdog, it has also been locked in talks with HMRC over its tax affairs.Accounts for its UK subsidiary, Midasplayer.com Ltd, show it agreed to pay millions of pounds to the taxman over a “TP [transfer pricing] and DPT [diverted profit tax] enquiry”.Midasplayer is owned by King.com Limited, which is registered in Malta and owned by Activision.King is the developer of hit mobile apps such as Candy Crush, the colourful smartphone puzzle game, which Activision acquired for $6bn in 2015.The island nation has faced accusations of operating as a tax haven.Activision’s UK mobile gaming company paid £25m in settlements in 2020, while discussions over further tax matters dating from 2016 to 2020 were ongoing as of the signing of its accounts in September last year.The business reported profits of $469m in the year ending December 2021, paying $11.7m in total taxes.According to Blizzard’s US filings, the company is engaged in a “collaborative multilateral process with tax authorities” in the UK and Sweden over its King division.In February this year, HMRC disclosed it was “currently carrying out around 100 reviews into multinationals with arrangements to divert profits… the total amount of tax under consideration in these cases was £2.4bn at the end of March 2022”.The diverted profit tax, known as the “Google tax”, was introduced by George Osborne in 2015, allowing HMRC to chase down multinationals that had tried to avoid paying enough tax on UK profits by routing it overseas.The levy could be charged on diverted profits at a rate 5pc higher than normal corporation tax.","May 1, 2023 at 7:07 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/activision-uk-division-faces-hmrc-120731687.html,The Telegraph,0.0,0.0,0.04865079365079365,0.434920634920635
ATVI,Microsofts threats against the UK could backfire,"“It should be as much the aim of those who seek for social betterment to rid the business world of crimes of cunning, as to rid the entire body politic of crimes of violence,” President Roosevelt told Congress in his State of the Union Address in 1901.Today, the Roosevelts – Theodore and Franklin Delano – are credited with saving capitalism from the populists and socialists who wanted to burn the house down.Both challenged the idea that business should do exactly as it pleased.Yet today “Big Tech” platforms have replaced a functioning marketplace with systems they control, carefully rationing the information that both producers and consumers need. That’s a “crime of cunning” few can comprehend. So the world has changed, but competition policy hasn’t. Last week, the UK made its move.After Brexit, Smith said the European Union was now a “more attractive place” than the UK. And darkly, he also mentioned national security, when he said “we play a vital role not just supporting businesses and nonprofits but even defending the nation from cybersecurity threats”.Would Microsoft really leave us vulnerable because it couldn’t get the rights to Call of Duty? Such threats may backfire, and it all rather smacks of entitlement.They fear the CMA’s new doctrine may one day deny them a well-deserved cash out. But others whisper that high quality content creators must be able to set the price for their goods in a fair negotiation, and they see what can happen in the platform world, where a dominant distributor sets the terms of trade. Entrepreneurs still quite like the idea of growing the company that they founded independently.There is a growing conservative support in the US for taming a censorious Big Tech. Many were wary of handing even more market power to Microsoft, which is already a giant games publisher.Some will doubtless recall how key Microsoft products, such as its Internet Explorer web browser, languished and became dilapidated over the years from neglect, once the threat of competition diminished. However to be fair, Microsoft’s games story is a little different.The games division somehow evaded the savage corporate infighting and entropy at Microsoft under its previous CEO, Steve Ballmer, that had made other arms such dysfunctional operations. It deserves the success it enjoys today.As the CMA explained: “the cloud allows UK gamers to avoid buying expensive gaming consoles and PCs and gives them much more flexibility and choice as to how they play.”Blocking such acquisitions entails a major philosophical break with the principle that has guided competition regulators for 40 years. This is the idea that lower prices trump all other considerations. In US law this is enshrined as “the consumer welfare standard”.“In the US now it’s broadly accepted now that the consumer welfare standard is dead – but we need new ideas,” says Caffara, now a managing partner at Keystone.The problem is that as Big Tech has grown more dominant, the very idea of markets has fallen out of fashion. Those who once defended them have become mindless cheerleaders for monopolies. And one senses that if it was all left to Labour, they’d be quite happy with monopolies, so long as they can tax them every now and again.So regulators are stumbling towards new thinking on competition that’s more reflective of the dominance of Big Tech, largely alone. They have a sympathetic public to call on, but few friends. We can hardly blame the CMA for trying, no matter how clumsily, to address a very real problem.Andrew Orlowski is on Twitter @andreworlowski","May 1, 2023 at 4:00 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-threats-against-uk-could-090000712.html,The Telegraph,0.0,0.0,0.09085964035964036,0.42681601731601726

ATVI,4 big deal reports: Activision plunges on blocked Microsoft buyout | Pro Recap,"Investing.com -- Here is your Pro Recap of the biggest head-turning deal dispatches you may have missed this week: a shocking block for the Microsoft-Activision buyout in the U.K.; a scramble to save the failing First Republic Bank; a multibillion-dollar deal for Carrier Global; and Getty Images' response to an unsolicited bid from an activist investor.Shares of Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) plummeted more than 11% on Wednesday after the United Kingdom's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) issued an order blocking Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) $68.7 billion pending acquisition of the company.The CMA's final ruling cited concerns that the deal would harm competition in the fast-growing cloud gaming market, potentially leading to reduced innovation and choice for U.K. gamers in the years to come.The agency also noted that Microsoft's prior proposed solutions failed to address these concerns, with significant shortcomings requiring regulatory oversight. Panel Chair Martin Coleman emphasized that cloud gaming requires a free, competitive market to drive innovation and choice.The proposed merger has faced roadblocks in the U.K. since its announcement in January 2022, with an in-depth review launched in September of the same year.According to BMO Capital, this is a shocking development as the CMA had previously concluded that the deal would not hurt competition in the console market, which seemed the more significant concern. The CMA was always clear that it was skeptical about the cloud gaming market. Activision Blizzard has announced that it intends to collaborate with Microsoft to appeal the decision.After a shattering week for First Republic Bank (NYSE:FRC) investors, U.S. regulators were attempting over the weekend to secure a sale of the failing bank.According to Reuters, sources say about a half-dozen banks are bidding for First Republic, among them Citizens Financial (NYSE:CFG), PNC Financial (NYSE:PNC), and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM). The bidding process is being run by the Federal Deposit Insurance Company, sources told Reuters, and a deal should be announced by Sunday night.This week saw steep declines in the shares that began when the bank disclosed $100B in customer withdrawals the previous month.In an effort to stabilize the bank's finances, First Republic's advisors had attempted to persuade larger U.S. banks to acquire bonds from them at above-market prices, as reported by CNBC.Shares closed the week with a massive 75% loss.Carrier Global (NYSE:CARR) has confirmed its acquisition of Viessmann Climate Solutions for €12B in cash (80%) and stock (20%), with the stock issued directly to Viessmann Group under a long-term ownership commitment.The acquisition reinforces Carrier's position as a leading player in the European climate and energy transition market, positioning the company for sustainable growth.Following the announcement, several Wall Street firms lowered their price targets on the stock, including Barclays with a new target of $48.00 (from $50.00), Citi with a new target of $45.00 (from $48.00), RBC Capital with a new target of $48.00 (from $54.00), and Morgan Stanley with a new target of $49.00 (from $50.00).Shares fell more than 7% this week.Getty Images (NYSE:GETY) shares jumped 31% on Monday after activist investor Trillium Capital announced that it has made a bid to acquire the company for $10 per share in cash.However, the next day shares fell more than 4% as Getty Images said the offer is not sufficiently credible to warrant engagement by its Board.Shares closed the week with a 27% gain.Related Articles4 big deal reports: Activision plunges on blocked Microsoft buyout | Pro RecapUBS looks to bring Naratil back and mulls Swiss bank spin-off - NZZ4 hot insider trades: Enphase director buys $4.6M in stock | Pro Recap","April 30, 2023 at 12:56 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-big-deal-reports-activision-055613132.html,Investing.com,0.0,0.1,0.06391184573002755,0.42484504132231415
ATVI,Brexit has ushered in a new nanny state,"But what's this?It is as though Britain is in competition with the EU over quite how punitively politically suspect – though entirely legitimate – business activity might be treated.In both cases, this seems to be more a case of taking back control so as to exercise more of it than freeing business from the well-intentioned but enterprise-crushing burden of EU constraint.To have left the European Union only to become more like it seems an odd path to tread.It says a lot about the deficiencies at the heart of the UK economy that gaming and online gambling are in fact two of Britain's most successful industries.According to the Competition and Markets Authority, the gaming industry alone is the UK's largest revenue-generating form of entertainment, with around £5bn in annual revenue, or more than pay TV, video streaming, cinema, music and books.Some of these strictures, which come overwhelmingly from the two parties with the most to lose, should no doubt be treated sceptically.The CMA's decision has effectively scuppered the entire deal, with limited chances of reversal on appeal. It is understandable that Microsoft, which has been working on the transaction for the best part of two years and sees it as key to the company's future, should be angry.But has confidence in the UK really been as “severely shaken” as Mr Smith claims?This seems a little far fetched. There are surely much bigger threats to Britain's “world beating” position in gaming content – tax and the wider regulatory framework for business prime among them – than this.Microsoft is substantially invested in the UK, and has spent decades building its presence here. It is not about to write this off in a petulant fit of pique, and nor is Activision, which is similarly a big employer in the UK.In order to get the deal through, they could conceivably quit the UK market for cloud gaming, but this would be difficult, if not impossible.The threat of such action none the less raises a serious point.The European authorities have, perhaps surprisingly, taken a much more relaxed view of the Activision takeover than the CMA, and indeed seemed minded to accept the very same behavioural remedies proposed by Microsoft that the CMA has rejected.Indeed, were it not for Brexit, the CMA would have had little or no traction on the merger in the first place, even if admittedly it could have fed into the European judgment.As it is, the CMA is fast establishing itself as the world's most hawkish global enforcer, and what is more, one with the powers to ensure that its actions actually have some effect.Think of it like this: if Norway was to put its foot down and banned Microsoft from acquiring Activision, nobody would bat an eyelid.Microsoft and Activision would simply close their businesses in Norway and move on, little or no harm done to their merger or ongoing business activity. Norway is too small to matter.Yet if the EU were to do the same, the two companies would have no option but to abandon the merger. The EU is the biggest consumer market in the world, and even the mighty Microsoft cannot afford to be out of it.The UK sits somewhere in between. It is too large a market for Microsoft to easily bypass, but not so large that it would be unthinkable.If you believe your plans are going to be constantly scuppered by UK enforcers, you will in time take steps to disengage from the jurisdiction.Nor is it just big multinational corporations where this way of thinking might apply.Smaller, entrepreneurial ventures, like, say, the very same gaming content providers the UK is so good at spawning, might think twice about investing here if they thought attempts to sell the business might be blocked.The CMA's actions also look disproportionate on the specifics of the deal.The CMA finds no reason to block the takeover when it comes to console gaming, which currently accounts for the overwhelming bulk of the $280bn a year global market.Rather it is Microsoft's potential for dominating cloud gaming – widely recognised as the future once current technical and capacity constraints are overcome – that the CMA worries about.Those concerns are instructed by the network effects of Microsoft's already market leading positions in operating systems and cloud computing, and rightly so in some respects.Furthermore, tech giants such as Microsoft are notorious for gobbling up innovative players in order to snuff out potential future competition.Yet in effectively deciding that big tech should be banned from future takeovers, the CMA's Sarah Cardell has in essence substituted her own judgement for that of the markets, where for the moment there is no competition issue of significance.Truth be told, the CMA has as little idea as you and me how these markets might evolve.The only two significant complainants were Sony and Google, both of whom have skin in the game, and are not averse to using regulators to protect their own incumbent positions.I note that Ian Livingstone, who as co-founder of Games Workshop can reasonably claim to be the godfather of British gaming, seems relatively unconcerned about Microsoft's ambitions.Indeed, many UK content providers see Microsoft's assault on cloud gaming as more of an opportunity than a threat, opening up potentially vast new markets beyond the exclusivity and anti-competitive practices of consoles.Let's protect consumers from egregious big tech by all means, but not on the basis of imagined threats or at the expense of desperately needed investment in UK tech.","April 29, 2023 at 7:00 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/brexit-ushered-nanny-state-120000446.html,The Telegraph,0.13636363636363635,0.45454545454545453,0.1375311196739768,0.4532376353804925

Microsoft said it remained fully committed and would appeal.The regulator's decision reflected a flawed understanding of the market, it said.HOW DOES THE APPEAL PROCESS WORK?Microsoft can appeal to Britain's Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT), an independent judicial body, which will only examine the CMA's decision-making process, not the merits of the merger.Microsoft will not be able to offer new remedies at this stage, such as offering to keep Activision content off its Xbox Game Pass, a subscription service for Xbox users, in Britain, as some analysts suggest.""The CAT will not engage with the merits of the CMA's decision or conduct a wholesale review of the parties' evidence,"" said Edward Lane, senior associate at law firm Harbottle & Lewis, where his particular focus is on creative industries, including film, TV, video games and music.WHAT'S NEXT?Microsoft must appeal by May 24 and a decision may take many months.""The CAT aims to deal with 'straightforward' cases in under nine months – and Microsoft/Activision is anything but straightforward,"" Lane, said.WHAT HAPPENS IF MICROSOFT WINS?The Tribunal will return the case to the regulator for further review. Microsoft can then offer new concessions.""The likelihood is that without a material change in circumstances or new evidence, the CMA is most likely to reach the same conclusion as it did first time around,"" said James Groves, a competition associate at European law firm Fieldfisher.WHAT ABOUT OTHER REGULATORS?European regulators will rule on the world's biggest gaming deal by May 22. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission filed a complaint to block the deal, which Microsoft has indicated it will fight.If either of those blocks the deal, it could be game over, Lane said.If the EU goes against it, Microsoft would be fighting an increasingly uphill battle and could decide to cut its losses, even if that would mean paying Activision a hefty $3 billion break fee.WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO OTHER CMA APPEALS?Facebook-owner Meta appealed a 2021 decision by the CMA to block its acquisition of Giphy, seen as a test case for the British regulator's resolve to take on ""Big Tech"".Meta succeeded on a single procedural ground, with the decision otherwise upheld. The CMA considered new submissions, but it came to the same view and Meta had to sell animated images platform Giphy.Global financial services company FNZ appealed a block on its 2019 merger with rival GBST. The regulator then ""identified certain potential errors"" in its investigation chaired by Martin Coleman, who also oversaw the Microsoft-Activision case.The CAT sent the case back to be reconsidered, and the CMA agreed to accept a new remedy whereby FNZ could sell GBST and then buy parts of it back.(Reporting by Paul Sandle; Editing by Josephine Mason and Tomasz Janowski)","April 28, 2023 at 10:35 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/explainer-next-microsofts-69-bln-153539205.html,Reuters,0.0,0.0,0.03760110503531555,0.42927916381863757

ATVI,It makes no sense: Activision CEO Bobby Kotick slams U.K. blocking of $69 billion Microsoft deal as clearly irrational,"“Cloud gaming is an inconsequential part of the business,” he insisted, adding that mobile gaming accounted for a much larger proportion of the industry.“The idea that somehow [the CMA is] protecting all of these big, foreign competitors from market competition makes no sense,” he said, noting that Microsoft had made it clear it would continue to provide cloud gaming content to other providers after the deal.Kotick also suggested that rather than standing in the way of innovation, the Microsoft-Activision deal would have enhanced it.“The opportunity we have with Microsoft is to give them more access to mobile talent, mobile technology, and that is something they saw as incredibly valuable,” he said. “There is an enormous amount of talent at Microsoft, that if we were to have access to, would allow us to grow even better.”Kotick’s criticism of the U.K. government came as Microsoft’s president, Brad Smith, also lashed out at the country’s blocking of its deal.He had earlier said in a statement that the CMA’s decision appeared to reflect “a flawed understanding of this market and the way the relevant cloud technology actually works.”Both Microsoft and Activision have said they will appeal the CMA’s decision.“We have every expectation, as does Microsoft, that we should prevail in an appeal,” Kotick told Bloomberg on Thursday. “We think the appeals process will work in our favor.”Microsoft and Activision’s purchase agreement has a July deadline. Neither party has said whether they will extend the agreement beyond the current cutoff.","April 28, 2023 at 6:53 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/makes-no-sense-activision-ceo-115302468.html,Fortune,0.10000000000000002,0.3833333333333333,0.11785714285714285,0.4773809523809524

ATVI,Microsoft's 'good guy' approach frays in UK gaming battle,"Microsoft's charm offensive with the world's governments is starting to lose some of its luster as the software giant is confronting its toughest antitrust scrutiny since co-founder Bill Gates was in charge.Microsoft's policy chief responded by calling it a “bad day for Britain” that could make it an unattractive place to do business and warned Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's government “it needs to look hard” at the role of its antitrust regulator.“This decision, I have to say, is probably the darkest day in our four decades in Britain,"" the company's president, Brad Smith, told BBC Radio 4. ""It does more than shake our confidence in the future of the opportunity to grow a technology business in Britain than we’ve ever confronted before.”The sharp tone marked a shift for Microsoft, and Smith in particular, who joined the company in 1993 and helped defend it from antitrust enforcers in the U.S. and Europe who targeted the company's personal computer software empire centered around the Windows operating system.“Basically, this is Microsoft and Brad Smith throwing their toys out of the pram after they didn’t get the decision they wanted after all the lobbying they did,” said Max von Thun, director of the Europe office of the Open Markets Institute, a proponent of stronger antitrust enforcement.After legal battles starting in the late 1990s, Microsoft came close to having to break up its business but ended up agreeing to concessions instead. It was eclipsed for a time by rivals like Google, Facebook and Amazon, which drew closer scrutiny from both Wall Street and regulators. Now, it’s back, both as a powerhouse in sectors such as artificial intelligence and cloud computing and as a target for antitrust enforcement.“They’re struggling to maintain that ‘good guy’ reputation,” von Thun said.After adopting a confrontational attitude toward regulators at the turn of the century, Microsoft's senior leaders, led by Smith, have spent years crafting a friendlier and collaborative approach, said William Kovacic, former chair of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.“That generated a great deal of goodwill for them around the world,"" Kovacic said. ”They’re seen as being in a different category than the other well-known information technology giants. They’re seen as being more reasonable, thoughtful.""But it’s not just Microsoft that has changed. Behind the heightened attention on technology companies is a belief that regulators were too weak over the past two decades in preventing monopolies. Kovacic said the “halo effect” of pitching itself as a good partner with governments only goes so far if the regulator believes a deal could harm competition. Not only that, but some of the dozens of nations with antitrust laws are increasingly talking with each other.“A number of jurisdictions are coming to realize that their effectiveness increases if they operate as a coalition,” Kovacic said. “They share thoughts about strategy. They share thoughts about timing.”In his comments to the BBC, Smith said the “English Channel has never seemed wider” as he compared the United Kingdom unfavorably with regulators for the 27-nation European Union, who are due to make a decision on the Activision deal in May.Smith said that “people are shocked, people are disappointed” by the U.K. decision. Microsoft and Activision have vowed to appeal.The company may end up with a more favorable ruling in Brussels, but Microsoft still has to contend with the FTC, which has challenged the deal in the U.S. and is taking the company to trial in August.“We're not alone,” Sarah Cardell, chief executive of Britain's Competition and Markets Authority, told BBC 4's Today program of her agency's decision and the pending FTC lawsuit. “There is a lot of alignment there.”Cardell defended the decision, saying the U.K. is “absolutely open for business"" and the regulator wants “to create an environment where a whole host of different companies can compete effectively, can grow and innovate.""The regulator's concern was over cloud gaming, or games streamed over the internet, which represents a tiny fraction of the industry today but where Microsoft, owner of the Xbox game system, already has the most powerful platform and would become more so with the Activision takeover, making it harder for other platforms to compete, Cardell said.Macquarie Group analyst Sarah Hindlian-Bowler said it will “be challenging, but possible” for Microsoft to complete its Activision takeover without the U.K.'s support. She also said it made sense for Smith to call out the CMA, a relatively new body formed several years before Britain's exit from the EU.“Microsoft is dancing an incredibly delicate ballet,” Hindlian-Bowler said. ""I think the aggressive comments from Microsoft really are intended to get British lawmakers and the British people to be really aware that this body, that I think is attempting to do good, may actually do more to set the U.K. back.""Microsoft also has faced other scrutiny, including complaints to European regulators that it is leveraging its position to lock customers into its Azure computing platform or bundling its Teams communications software with the rest of its Office suite of workplace products. And while Microsoft has endorsed broad AI safeguards, the rapid commercialization of ChatGPT-like products could bring about conflicts for the company amid a growing push to rein in the technology.—————————AP writer Kelvin Chan in London contributed to this report.","April 27, 2023 at 3:09 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microsofts-good-guy-approach-frays-200915630.html,AP Finance,0.7,0.6000000000000001,0.05292446524064172,0.4629957664884135

ATVI,Microsofts $69 Billion Deal Tripped Up by Niche Gaming Market,"(Bloomberg) -- UK regulators blocked Microsoft Corp.’s $69 billion purchase of Activision Blizzard Inc. over concerns it would harm competition in cloud gaming, a small but growing segment of the industry.Most Read from BloombergChina Takes the Yuan Global in Bid to Repel a Weaponized DollarZelenskiy Denies Ukraine Sent Drones to Hit Putin, KremlinTD, First Horizon End $13 Billion Merger as Regulators StallBank Drama Rages On; Apple Climbs in Late Trading: Markets WrapPacWest Is Weighing Strategic Options, Including Possible SaleAnalysts expressed surprise Wednesday that UK regulators would move to thwart a deal in a nascent field where companies are still finding their footing. Cloud gaming is dwarfed by the larger console-based business.The UK Competition and Markets Authority ruled Wednesday that Activision titles like Call of Duty would bolster Microsoft’s edge over rivals in cloud gaming, threatening growth in the sector. The companies plan to appeal.Titles like World of Warcraft and Overwatch “will be important for the competitive offering of cloud gaming services as the market continues to grow and develop,” the authority said in a statement. The regulator concluded that under Microsoft, Activision wouldn’t have enough incentive to seed its games across multiple services.The UK decision could ultimately stop the deal if Microsoft is unable to win on appeal. The merger agreement expires on July 18, though it can be extended. The breakup fee is $3 billion.Read The CMA Statement HereAnalysts were baffled that concerns over the evolution of cloud-based play could prove fatal to the biggest-ever deal in gaming. After three years, Alphabet Inc.’s Google shuttered its Stadia cloud-gaming offering in January, while Amazon.com Inc.’s Luna has seen dozens of games leave its subscription service.Regulators more often focus on deals that threaten competition in mature, developed markets. But the UK action Wednesday reflects a growing emphasis on deals that could impede rivalry in the future. The Federal Trade Commission, for example, didn’t challenge Facebook’s $1 billion acquisition of Instagram in 2012 and was criticized later for letting the world’s largest social network eliminate what probably would have become a major competitor. These days, regulators are increasingly focused on emerging industries, like cancer detection and virtual reality.Cloud-based gaming services generated just $5.1 billion in 2022 revenue, while console-game sales amounted to nearly $35 billion, according to research firm Omdia.Read More: Microsoft’s Activision Deal Chances Evaporate After UK Blow“It’s just not a big market,” said Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, citing cloud gaming’s volatility and potential to change. “It doesn’t make sense that Microsoft would keep nascent cloud gaming services that haven’t even been imagined yet from launching by locking up content.”He compared the agency’s reasoning to the idea that no other streaming service could compete with Netflix Inc.Cloud gaming involves streaming from data centers to devices, including mobile phones and smart TVs. Some analysts and executives argue the market could one day eat into gaming consoles’ market share by increasing access to top-tier games on less sophisticated hardware. Success in the market depends in part on the strength of gaming services’ catalogs, the CMA said.While standalone cloud gaming services have struggled to penetrate the mainstream gaming market, Microsoft’s Game Pass subscription service, which has a cloud gaming offering, is popular and growing.As part of a Netflix-for-games approach, Microsoft charges 25 million-plus Game Pass subscribers $10 to $15 a month to play over 400 games across the Xbox game console, Microsoft’s Windows PC operating system, smart TVs, tablets and smartphones. The Game Pass’s highest-tier offering lets users stream games from Microsoft’s international network of data centers to their phones with Xbox’s beta Cloud Gaming service.Microsoft currently has a 60% to 70% share of the global cloud gaming market, according to the CMA. Sony Group Corp. has a parallel offering, PlayStation Plus. Although PlayStation Plus boasts about 46 million subscribers, the service doesn’t offer splashy new releases on their day of launch. Sony also doesn’t own its own data centers.Analysts on Wednesday questioned whether the CMA was making an apples-to-oranges comparison between the Microsoft Game Pass’s cloud offering and those of Amazon, Sony, Nvidia Corp. and others.“I think they’re rather misinformed on what the cloud gaming market is,” said Joost Van Dreunen, who lectures at New York University’s Stern business school. “They’re conflating cloud gaming with the revenue model. Then they’re looking at it as a distinct technology and a market in another sense.”For example, the CMA may be overstating the Game Pass’s role in Microsoft’s cloud gaming dominance when cloud gaming is just one feature of the service.“I don’t think we can compare the way Microsoft uses cloud gaming to the way Amazon uses it for Luna,” said Joost Rietveld, an associate professor of strategy and entrepreneurship at University College London’s School of Management. “The market share is driven by the popularity of Game Pass, not the popularity of cloud gaming within gamers.”It’s an argument that analysts say Microsoft and Activision may invoke when they appeal. Activision on Wednesday called the CMA decision “disproportionate, irrational and inconsistent with the evidence,”UK regulators took the view that Microsoft’s dominance in cloud gaming doesn’t just apply to Game Pass. They cited the company’s network of software, infrastructure and services — ranging from the Xbox console and dozens of game studios to the Windows PC operating system and global chain of data centers.Although Sony leads in console sales, the CMA decided Microsoft’s ecosystem gives it early dominance in cloud gaming. And the agency concluded the company’s recent deals to work with other cloud gaming providers fall short of addressing its concerns.Agency officials have said for at least a year that they would rather err on the side of over-enforcement, since deals are tough to unwind after the fact.Analysts have speculated that cloud gaming could one day compete with console gaming because of the high price of both developing and purchasing gaming consoles.“Cloud gaming remains very much a nascent market, so a decision to block is looking quite far into the future,” said Vili Lehdonvirta, a professor of economic sociology and digital social research at the University of Oxford. “Of course we have existing examples where tech giants have used their dominance in one market to capture another market that’s emerged.”The decision means both companies will have to get more serious about planning a future without the other. Microsoft, for example, has expressed interest in launching a store for mobile games, where Activision’s King division is a big player with titles like Candy Crush.(Corrects spelling of Joost Rietveld in eighteenth paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekHow a Dishwasher Engineer Challenged Elon Musk’s Grip on Commercial SpaceTwitter’s Unpaid Bills Threaten to Be an Even Bigger Problem for Elon MuskToo Big to Fail, But Not Too Big to Bail Out Other BanksThe Company Behind Ben Shapiro Is Trying to Build a Right-Wing Magic KingdomCadillac’s Lyriq EV Might Be a Winner If GM Can Build Enough of Them©2023 Bloomberg L.P.","April 27, 2023 at 9:46 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-69-billion-deal-tripped-192015703.html,Bloomberg,0.0,0.0,0.017076917456664304,0.39940681681188
ATVI,"UK watchdog used as tool by Bidens anti-tech administration, Activision claims","Bobby Kotick, chief executive of Activision Blizzard, alleged that Lina Khan, Biden’s appointed head of the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC), had met British officials days before the gaming giant’s merger with Microsoft was blocked.Mr Smith said: “There's a clear message here – the European Union is a more attractive place to start a business than the United Kingdom.”Sony, which makes the PlayStation console, had claimed Xbox-designer Microsoft would use the merger to restrict access to the popular game.Mr Kotick, meanwhile, suggested to CNBC that Democrat officials had leaned on their UK counterparts to advance an ideological attack on Big Tech, though he admitted he did not know what exactly was discussed.The Activision Blizzard boss said on Thursday: “I was surprised to learn that Lina Khan and the head of the CMA had a meeting a week and a half ago in Washington.“What you're seeing now is that the CMA is being used as a tool by the FTC to create these kinds of outcomes.”Mr Kotick added: “Ideology shouldn't play a role in the functioning of the FTC... we're handcuffing American companies. That isn't going to serve the interest of America.”Douglas Farrar, an FTC spokesman, said: “The FTC regularly and lawfully cooperates with international partners and has for decades under both Republican and Democratic Chairs, a practice long welcomed by the business community.“But we never outsource our authority. The FTC absolutely did not collude with the CMA or any other international regulator on any proposed merger review. When a deal appears blatantly anticompetitive then independent antitrust regulators can simply make their own judgements.”The CMA declined to comment.Ms Khan, the 34-year-old chair of the FTC, has been a vocal critic of the monopoly-like power of some Big Tech giants.Critics, however, have accused the chair of engaging in “hipster antitrust”.Insiders at Microsoft's Redmond headquarters are understood to have been stunned by the CMA's decision.Senior sources said the tech giant had offered “legally binding commitments... not empty promises” to mitigate concerns around the deal.He added: “People are shocked, people are disappointed, and people's confidence in technology in the UK has been severely shaken.”The watchdog’s ruling came just hours after No 10 hosted Britain’s gaming industry in an effort to showcase its work in the sector.The CMA said: “It is the CMA's job to do what is best for the people, businesses and economy of the UK, not merging firms with commercial interests.”Microsoft and Activision have vowed to appeal the decision.The deal still faces an investigation in the EU while US authorities, led by Ms Khan, have launched a legal bid to block the merger.Additional reporting by Gareth Corfield","April 27, 2023 at 12:25 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/uk-watchdog-used-tool-biden-172546009.html,The Telegraph,0.0,0.0,0.07671568627450984,0.39953135100193926

ATVI,Big Tech Has Formidable Foe in Britains Antitrust Watchdog After Microsoft Blow,"(Bloomberg) -- The UK’s surprise decision to stop the Microsoft Corp. $69 billion Activision Blizzard Inc. deal in its tracks shows a more muscular approach to deal enforcement that’s come into its own since Brexit.Most Read from BloombergChina Takes the Yuan Global in Bid to Repel a Weaponized DollarZelenskiy Denies Ukraine Sent Drones to Hit Putin, KremlinTD, First Horizon End $13 Billion Merger as Regulators StallPacWest Is Weighing Strategic Options, Including Possible SaleBank Drama Rages On; Apple Climbs in Late Trading: Markets WrapThe final ruling deals a blow to Microsoft’s chances of securing the world’s biggest gaming takeover and puts the Competition and Markets Authority at the center of global antitrust alongside the US and the EU. Wednesday’s decision is globally binding and the road to approval looks to be hard slog.“The Microsoft-Activision decision is another clear example of the CMA establishing itself firmly as one of the most important competition enforcers on the world stage in the post-Brexit world,” Pinar Akman, a competition professor at the University of Leeds, said.It’s the second, but by far the biggest, Big Tech tie-up that the CMA has blocked after ending Meta Platforms Inc. chances of buying GIF search engine Giphy. These decisions have cut across criticism that it hasn’t done enough in the past to get to grips with nascent tech industries being snapped up by a handful of major players. Failings that may have led to Meta’s takeover of Whatsapp and Instagram.In another show of post-Brexit strength, this week the UK introduced new laws to parliament that will further boost its powers to clamp down on tech dominance and help benefit the country’s consumers. It includes new digital competition rules and regulations that will designate a handful of tech companies as having “strategic market status.”“Preventing the development of entrenched market power in the first place is the most effective way to safeguard competition,” Sarah Cardell, the CMA’s chief executive officer, said on Wednesday. “Merger control therefore has a critical role to play in driving productivity and growth in the UK.”Oxford University-educated Cardell is the first woman to ever run the UK’s watchdog since she took over the role in December. Three women are now the faces of global antitrust with Lina Khan’s US Federal Trade Commission and Margrethe Vestager at the European Commission.The CMA’s confidence in its mergers system has drawn criticism that the agency has become too interventionist and may put off international businesses. Leaders at both Microsoft and Activision blasted the decision on Wednesday as being bad for business and investment in the UK.Closed for Business“The CMA’s report contradicts the ambitions of the UK to become an attractive country to build technology businesses,” an Activision spokesperson said. “Global innovators large and small will take note that - despite all its rhetoric - the UK is clearly closed for business.”Analysis from law firm Linklaters shows that of the deals subject to an in-depth probe, 64% have failed over the last three-and-a-half years compared with 34% of deals scrutinized by the CMA between 2014 and 2017.Cardell, a former competition partner at elite London firm Slaughter and May, deflected the criticism arguing that the idea the agency is too interventionist is misplaced and it’s just doing its job to protect the UK. She said that of the 12 to 14 deals that are referred to an in-depth probe from hundreds annually, only a handful of those are blocked.For now, all eyes turn to what the European Commission will do next month and how Microsoft defends itself before the UK’s Competition Appeal Tribunal — a fight that will take many months to resolve. The CAT also rarely rules against the watchdog in merger probe reviews.“The CMA is taking on a leadership role in Big Tech merger control,” Anne Witt, a law professor at the EDHEC Business School, said. “If the CMA wins this, it will create precedent and the message to the Big Tech industry will be clear — times are changing and the days of unconstrained acquisition sprees are over.”(Updates with biography details of CMA’s Sarah Cardell in the sixth and 11th paragraphs)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekTwitter’s Unpaid Bills Threaten to Be an Even Bigger Problem for Elon MuskHow a Dishwasher Engineer Challenged Elon Musk’s Grip on Commercial SpaceToo Big to Fail, But Not Too Big to Bail Out Other BanksThe Company Behind Ben Shapiro Is Trying to Build a Right-Wing Magic KingdomCadillac’s Lyriq EV Might Be a Winner If GM Can Build Enough of Them©2023 Bloomberg L.P.","April 27, 2023 at 6:35 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/big-tech-formidable-foe-britain-060000022.html,Bloomberg,0.0,0.1,0.030755583554091026,0.39591867502315264

""We will continue to engage proactively with Microsoft and other companies.""Smith said Microsoft had worked effectively with regulators in Brussels but not in London, which he said refuted Britain's claim that it would be more flexible after Brexit.The company had answered the CMA's questions, he said, and it had told them to come back with any more concerns. ""They went silent, we heard nothing from them,"" he said.""There's a clear message here - the European Union is a more attractive place to start a business if you want some day to sell it than the United Kingdom,"" he added.But CMA Chief Executive Sarah Cardell said the regulator's role was to make sure Britain was a competitive environment for businesses to be able to grow and thrive.""The decision that the CMA takes is an independent decision that we reached looking at an overall assessment of the impact of the deal on competition, and we think that is the right decision for the UK,"" she said.She noted the U.S. Federal Trade Commission was also pressing for the deal to be blocked on competition grounds.Microsoft said yesterday it would appeal, with ""aggressive"" support from Activision.Appeals against CMA rulings are heard by the Competition Appeals Tribunal, which makes a judgment on the merits of the decision.

ATVI,Microsoft Stock Soars After UK Regulators Block Activision Deal,"In January 2022, when Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) first announced it had struck a deal worth $69 billion to acquire popular video game developer Activision Blizzard Inc. (NASDAQ:ATVI), investors applauded the news. It seemed like a perfect way to utilize Microsofts $104 billion cash hoard, as it would strengthen the company's already significant position in the gaming industry and help reduce competition.MSFT 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of MSFTPeter Lynch Chart of MSFTThe first regulatory hurdle to the deal came on Dec. 8, 2022, when the U.S. Federal Trade Commission sued to block Microsoft and Activisions combination. The markets did not have much of a reaction to the development at all, and Microsofts shares rose just 1% that day, which is well within the realm of normal daily fluctuations.However, it appears that investor sentiment may have changed since then. On April 26, when the U.K. Competition and Markets Authority voted to block the deal on anti-competitive grounds, Microsoft shares soared more than 7%, even as Activision was down 11%.Just what was it that changed investors outlook on Microsoft and Activision to the point where optimism for Microsoft soared following a major blow to what could have been a blockbuster value-accretive deal?For one, some investors were already certain that regulators would succeed in blocking the deal and had factored that into their valuations, so they may have been discounting Microsoft as a result. Another thing to consider is that, as the economic outlook in general and Activisions outlook in particular have worsened, fears began to crop up that Microsoft might be over-paying. Lastly, but perhaps most importantly, Microsoft had reported positive earnings results the previous morning, so there may have been some leftover trading enthusiasm from that, even though the share price did drop the day of the earnings report.Regulatory opposition was not unexpectedFrom the moment Microsoft declared its intention to acquire Activision, it was clear there would likely be some form of opposition from regulators. In addition to being the third-largest maker of game consoles with its Xbox, Microsoft also dominates the PC gaming market and is buying its way into mobile games. Microsoft even has 23 in-house game development studios for Xbox, PC and mobile.The gaming community was quick to point out that Microsoft would have both the means and the incentive to make Activisions games lower quality on competitors platforms. Microsoft tried to placate gamers and regulators by promising not to take such actions, but the fact remains that even if it signed contracts to that effect, those contracts would expire and new games would be developed that the contracts did not cover.Thus, some investors may have taken a cautious approach on Microsoft due to fears that a regulatory block on the Activision deal could hurt the share price. That may be why the first regulatory blow did not move the stock much, and the second blow validated the view that the deal would likely be successfully blocked in the end, though nothing is set in stone yet.Pressured earnings lower Activisions perceived valueEven if a good chunk of investors were just waiting for the Activision acquisition to be blocked, why did that become such a positive development for Microsoft in the markets eyes? To help answer this question, lets take a look at Activisions quarterly revenue and earnings per share numbers:As we can see, Activisions earnings per share are down since the acquisition was announced, though revenue per share has grown. There is a general expectation that people are likely to spend less money on games when the economy is struggling, which is hurting Activisions outlook as fears arise that Microsoft may be paying too high of a price tag.Additionally, even Microsofts fortress-like balance sheet would take a hit from a $69 billion all-cash acquisition. Its strong balance sheet has always worked in Microsofts favor, so why would it put that in jeopardy, especially in a rising interest rate environment?Did positive earnings play a role?There is also a chance that Microsofts positive earnings report from the day before impacted the April 26 price movement. For its third quarter of fiscal 2023, the company reported revenue was up 7% year over year while earnings per share grew 10%, both beating analysts expectations.Microsofts share price actually dropped slightly during normal trading hours on earnings day, but it spiked sharply in after-hours trading. The U.K. is five hours ahead of New York time, so it is actually difficult to discern whether the price spike was due to the regulatory announcement, a vast amount of in-the-money options being automatically exercised at the markets closing price (as is always a danger with a heavily-traded stock like Microsoft) or a combination of the two.Will the deal really be blocked?Despite regulatory pushback, Microsoft is one of the most powerful publicly traded companies in the world, so it is possible the Activision deal may go through after all. The company has already shown it is willing to go to lengths such as a decade-long contract with Samsung Electronics (XKRX:005930) to make Call of Duty releases available on the same day for PlayStation and Xbox. It will probably take a lot more than that to satisfy regulators, but if Microsoft is willing to make enough concessions, it might have a chance.Overall, I do not think it matters one way or another for Microsofts long-term results. Anti-competitive acquisitions can sometimes be less valuable than anticipated because they essentially boil down to paying money for a development that slows down overall industry growth, which extends the break-even timeline.","April 26, 2023 at 4:41 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-stock-soars-uk-regulators-214116015.html,GuruFocus.com,0.0,0.0,0.12132113257113261,0.4731781181781183

That means the market currently prices in zero to low probability the deal will close.The UK Competition and Markets Authority isn’t alone in disputing the takeover bid. The US Federal Trade Commission has already sued to block, and it still needs clearance from the European Commission and China. The deal’s closing deadline is July 18.Read: Microsoft’s $69 Billion Activision Deal Blocked by UKAntitrust scrutiny is seen as a major regulatory hurdle for Microsoft’s takeover. In March, the UK narrowed the scope of its probe, lifting traders’ optimism and sending the deal spread to its lowest since the merger announcement.The deal has been the center of attention for the merger arbitrage community since it was announced in January 2022. It is the largest pending transaction in the US, standing out at a time when traders have been facing a market stuck in the doldrums, with mostly smaller and private equity deals announced this year.Investors are now shifting focus to Activision’s standalone value.

ATVI,Explainer: Is Microsoft still buying Activision Blizzard?,"It's not “game over” yet for Microsoft's quest to buy the video game maker Activision Blizzard, but the software giant is starting to run out of clear pathways to complete its $69 billion takeover.It's been more than 15 months since Microsoft, owner of the Xbox gaming system, first revealed its plans to buy the publisher of popular game franchises like Call of Duty, World of Warcraft and Candy Crush. But there's no end in sight.HOW MANY LIVES LEFT?The deal awaits an important May decision from antitrust regulators representing the 27-nation European Union. It must also undergo an August trial in the U.S. before an administrative judge at the Federal Trade Commission. But a former FTC official says the U.K. decision could be a deal-breaker, especially if the appeals tribunal follows its “very deferential” approach to the regulator.“If this were a smaller jurisdiction with a tiny population, the companies could shrug and say, ‘We just won’t do business there,’” said former FTC Chair William Kovacic. “They can’t do that very effectively with the United Kingdom. So a U.K. decision to block is basically a global decision to block the transaction.”WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR GAMERS?Nothing for now. But even if Microsoft is able to complete the purchase, the average gamer is not going to notice immediate changes.Harder to assess are the long-term effects on the games that get made and how people can play them, said Liam Deane, a game industry analyst at Omdia. That's part of what antitrust enforcers around the world have spent the past year investigating.Microsoft had promised to keep popular titles like Call of Duty on rival platforms like Sony's PlayStation and Nintendo for at least a decade, but future Activision Blizzard games could be exclusive to Xbox.“Down the line, it would have quite a big impact,” Deane said. “Activision is a big publisher, it has a big market share” and that could affect the “relative strength of the different console platforms.”HAVE OTHER COUNTRIES APPROVED IT?Yes, the deal won approval March 28 in Japan, a hub for game development and the home of both Sony and Nintendo. It's also been approved in Brazil, South Africa and some smaller markets.WHY DID U.K. BLOCK IT?It was the small but growing cloud gaming market, not the existing console rivalry between Xbox and Sony, that the Competition and Markets Authority said it was concerned about.Streaming games to tablets, phones and other devices has freed players from buying expensive consoles and gaming computers.“What the CMA said, essentially, is that in cloud gaming Microsoft is the market leader,"" Deane said. ""And even though that is a smaller market, it’s one that’s at a critical stage where it’s just starting to take off and potentially that is going to become a huge platform in the future. And therefore it would be a risk to competition to strengthen Microsoft’s position in that market where they’re already leading.”The watchdog said it reviewed Microsoft’s proposed remedies but found they would require its oversight, whereas preventing the merger would allow cloud gaming to develop without intervention.—-AP writer Kelvin Chan in London contributed to this report.","April 26, 2023 at 3:04 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/explainer-microsoft-still-buying-activision-200433041.html,AP Finance,0.0,0.0,0.027238888888888906,0.43136111111111114
ATVI,Britain accused of being closed for business after blocking £55bn Microsoft mega merger,"One of the world's biggest companies has claimed that Britain is “closed for business” after a £55 billion merger was blocked by the competition watchdog.Activision – the video game publisher behind the Call of Duty franchise – warned that blocking the deal threatened Chancellor Jeremy Hunt’s ambitions to make the UK the next Silicon Valley.After a nine-month investigation, the CMA said on Wednesday that Microsoft’s $69 billion (£55 billion) acquisition of Activision risked endangering competition and could lead to higher prices for video game players.Activision, whose market value fell by £6.5 billion after the decision was announced, said: “The CMA’s report contradicts the ambitions of the UK to become an attractive country to build technology businesses.“We will work aggressively with Microsoft to reverse this on appeal. The report’s conclusions are a disservice to UK citizens, who face increasingly dire economic prospects.“We will reassess our growth plans for the UK. Global innovators large and small will take note that – despite all its rhetoric – the UK is clearly closed for business.”Britain is the company’s biggest employment hub outside the US and its chief executive Bobby Kotick has previously said the UK would be a key location for plans to hire up to 5,000 staff globally.European regulators have yet to rule on whether the deal can go ahead and US authorities face a legal battle to block it. However, the UK's verdict alone is enough to stop it happening.Mr Kotick told staff: “If the CMA’s decision holds, it would stifle investment, competition, and job creation throughout the UK gaming industry.”Microsoft, which employs around 6,000 workers in the UK, said it would appeal the decision. Its president Brad Smith said: ""The CMA’s decision rejects a pragmatic path to address competition concerns and discourages technology innovation and investment in the United Kingdom.""The deal was blocked by a panel of CMA experts chaired by Martin Coleman, who was the leader of London’s Brent Council in the 1980s and a one-time Labour parliamentary candidate.A person close to the deal said “his background certainly seems relevant”, although it is understood he has not been a member of any political party for over 30 years.Mr Coleman said “it is vital that we protect competition” in the video game market. Rivals had feared that Microsoft, which makes the Xbox console, buying Activision would lead to less choice for gamers who play on other consoles and game streaming services.The CMA defended its position. In a joint statement from its chairman Marcus Bokkerink and chief executive Sarah Cardell, it said: “Merger control… has a critical role to play in driving productivity and growth in the UK, including in rapidly evolving digital markets.”He wrote in the Evening Standard: “The scrapping of tax-free shopping for international visitors only holds London back further. Meanwhile other cities are beginning to thrive again.”John Holland-Kaye, the boss of Heathrow, said the Government should reinstate tax-free shopping to take advantage of a flood of Chinese tourists descending on Europe as Beijing backtracks on zero-Covid travel restrictions.Mr Holland-Kaye said: ""We are building our route network to connect all of Britain to the growing markets of the world – now we need the government to lure international visitors back to the UK by scrapping the ‘tourist tax’.""Britain is facing wider questions about its status as a hub for big tech. The British microchip maker Arm is to float its shares in New York instead of the City, and Instagram told staff last week that it was effectively shutting down most of its UK operation.","April 26, 2023 at 3:11 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tech-giants-claim-britain-closed-140513346.html,The Telegraph,-0.1,0.1,0.009908050605725024,0.33124265914963597

ATVI,Blocked Microsoft-Activision deal could 'remove potential M&A premium on large publishers': Analyst,"Oppenheimer Senior Analyst of Emerging Technologies & Services Martin Yang joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss how U.K. regulators opting to block Microsoft's Activision Blizzard acquisition deal could impact the M&A environment in the gaming industry.martin it's good to see you here. So you cover Activision. What do you make just on the impact to Activision that this block over from the UK regulators is going to have on the company? And is the deal now dead?So that puts Microsoft and Activision in a very tough spot, whereas the prior argument regarding ""Call of Duty"" and other games' exclusivity, that problem can be solved very easily with behavior remedies, such as Microsoft's promise to put those games available on other platforms on a 10 year deal. So UKCMA is taking this different approach that puts Microsoft in a much tougher spot to offer a effective rebuttal.But Microsoft will be-- I think will be willing to maybe make the access or the initial purchase of the game more flexible. So the key question is Microsoft, on paper, does have an overwhelming advantage in terms of cloud gaming. And there will be no way for them to prove to UKCMA that other competing platforms can have similar access in terms of infrastructure and the player base. So even though they can make some changes, but I don't think those changes will be enough to make CMA satisfied.So that will be a multiple year earnings driver for Activision that are not completely captured by consensus just yet.","April 26, 2023 at 2:26 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/blocked-microsoft-activision-deal-could-192626269.html,Yahoo Finance Video,0.10714285714285714,0.7142857142857143,0.07163089225589225,0.5281250000000001
ATVI,U.K. regulators block Microsoft's $69 billion acquisition of Activision,"Yahoo Finance tech editor Dan Howley joins the Live show to report on a decision by regulators in the United Kingdom to block Microsoft's planned acquisition of Activision Blizzard.Basically, this deal has three main parts. Activision Blizzard makes ""Call of Duty."" they publish ""Call of Duty,"" rather. That game itself made $1 billion 10 days after release. That's a lot of money from one title, absolutely massive. Microsoft clearly wants that to be under its wing.The other is the cloud gaming aspect of it. And that's where you're able to take low-power devices-- if you have a Samsung Smart TV from like the last five years, I think, you can get Microsoft's cloud gaming built directly into it it, just download it. You can play on your smartphone, your tablet stuff.That would normally cost you a $500 console, major PC to play, you can do that on a low-power device. That's the cloud gaming aspect. Microsoft wants Activision Blizzard and its titles to be a juggernaut in this space.By the way, they're already crushing Sony. The third part though, is the mobile gaming aspect. And I think that's one of the underrated areas that people aren't necessarily talking about but should. Mobile gaming is the fastest-growing segment of gaming in the world Microsoft. Wants that foothold.Activision Blizzard has King. King makes ""Candy Crush,"" which just annihilates as far as how much money it brings in for this little game on a smartphone. I'm going to have to talk to Activision Blizzard about my mom.And so because they have smartphones, they can get a bigger audience connected there. And so Microsoft can jump into that. So it's three parts.Everyone's focusing on the ""Call of Duty"" aspect. Cloud gaming and mobile are really where it's at.This was going to put them in the number three spot gaming worldwide behind Tencent and Sony. It would have made them a genuine competitor to Sony. Sony still puts out its own games. I have Microsoft Game Pass. I have an Xbox and a PlayStation.Sony just-- they put out better first party games. And Microsoft can't do that. They're trying to. This would have done that for them. I don't think they would have cut off Sony because they would be cutting off their nose to spite their face just because they wouldn't be able to sell to as broad of an audience.So I do think that for investors, for Microsoft, this isn't the broader story. It could have been if the deal had been approved or, eventually, if it does go forward.","April 26, 2023 at 2:20 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/u-k-regulators-block-microsofts-192015926.html,Yahoo Finance Video,0.0,0.0,0.08218175054112553,0.4926153273809524

ATVI,Intervention on Microsoft makes the UK look stronger,"It is probably the biggest intervention that Britain’s competition policeman has ever made, and predictably it has drawn a furious response from the two companies at the centre of it.In a borderline unhinged outburst, Activision Blizzard claimed that the Competition and Markets Authority’s move was proof that Britain is “closed for business”.It went on to say that it “contradicts the ambitions of the UK to become an attractive country to build technology businesses” and labelled the decision a “disservice to UK citizens, who face increasingly dire economic prospects”.As if that wasn’t enough, Microsoft executive Brad Smith weighed in with his own theatrics, warning that the ruling “discourages technology innovation and investment in the United Kingdom”.They can all put their toys back in the pram. In fact, it shows the opposite. What it really demonstrates is that Britain is becoming more assertive on the world stage. One of the more clear-cut benefits of Brexit was that it freed us from the interference of others in areas as important as competition policy.Outside of the EU, we are now free to make our own decisions without the fear of upsetting Brussels, which is precisely what has happened.The CMA deserves credit for showing courage, as well as standing up for Britain’s interests. It shows that we have a regulator more willing to put the needs of consumers before the sort of big, foreign technology companies that most people would surely argue already wield far too much influence already.There is nothing to be gained from allowing America’s tech giants from holding us to ransom. On the contrary, there has long been a consensus that the consequences of letting these sprawling companies become even more powerful would be dire.It is important that we stand up to them and show that they can’t be handed free rein to swoop in and buy whatever they want. The UK has a thriving computer games industry but for too long we’ve allowed UK technology to be picked off by bigger, more assertive overseas rivals.This is a statement of intent that big companies can’t just ruthlessly crush competition in a single-minded quest for dominance. Nor should we be cowed by the threat to cut jobs and hold back on future investment. It’s a petulant response to not being allowed their own way.What it shows is that we have a robust, independent regulator, which is welcome – and ultimately should make Britain more attractive, not less.","April 26, 2023 at 12:54 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intervention-microsoft-makes-uk-look-175419238.html,The Telegraph,0.0,0.0,0.2432170542635659,0.5565245478036175

ATVI,UK Blocks Microsofts $69 Billion Activision Deal,"(Bloomberg) -- Microsoft Corp.’s $69 billion takeover of Activision Blizzard Inc. was vetoed by Britain’s antitrust watchdog, in a potentially fatal blow for the gaming industry’s biggest ever deal.Most Read from BloombergTesla Drops Model Y Starting Price Below the Average US VehicleUK Blocks Microsoft’s $69 Billion Activision Deal Quants Are ‘Out of Ammo’ for Buying Stocks, Goldman WarnsNetflix Spain Lost 1 Million Users Last Quarter, Kantar SaysFirst Republic Bank to Weigh Up to $100 Billion in Asset SalesThe Competition and Markets Authority said its concerns couldn’t be solved by remedies such as the sale of blockbuster title Call of Duty or other solutions involving promises to permit rivals to offer the game on their platforms, according to a statement Wednesday. Microsoft said it will appeal the decision.Pressure had been mounting on Microsoft as it lobbies at home and in Europe to convince watchdogs to clear the deal — one of the 30 biggest acquisitions of all time. Crucially, the CMA’s conclusions comes before decisions from the European Union and the US Federal Trade Commission, which is waiting on a hearing in the summer after formally suing to veto the transaction.Microsoft gained 7% to $294.82 at 9:58 a.m. in New York, while Activision was down 8.8% to $79.11. If the deal is eventually blocked, Microsoft could be on the hook for a break up fee of as much as $3 billion.“Microsoft already enjoys a powerful position and head start over other competitors in cloud gaming and this deal would strengthen that advantage giving it the ability to undermine new and innovative competitors,” Martin Coleman, chair of the independent panel of experts conducting this investigation, said.The CMA took a view that the merger could result in higher prices, fewer choices and less innovation for UK gamers. However, earlier this month it narrowed its original scope to focus on cloud gaming rather than consoles, after weighing new evidence.“We remain fully committed to this acquisition and will appeal,” Brad Smith, vice chair and president of Microsoft, said. “The CMA’s decision rejects a pragmatic path to address competition concerns and discourages technology innovation and investment in the UK.”Microsoft had been fighting the regulatory battle in the UK and Europe with an eye-catching road show of Brussels press conferences and full page advertisements in British newspapers to try to influence sentiment on the deal.The CMA said the deal would solidify Microsoft’s advantage in the market by giving it control over Call of Duty, Overwatch, and World of Warcraft titles. The watchdog found that without the merger Activision would be able to start providing games on cloud platforms in the future.The Call of Duty’s latest installment, Modern Warfare II, released in October and topped $1 billion in sales within 10 days. It became the best-selling game of 2022, according to industry researcher NPD Group.‘Good for Competition’“We’ve already begun the work to appeal to the UK Competition Appeals Tribunal. We’re confident in our case because the facts are on our side, this deal is good for competition,” Bobby Kotick, Activision’s chief executive officer, in a note to employees.Britain’s competition watchdog said any potential remedy would need some degree of regulatory oversight and it is typically against behavioral remedies.The regulator has attempted to assert itself as a powerful global regulator since the country left the EU. In recent shows of strength, it’s taken on Big Tech, including ordering Meta Platforms Inc. to reverse its acquisition of Giphy after worries it could take a stranglehold of the GIF market.“Essentially, there has never been a successful appeal in the UK on an antitrust decision,” said Aaron Glick, a merger arbitrage strategist at TD Cowen. “There does not appear to be a path forward for Microsoft.”The European Commission is still due to issue the final word on its own probe into the deal on May 22, while the FTC has scheduled a hearing into the deal in August.--With assistance from Amy Thomson, Cecilia D'Anastasio, Yiqin Shen and Molly Schuetz.(Updates with share prices in the fourth paragraph)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekMusk Bets the House of Tesla on Low Prices and Razor-Thin MarginsCarvana Was Built for Low Interest Rates.

Every one of our key intellectual properties continues to grow year-over-year, with Call of Duty once again a key driver of growth. Mobile net bookings grew double digits including another record quarter for King. Pre-sales for Diablo IV are strong. And none of this would be possible without our people, who deliver excellence for our players every single day. We remain confident that our deal with Microsoft benefits competition, consumers, and job creation in markets around the world, especially in the UK. The CMA’s report today does not reflect these realities, and we will work aggressively with Microsoft to reverse it on appeal.""Financial MetricsQ1(in millions, except EPS)20232022GAAP Net Revenues$2,383$1,768$(528)$(287)GAAP EPS$0.93$0.50Non-GAAP EPS$1.09$0.64$(0.49)$(0.26)Please refer to the tables at the back of this earnings release for a reconciliation of the company’s GAAP and non-GAAP results.For the quarter ended March 31, 2023, Activision Blizzard’s net revenues presented in accordance with GAAP were $2.38 billion, as compared with $1.77 billion for the first quarter of 2022. GAAP net revenues from digital channels were $2.16 billion. GAAP operating margin was 34%. GAAP earnings per diluted share was $0.93, as compared with $0.50 for the first quarter of 2022. On a non-GAAP basis, Activision Blizzard’s operating margin was 40% and earnings per diluted share was $1.09, as compared with $0.64 for the first quarter of 2022.Activision Blizzard generated $577 million in operating cash flow for the quarter as compared with $642 million for the first quarter of 2022.Please refer to the tables at the back of this press release for a reconciliation of the company’s GAAP and non-GAAP results.Operating MetricsMicrosoft TransactionAs announced on January 18, 2022, Microsoft plans to acquire Activision Blizzard for $95.00 per share in an all-cash transaction. The transaction has been approved by the boards of directors of both Activision Blizzard and Microsoft and by Activision Blizzard’s stockholders.On April 26, 2023, the United Kingdom Competition and Markets Authority (""CMA"") announced a decision to block the merger, stating that competition concerns arose in relation to cloud gaming and that Microsoft’s remedies addressing any concerns in cloud gaming were not sufficient. Activision Blizzard considers that the CMA’s decision is disproportionate, irrational and inconsistent with the evidence. Microsoft has announced its decision to appeal the CMA’s ruling, and Activision Blizzard intends to fully support Microsoft’s efforts on this appeal. Activision Blizzard continues to believe that the deal is pro-competitive, will bring Activision Blizzard content to more gamers, and will result in substantial benefits to consumers and developers in the UK and globally. The parties continue to fully engage with other regulators reviewing the transaction to obtain any required regulatory approvals.Conference Call and Earnings PresentationIn light of the proposed transaction with Microsoft, and as is customary during the pendency of an acquisition, Activision Blizzard will not be hosting a conference call, issuing an earnings presentation, or providing detailed quantitative financial guidance in conjunction with its first quarter 2023 earnings release. For further detail and discussion of our financial performance, please refer to Activision Blizzard's upcoming Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2023.Selected Business HighlightsActivision Blizzard continued to connect and engage the world through epic entertainment in the first quarter. Our talented teams are focused on delighting our communities and expanding our fully-owned intellectual properties across platforms, geographies and business models. Execution against our focused strategy fueled 25% growth in net bookings, approximately 70% growth in GAAP operating income, and approximately 30% growth in segment operating income, in each case on a year-over-year basis.Our robust product pipeline, live game opportunity, and focus on operational discipline continue to create a foundation for strong financial performance for the full year. We remain cognizant of risks, including those related to our execution, economic conditions, the labor market and exchange rates, as well as headwinds for our professional esports business model. Nonetheless, we continue to expect at least high-teens year-over-year growth for GAAP revenue in 2023, and at least high-single digit year-over-year growth in net bookings and total segment operating income for the year.ActivisionBlizzardKingAmid a weak macro environment for digital advertising, King advertising revenue fell due to declines in business with partner networks. King continues to invest in innovative ad product offerings to fuel further growth in its direct business with brand advertisers.King is already starting to see benefits from last June’s acquisition of Peltarion, an AI company. Peltarion’s technology is helping King to accelerate the production and testing of live operations and to offer more relevant game content to players, with the acquisition set to deliver a meaningful financial benefit in its first full year.Balance SheetActivision Blizzard Disclosure Channels to Disseminate InformationAbout Activision BlizzardOur mission, to connect and engage the world through epic entertainment, has never been more important. Through communities rooted in our video games we enable hundreds of millions of people to experience joy, thrill and achievement. We enable social connections through the lens of fun, and we foster purpose and a sense of accomplishment through healthy competition. Like sport, but with greater accessibility, our players can find purpose and meaning through competitive gaming. Video games, unlike any other social or entertainment media, have the ability to break down the barriers that can inhibit tolerance and understanding. Celebrating differences is at the core of our culture and ensures we can create games for players of diverse backgrounds in the 190 countries our games are played.As a member of the Fortune 500 and as a component company of the S&P 500, we have an extraordinary track record of delivering superior shareholder returns for over 30 years. Our sustained success has enabled the company to support corporate social responsibility initiatives that are directly tied to our games. As an example, our Call of Duty Endowment has helped find employment for over 100,000 veterans.Total net bookings increased by 25% year-over-year for the first quarter of 2023. On a constant currency basis, total net bookings increased 29% year-over-year for the first quarter of 2023 as currency rate changes negatively impacted year-over-year growth in the quarter by 4 percentage points.Activision segment net revenues grew by 28% year-over-year, Blizzard segment net revenues grew by 62%, and King segment net revenues grew by 8% for the first quarter of 2023. On a constant currency year-over-year basis, Activision segment net revenue grew 30%, Blizzard segment net revenue grew 67%, and King segment net revenue grew 11% for the first quarter of 2023, as currency rate changes negatively impacted Activision segment net revenue year-over-growth by 2 percentage points, Blizzard segment net revenue year-over-growth by 5 percentage points, and King segment net revenue year-over-growth by 3 percentage points.Activision Blizzard provides net income (loss), earnings (loss) per share, and operating margin data and guidance both including (in accordance with GAAP) and excluding (non-GAAP) certain items. When relevant, the company also provides constant currency information to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations. In addition, Activision Blizzard provides EBITDA (defined as GAAP net income (loss) before interest (income) expense, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization) and adjusted EBITDA (defined as non-GAAP operating margin (see non-GAAP financial measure below) before depreciation). The non-GAAP financial measures exclude the following items, as applicable in any given reporting period and our outlook:expenses related to share-based compensation, including liability awards accounted for under ASC 718;the amortization of intangibles from purchase price accounting;fees and other expenses related to mergers and acquisitions, including related debt financings, and refinancing of long-term debt, including penalties and the write off of unamortized discount and deferred financing costs;restructuring and related charges;expenses related to the wind down of our partnership with NetEase in China in regards to licenses covering the publication of several Blizzard titles which expired in January 2023;other non-cash charges from reclassification of certain cumulative translation adjustments into earnings as required by GAAP;the income tax adjustments associated with any of the above items (tax impact on non-GAAP pre-tax income is calculated under the same accounting principles applied to the GAAP pre-tax income under ASC 740, which employs an annual effective tax rate method to the results); andsignificant discrete tax-related items, including amounts related to changes in tax laws, amounts related to the potential or final resolution of tax positions, and other unusual or unique tax-related items and activities.In the future, Activision Blizzard may also consider whether other items should also be excluded in calculating the non-GAAP financial measures used by the company. Management believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides investors with additional useful information to measure Activision Blizzard’s financial and operating performance. In particular, the measures facilitate comparison of operating performance between periods and help investors to better understand the operating results of Activision Blizzard by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of the company’s core business, operating results, or future outlook. Additionally, we consider quantitative and qualitative factors in assessing whether to adjust for the impact of items that may be significant or that could affect an understanding of our ongoing financial and business performance or trends. Internally, management uses these non-GAAP financial measures, along with others, in assessing the company’s operating results, and measuring compliance with the requirements of the company’s debt financing agreements, as well as in planning and forecasting.Activision Blizzard’s non-GAAP financial measures are not based on a comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles, and the terms non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP earnings per share, non-GAAP operating margin, and non-GAAP or adjusted EBITDA do not have a standardized meaning. Therefore, other companies may use the same or similarly named measures, but exclude different items, which may not provide investors a comparable view of Activision Blizzard’s performance in relation to other companies.Management compensates for the limitations resulting from the exclusion of these items by considering the impact of the items separately and by considering Activision Blizzard’s GAAP, as well as non-GAAP, results and outlook, and by presenting the most comparable GAAP measures directly ahead of non-GAAP measures, and by providing a reconciliation that indicates and describes the adjustments made.We caution that a number of important factors, many of which are beyond our control, could cause our actual future results and other future circumstances to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements. Such factors include, but are not limited to: the risk that the proposed transaction with Microsoft may not be completed in a timely manner or at all, which may adversely affect our business and the price of our common stock;

ATVI,"UK blocks Microsoft-Activision gaming deal, biggest in tech","The Competition and Markets Authority said in its final report that “the only effective remedy” to the substantial loss of competition “is to prohibit the Merger.” The companies have vowed to appeal.The U.K. watchdog's decision “came as a surprise to most people” and heightens global uncertainty over the deal, said Liam Deane, a game industry analyst for research firm Omdia.“It’s a big enough market to throw a pretty serious spanner in the works from Microsoft and Activision’s perspective, but things will get a lot worse if they also get the wrong decision from the European Commission in a few weeks time,” he said.The U.K. watchdog’s concerns centered on how the deal would affect cloud gaming, which streams to tablets, phones and other devices and frees players from buying expensive consoles and gaming computers. Gamers can keep playing major Activision titles, including mobile games like Candy Crush, on the platforms they typically use.“This means that it is vital that we protect competition in this emerging and exciting market,” he said.The U.K. decision further dashes Microsoft’s hopes that a favorable outcome could help it resolve a lawsuit brought by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. A trial before the FTC’s in-house judge is set to begin Aug. 2. The European Union’s decision, meanwhile, is due May 22.The California-based game maker said it would “work aggressively"" with Microsoft to appeal, asserting that the move “contradicts the ambitions of the U.K."" to be an attractive place for tech companies.""We will reassess our growth plans for the U.K. Global innovators large and small will take note that — despite all its rhetoric — the U.K. is clearly closed for business,” Activision said.“We remain fully committed to this acquisition and will appeal,” President Brad Smith said in a statement. The decision “rejects a pragmatic path to address competition concerns"" and discourages tech innovation and investment in Britain, he said.“We’re especially disappointed that after lengthy deliberations, this decision appears to reflect a flawed understanding of this market and the way the relevant cloud technology actually works,” Smith said.Activision CEO Bobby Kotick said in a blog post that both companies have begun working on an appeal to the U.K.'s Competition Appeal Tribunal.Microsoft already has a strong position in the overall cloud computing market, and regulators concluded that if the deal went through, it would reinforce the company’s advantage by giving it control of key game titles.Sony's European press office did not respond to a request for comment.The watchdog said it reviewed Microsoft’s remedies “in considerable depth” but found they would require its oversight, whereas preventing the merger would allow cloud gaming to develop without intervention.Cloud gaming is a small piece of Britain’s 5 billion pound ($6.2 billion) video game market. But an expert forecast suggested it will see explosive growth over the coming years, with user numbers tripling from the start of 2021 to the end of 2022 and the cloud game market expected to grow to a value of 1 billion pounds by 2026, regulators said.___AP Technology Writer Matt O'Brien in Providence, Rhode Island, contributed to this report.","April 26, 2023 at 6:22 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/uk-blocks-microsofts-activision-deal-112235797.html,AP Finance,0.0,0.0,-0.06795183982683983,0.48019480519480506

The video-game publisher was set to erase nearly $7 billion in market valuation, if the losses hold.Microsoft announced its Activision bid in January 2022 to boost its firepower in a video gaming market led by Tencent and Sony.The deal is the biggest involving technology companies the CMA has blocked, the latest sign the UK watchdog is ready to take on Big Tech after blocking in 2021 Facebook-owner Meta's acquisition of Giphy.Europe will decide on the Activision deal by May 22. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission is also seeking to block it.CLOUD CONCERNSThe surprise ruling comes after the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) last month dropped its concerns about the impact of the deal on the console market led by Sony's market-leading PlayStation.That left cloud streaming services as the remaining hurdle, which Microsoft sought to overcome by signing licensing deals with the owners of streaming platforms including Valve Corp, Nvidia and Boosteroid.It had already offered Sony - a vocal opponent of the deal - a 10-year ""Call of Duty"" licence, in line with an agreement to bring the multi-billion dollar franchise to Nintendo's Switch.The CMA said the cloud gaming market was forecast to be worth 11 billion pounds ($13.7 billion) globally by 2026.""Cloud gaming is growing fast with the potential to change gaming by altering the way games are played, freeing people from the need to rely on expensive consoles and gaming PCs and giving them more choice over how and where they play games,"" said CMA panel chair Martin Coleman.""This means that it is vital that we protect competition in this emerging and exciting market.""COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGESMicrosoft offers Xbox Game Pass, a subscription service for users of its Xbox console, and PC Game Pass for PC users.The CMA said Microsoft had an estimated 60%-70% of global cloud gaming services as well as competitive advantages including owning Xbox, PC operating system Windows and cloud provider Azure.The U.S. software giant offered licensing deals to allay the concerns, but the CMA said they would only include some Activision games, carried a significant risk of disagreement and would need overseeing by the regulator.It has offered similar remedies to the European Commission, which sources have told Reuters it is likely to accept.

The video-game publisher was set to erase nearly $8 billion in market valuation, if the losses hold.The gaming company also reported quarterly results on Wednesday, a day earlier than scheduled, beating quarterly bookings estimates although that seemed to do little to allay investor concerns about Britain's move.Shares in Microsoft rose to their highest in more than a year, a day after the maker of Office software beat Street estimates for quarterly revenue and profit.The company announced its Activision bid in January 2022 to boost its firepower in a video gaming market led by Tencent and Sony.""We expect that Microsoft will continue to fight this,"" Evercore ISI analyst Kirk Materne said in a note.If Microsoft throws in the towel, it would free up more than $60 billion in cash flow to either return to investors or make investments in AI-related offerings, he noted.The Activision deal is the biggest involving technology companies the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has blocked, the latest sign the UK watchdog is ready to take on Big Tech after blocking in 2021 Facebook-owner Meta's acquisition of Giphy.Europe will decide on the Activision deal by May 22. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission is also seeking to block it.CLOUD CONCERNSThe surprise ruling comes after the CMA last month dropped its concerns about the impact of the deal on the console market led by Sony's market-leading PlayStation.That left cloud streaming services as the remaining hurdle, which Microsoft sought to overcome by signing licensing deals with the owners of streaming platforms including Valve Corp, Nvidia and Boosteroid.It had already offered Sony - a vocal opponent of the deal - a 10-year ""Call of Duty"" licence, in line with an agreement to bring the multi-billion dollar franchise to Nintendo's Switch.The CMA said the cloud gaming market was forecast to be worth 11 billion pounds ($13.7 billion) globally by 2026.""Cloud gaming is growing fast with the potential to change gaming...freeing people from the need to rely on expensive consoles and gaming PCs and giving them more choice over how and where they play games,"" said CMA panel chair Martin Coleman.""This means that it is vital that we protect competition in this emerging and exciting market.""Microsoft offers Xbox Game Pass, a subscription service for users of its Xbox console, and PC Game Pass for PC users.The CMA said Microsoft had an estimated 60%-70% of global cloud gaming services as well as competitive advantages including owning Xbox, PC operating system Windows and cloud provider Azure.($1 = 0.8019 pounds)(Reporting by Paul Sandle; Additional reporting by Sayantani Ghosh; Editing by Kate Holton, Kirsten Donovan, Josephine Mason)","April 26, 2023 at 6:14 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/uk-blocks-microsoft-69-billion-111432242.html,Reuters,0.0,0.0,0.07872899159663867,0.47780112044817935

ATVI,Analysts Estimate Hasbro (HAS) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for,"The market expects Hasbro (HAS) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on April 27, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis toy maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.07 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -87.7%.Revenues are expected to be $885.45 million, down 23.9% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 13.18% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Hasbro?For Hasbro, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -42.81%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Hasbro will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Hasbro would post earnings of $1.30 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.31, delivering a surprise of +0.77%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Hasbro doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAnother stock from the Zacks Toys - Games - Hobbies industry, Activision Blizzard, Inc (ATVI), is soon expected to post earnings of $0.58 per share for the quarter ended March 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +52.6%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $1.83 billion, up 23.8% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Activision Blizzard, Inc has been revised 1.2% down to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 7.08%, reflecting a higher Most Accurate Estimate.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP indicates that Activision Blizzard, Inc will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Hasbro, Inc.

ATVI,Why Activision (ATVI) Might Surprise This Earnings Season,"That is because Activision is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for ATVI in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 62 cents per share for ATVI, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 58 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for ATVI, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +7.08% heading into earnings season.Activision Blizzard, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Activision Blizzard, Inc. QuoteA positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Activision, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.Activision Blizzard, Inc (ATVI) : Free Stock Analysis ReportTo read this article on Zacks.com click here.Zacks Investment Research","April 20, 2023 at 7:40 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-activision-atvi-might-surprise-124012230.html,Zacks,0.0,0.0,0.20128908128908127,0.5657728074394741

ATVI,"Tech Firms Try to Muzzle Workers With NDAs, SEC Tipsters Say","(Bloomberg) -- Some top US technology companies are forcing workers to sign allegedly illegal labor agreements, according to complaints filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, despite years of enforcement by the agency against the practice.Most Read from BloombergAirline Blunder Sells $10,000 Asia-US Business Class Tickets for $300Worthless Degrees Are Creating an Unemployable Generation in IndiaIndia Passes China as World’s Most Populous Nation, UN SaysTesla Slashes Prices of Key Models Again Ahead of EarningsFox’s $787.5 Million Settlement Doesn’t End Its Liability Over 2020 Election Fraud ClaimsFirms, including an Apple Inc. subcontractor, Electronic Arts Inc. and Block Inc. improperly used non-disclosure agreements that prohibit workers from reporting bad behavior to the SEC, according to tipster complaints viewed by Bloomberg News that were filed with the agency by law firm Kohn, Kohn & Colapinto LLP. The contracts, which ban employees from sharing confidential information with any outsider, don’t include an exception for alerting regulators.The claims were made as the SEC, under Gary Gensler, has stepped up enforcement of an agency rule stemming from the Dodd-Frank financial reform law. Under that rule, companies are explicitly prohibited from obstructing anyone from whistleblowing to the SEC. Enforcing the regulation is a top priority for Gurbir Grewal, the SEC’s enforcement director, according to a person familiar with his thinking who asked not to be identified discussing internal agency policy.A Block spokesperson said the company’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics affords all employees protection to communicate with government agencies. That policy is different from an employment contract, which legal experts said should include carve-outs for reporting wrongdoing to regulators. An Electronic Arts spokesperson declined to comment.SEC WhistleblowersSet up in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, the SEC’s whistleblower program has taken in thousands of tips, distributed over $1 billion in awards to tipsters, and become one of the agency’s favorite tools to stamp out corporate wrongdoing. The persistence of restrictive non-disclosure agreements threatens the agency’s efforts to hold companies accountable.The agency has brought 17 enforcement actions against companies for improper non-disclosure agreements since it started enforcing against the practice in 2015. Five of those were brought since President Joe Biden took office in 2021, compared with two during former President Donald Trump’s term. Most of the cases were brought during the Obama administration.Former SEC Chairman and Trump-appointee Jay Clayton said in an interview he brought cases as necessary to protect the rights of whistleblowers. “Companies should know how to draft agreements that are compliant with the law,” he said.The contracts show a “willful disregard” for the law and SEC rules given the public statements and numerous enforcement actions the agency has brought against such agreements, Kohn, Kohn & Colapinto wrote in a January complaint, which was one of those viewed by Bloomberg. The allegations referenced employment contracts from 2022 issued by Electronic Arts, one of the world’s biggest video game publishers, known for its Star Wars and sports games, and Jack Dorsey’s Block, which operates the Square digital payments service.Whistleblower attorneys are calling for steeper fines to put a stop to the practice, which has persisted even in the face of the renewed crackdown. They worry that such contracts, even if legally unenforceable, will discourage employees from reporting bad behavior to regulators. Gensler has lauded the whistleblower program since taking office. In August 2022, he said that it “has greatly aided the Commission’s work to protect investors.”The SEC rule extends beyond contracts that ban employees from talking to the agency. Firms can get in trouble if they require leaving employees to forfeit their rights to get whistleblower awards, as an Atlanta firm was accused of doing by the SEC in 2016. SEC whistleblowers can get up to 30% of the fines collected from an agency enforcement action.Thomas Le Bonniec, who worked for Apple subcontractor GlobeTech Services Ltd., said he initially struggled with coming forward with allegations about Siri’s privacy practices because of his restrictive non-disclosure agreement. His contract threatened unspecified “monetary damages” if he shared confidential information “outside of work” — with no exceptions, according to his complaint.“It was scary. I thought I may end up broke for the rest of my life,” said Le Bonniec, who is represented by Kohn, Kohn & Colapinto, in an interview.As a dedicated Siri data analyst, Le Bonniec said he heard conversations he believed violated users’ privacy, including details about sexual preferences, bank account numbers and health problems. He said that the importance of exposing the existence of the recordings outweighed the risks of breaking his agreement, so he went public. After an outcry by consumers, Apple made changes to Siri to address privacy concerns.Le Bonniec said he essentially operated as an Apple employee, used a designated email address and exclusively delivered work for the company. He believes the tech giant should be held accountable for its subcontractor’s employment agreement.After leaving his job at GlobeTech, Le Bonniec filed a previously unreported complaint with the SEC in 2020, accusing the Apple subcontractor of giving him a nondisclosure form that impeded employees from reporting wrongdoing to the agency.“Enforcing against these violations would send a clear message that publicly owned companies in the United States cannot use subcontractors to circumvent regulatory requirements they are bound to comply with regardless of where they operate,” according to his complaint, which accuses both Apple and GlobeTech of violating the SEC rule.A spokesperson for Apple declined to comment. GlobeTech didn’t return an emailed request for comment.SEC EnforcementEmployers have been on notice over the issue since 2015 when government contractor KBR Inc. agreed, without admitting or denying the allegations, to pay a $130,000 fine. The company also changed a confidentiality statement to inform employees they weren’t required to notify the firm before reporting suspected legal violations to any governmental agency.At least a dozen companies continued to leave out exceptions for reporting to the SEC, according to a review by Bloomberg News of confidentiality agreements issued in the past two years and found in recent filings with the agency.“To the extent this is still happening, it’s concerning,” said Dan Berkovitz, who served as the SEC’s general counsel until January. “The SEC has issued fines against companies for restrictive confidentiality agreements that don’t provide explicit carve-outs.”Last year, cash-management business Brink’s Co. agreed, without admitting or denying wrongdoing, to pay a $400,000 penalty and to change its employment agreements to include a carve-out for whistleblowers to report to any government agency.Some companies have run into trouble even when using carve-outs.In February, video game company Activision Blizzard Inc. settled allegations that it violated the rule by using separation agreements that required employees to notify the company first before responding to information requests from administrative agencies.The SEC concluded in a settlement about the company’s business practices that even though most of Activision’s agreements included a separate carve-out for reporting to the regulator, the notification requirement undermined the rule. The company didn’t admit or deny wrongdoing.“As the order recognizes, we enhanced disclosure processes with regard to workplace reporting, and updated our separation contract language,” a company spokesperson said.As enforcement ramps up, whistleblower advocates are also pushing for tougher penalties, arguing that the current level of fines makes it an acceptable cost of doing business to violate the rule.“Until their fines get a little bigger, some companies are going to roll the dice,” said Mary Inman, a partner at Constantine Cannon, who represents whistleblowers. “It is a small price to pay to silence a whistleblower.”(Updates with detail on the SEC whistleblower program from ninth paragraph)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekAmericans Go Deeper Into Debt as They Use Buy Now, Pay Later Apps for GroceriesVolkswagen Left Behind as China Goes All In on EVsPeople Are Using AI for Therapy, Even Though ChatGPT Wasn’t Built for ItRepublicans Fight a Solar Boom That’s Made Texas King of Clean EnergyA Decade After the Rana Plaza Collapse, Garment Workers Are Still Exploited©2023 Bloomberg L.P.","April 18, 2023 at 4:51 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tech-firms-try-muzzle-workers-215118987.html,Bloomberg,-0.1,0.6,-0.027447916666666666,0.42645833333333333

EA,Electronic Arts Inc.'s (NASDAQ:EA) Has Had A Decent Run On The Stock market: Are Fundamentals In The Driver's Seat?,"Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. Check out our latest analysis for Electronic Arts Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Electronic Arts is:14% = US$1.0b ÷ US$7.6b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.14 in profit.We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.At first glance, Electronic Arts seems to have a decent ROE. And on comparing with the industry, we found that the the average industry ROE is similar at 14%. However, while Electronic Arts has a pretty respectable ROE, its five year net income decline rate was 9.0% . We reckon that there could be some other factors at play here that are preventing the company's growth. For example, it could be that the company has a high payout ratio or the business has allocated capital poorly, for instance.That being said, we compared Electronic Arts' performance with the industry and were concerned when we found that while the company has shrunk its earnings, the industry has grown its earnings at a rate of 17% in the same period.Electronic Arts' low three-year median payout ratio of 22% (implying that it retains the remaining 78% of its profits) comes as a surprise when you pair it with the shrinking earnings. The low payout should mean that the company is retaining most of its earnings and consequently, should see some growth. So there could be some other explanations in that regard. For example, the company's business may be deteriorating.Only recently, Electronic Arts stated paying a dividend. This likely means that the management might have concluded that its shareholders have a strong preference for dividends. Existing analyst estimates suggest that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 10% over the next three years. Accordingly, the expected drop in the payout ratio explains the expected increase in the company's ROE to 26%, over the same period.","May 3, 2023 at 6:47 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/electronic-arts-inc-nasdaq-ea-114705656.html,Simply Wall St.,0.16666666666666666,0.6666666666666666,0.08583333333333333,0.4346794871794871

The chosen companies are either entirely focused on gaming, have a separate gaming division in the company, or provide products that are focused on the gaming industry.The hedge fund sentiment around each stock has been taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 943 elite hedge funds.Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 28Sony Group Corporation (NYSE:SONY) released its Q4 results on April 28, where it reported a GAAP EPS of ¥103.53 (1 Japanese Yen = 0.0073 USD) and revenue of ¥3.06 trillion, up 35.3% YoY. For FY 2024, the company provided revenue guidance of ¥11.5 trillion and ¥840 billion for net income.“Sony Group Corporation (NYSE:SONY), the global provider of video games and consoles, image sensors, and music, as well as movies, was a major detractor for the period. The share price of the company has struggled this year following its strong performance in 2021. Signs of a slowdown in the gaming industry (as people seem inclined to take on outdoor activities as pandemic fears have subsided), combined with sales of its PlayStation 5 that have been held up by a global parts shortage, have led to gaming‐related software sales falling more than 20% year‐over‐year. Rather than focusing on short‐term demand dislocations, we focus on the company’s ability to continue migrating videogame users toward the firm’s subscription offerings, as well as its capacity to leverage content across its video, music and gaming platforms. We are also impressed with the expansion of Sony’s Music segment, which has been supported by the pervasiveness of streaming services. Management’s ongoing work to improve the company’s TV and film studios is bearing fruit as well, with sales growing 67% year‐over‐year for its Pictures segment as its regional strategy has taken hold, including recent progress made toward solidifying a merger plan with India‐based Zee Entertainment. All of this is to say we remain excited by the oligopolistic nature of the businesses Sony operates in, and the future prospects for the company given its leadership in image sensors, music publishing and gaming consoles.”Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 29Roblox Corporation (NYSE:RBLX) is a California-based gaming and multimedia company.

EA,Electronic Arts (EA) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,"The market expects Electronic Arts (EA) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on May 9, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis video game maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.32 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +11.9%.Revenues are expected to be $1.73 billion, down 1.2% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.93% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Electronic Arts?For Electronic Arts, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +2.08%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Electronic Arts will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Electronic Arts would post earnings of $3.05 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.71, delivering a surprise of -11.15%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Electronic Arts appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Electronic Arts Inc.

EA,"Tech Firms Try to Muzzle Workers With NDAs, SEC Tipsters Say","(Bloomberg) -- Some top US technology companies are forcing workers to sign allegedly illegal labor agreements, according to complaints filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, despite years of enforcement by the agency against the practice.Most Read from BloombergAirline Blunder Sells $10,000 Asia-US Business Class Tickets for $300Worthless Degrees Are Creating an Unemployable Generation in IndiaIndia Passes China as World’s Most Populous Nation, UN SaysTesla Slashes Prices of Key Models Again Ahead of EarningsFox’s $787.5 Million Settlement Doesn’t End Its Liability Over 2020 Election Fraud ClaimsFirms, including an Apple Inc. subcontractor, Electronic Arts Inc. and Block Inc. improperly used non-disclosure agreements that prohibit workers from reporting bad behavior to the SEC, according to tipster complaints viewed by Bloomberg News that were filed with the agency by law firm Kohn, Kohn & Colapinto LLP. The contracts, which ban employees from sharing confidential information with any outsider, don’t include an exception for alerting regulators.The claims were made as the SEC, under Gary Gensler, has stepped up enforcement of an agency rule stemming from the Dodd-Frank financial reform law. Under that rule, companies are explicitly prohibited from obstructing anyone from whistleblowing to the SEC. Enforcing the regulation is a top priority for Gurbir Grewal, the SEC’s enforcement director, according to a person familiar with his thinking who asked not to be identified discussing internal agency policy.A Block spokesperson said the company’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics affords all employees protection to communicate with government agencies. That policy is different from an employment contract, which legal experts said should include carve-outs for reporting wrongdoing to regulators. An Electronic Arts spokesperson declined to comment.SEC WhistleblowersSet up in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, the SEC’s whistleblower program has taken in thousands of tips, distributed over $1 billion in awards to tipsters, and become one of the agency’s favorite tools to stamp out corporate wrongdoing. The persistence of restrictive non-disclosure agreements threatens the agency’s efforts to hold companies accountable.The agency has brought 17 enforcement actions against companies for improper non-disclosure agreements since it started enforcing against the practice in 2015. Five of those were brought since President Joe Biden took office in 2021, compared with two during former President Donald Trump’s term. Most of the cases were brought during the Obama administration.Former SEC Chairman and Trump-appointee Jay Clayton said in an interview he brought cases as necessary to protect the rights of whistleblowers. “Companies should know how to draft agreements that are compliant with the law,” he said.The contracts show a “willful disregard” for the law and SEC rules given the public statements and numerous enforcement actions the agency has brought against such agreements, Kohn, Kohn & Colapinto wrote in a January complaint, which was one of those viewed by Bloomberg. The allegations referenced employment contracts from 2022 issued by Electronic Arts, one of the world’s biggest video game publishers, known for its Star Wars and sports games, and Jack Dorsey’s Block, which operates the Square digital payments service.Whistleblower attorneys are calling for steeper fines to put a stop to the practice, which has persisted even in the face of the renewed crackdown. They worry that such contracts, even if legally unenforceable, will discourage employees from reporting bad behavior to regulators. Gensler has lauded the whistleblower program since taking office. In August 2022, he said that it “has greatly aided the Commission’s work to protect investors.”The SEC rule extends beyond contracts that ban employees from talking to the agency. Firms can get in trouble if they require leaving employees to forfeit their rights to get whistleblower awards, as an Atlanta firm was accused of doing by the SEC in 2016. SEC whistleblowers can get up to 30% of the fines collected from an agency enforcement action.Thomas Le Bonniec, who worked for Apple subcontractor GlobeTech Services Ltd., said he initially struggled with coming forward with allegations about Siri’s privacy practices because of his restrictive non-disclosure agreement. His contract threatened unspecified “monetary damages” if he shared confidential information “outside of work” — with no exceptions, according to his complaint.“It was scary. I thought I may end up broke for the rest of my life,” said Le Bonniec, who is represented by Kohn, Kohn & Colapinto, in an interview.As a dedicated Siri data analyst, Le Bonniec said he heard conversations he believed violated users’ privacy, including details about sexual preferences, bank account numbers and health problems. He said that the importance of exposing the existence of the recordings outweighed the risks of breaking his agreement, so he went public. After an outcry by consumers, Apple made changes to Siri to address privacy concerns.Le Bonniec said he essentially operated as an Apple employee, used a designated email address and exclusively delivered work for the company. He believes the tech giant should be held accountable for its subcontractor’s employment agreement.After leaving his job at GlobeTech, Le Bonniec filed a previously unreported complaint with the SEC in 2020, accusing the Apple subcontractor of giving him a nondisclosure form that impeded employees from reporting wrongdoing to the agency.“Enforcing against these violations would send a clear message that publicly owned companies in the United States cannot use subcontractors to circumvent regulatory requirements they are bound to comply with regardless of where they operate,” according to his complaint, which accuses both Apple and GlobeTech of violating the SEC rule.A spokesperson for Apple declined to comment. GlobeTech didn’t return an emailed request for comment.SEC EnforcementEmployers have been on notice over the issue since 2015 when government contractor KBR Inc. agreed, without admitting or denying the allegations, to pay a $130,000 fine. The company also changed a confidentiality statement to inform employees they weren’t required to notify the firm before reporting suspected legal violations to any governmental agency.At least a dozen companies continued to leave out exceptions for reporting to the SEC, according to a review by Bloomberg News of confidentiality agreements issued in the past two years and found in recent filings with the agency.“To the extent this is still happening, it’s concerning,” said Dan Berkovitz, who served as the SEC’s general counsel until January. “The SEC has issued fines against companies for restrictive confidentiality agreements that don’t provide explicit carve-outs.”Last year, cash-management business Brink’s Co. agreed, without admitting or denying wrongdoing, to pay a $400,000 penalty and to change its employment agreements to include a carve-out for whistleblowers to report to any government agency.Some companies have run into trouble even when using carve-outs.In February, video game company Activision Blizzard Inc. settled allegations that it violated the rule by using separation agreements that required employees to notify the company first before responding to information requests from administrative agencies.The SEC concluded in a settlement about the company’s business practices that even though most of Activision’s agreements included a separate carve-out for reporting to the regulator, the notification requirement undermined the rule. The company didn’t admit or deny wrongdoing.“As the order recognizes, we enhanced disclosure processes with regard to workplace reporting, and updated our separation contract language,” a company spokesperson said.As enforcement ramps up, whistleblower advocates are also pushing for tougher penalties, arguing that the current level of fines makes it an acceptable cost of doing business to violate the rule.“Until their fines get a little bigger, some companies are going to roll the dice,” said Mary Inman, a partner at Constantine Cannon, who represents whistleblowers. “It is a small price to pay to silence a whistleblower.”(Updates with detail on the SEC whistleblower program from ninth paragraph)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekAmericans Go Deeper Into Debt as They Use Buy Now, Pay Later Apps for GroceriesVolkswagen Left Behind as China Goes All In on EVsPeople Are Using AI for Therapy, Even Though ChatGPT Wasn’t Built for ItRepublicans Fight a Solar Boom That’s Made Texas King of Clean EnergyA Decade After the Rana Plaza Collapse, Garment Workers Are Still Exploited©2023 Bloomberg L.P.","April 18, 2023 at 4:51 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tech-firms-try-muzzle-workers-215118987.html,Bloomberg,-0.1,0.6,-0.027447916666666666,0.42645833333333333
EA,How to Find Strong Consumer Discretionary Stocks Slated for Positive Earnings Surprises,"Wall Street watches a company's quarterly report closely to understand as much as possible about its recent performance and what to expect going forward. Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.Boyd Gaming's Earnings ESP sits at 4.06%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $1.56 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.50.Electronic Arts, which is readying to report earnings on May 9, 2023, sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now. It's Most Accurate Estimate is currently $1.34 a share, and EA is 18 days out from its next earnings report.For Electronic Arts, the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.32 is 1.32%.BYD and EA's positive ESP figures tell us that both stocks have a good chance at beating analyst expectations in their next earnings report.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

EA,Can Videogame Makers Bounce Back From Previous Lows?,"The videogame industry, which reached unprecedented heights during the peak of the pandemic saw a steep decline in sales in 2022. Videogame sales slowed and then plummeted as the economy reopened and life got back to normal.However, the economic reopening wasn’t the only reason that adversely impacted sales. A dearth of new title releases is also to blame for the sudden decline in sales of videogames. However, the industry is finally rebounding as videogame makers have started releasing new titles and console games.After taking a massive hit last year, videogame sales have had a good 2023. According to the latest data from Circana, spending on videogames and accessories hit $4.6 billion in February, increasing 6% on a year-over-year basis. This is the highest year-over-year percentage growth since October 2021, after which the market started suffering.The report further mentions that gamers spent $3.89 billion on videogame content, up 1% on a year-over-year basis. “Growth in digital content across Console and PC platforms, as well as non-mobile subscription spending, offset a decline in mobile,” Circana executive director Mat Piscatella said.As people spent aggressively on new games, hardware sales also skyrocketed, hitting a 14-year high. Hardware sales increased 68% year over year to record $495 million, reaching its highest level since February 2009, when sales reached $534 million.There are a number of factors behind the decline in videogame sales over the past year. Sales in 2020 were boosted by the pandemic. As a result, the gaming industry grew by 26% between 2019 and 2021, hitting record-high sales of $191 billion. Videogame sales have been on the rise since 2015, and the epidemic gave them a further boost.Experts had predicted that sales would plummet with the economy reopening as consumers would have more options for outdoor entertainment.However, the predictions didn’t match, and sales continued to grow even in 2021 as spending shot up on multiple title releases.Sony also reported solid third-quarter fiscal 2023 revenues. The company reported 53% growth in revenues in its Game & Network Services (G&NS) segment, hitting $9.6 billion year over year.However, Electronic Arts is hopeful about 2023 as it plans to revamp existing brands and come up with new titles.The videogame market appears to be aggressively rebounding. Demand for both software and hardware is projected to rise in 2023 as more next-generation consoles and new games go on sale.Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) : Free Stock Analysis ReportActivision Blizzard, Inc (ATVI) : Free Stock Analysis ReportElectronic Arts Inc.

EA,EA shares inch higher after video game maker unveils 6% workforce cut,"By Scott KanowskyInvesting.com -- Analysts on Thursday said they were widely unsurprised by Electronic Arts' (NASDAQ:EA) decision to trim its workforce by about 6% and cut back on office space, arguing that the move was broadly foreshadowed by the group.In a note released after the close of U.S. markets on Wednesday, chief executive officer Andrew Wilson told employees that the firm will be restructuring some of its teams and reviewing its real estate holdings in a bid to ""drive greater focus across our portfolio.""According to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, EA expects to incur between $170 million to $200 million in charges in connection with the overhaul. The actions associated with the plan, EA added, are projected to be ""substantially complete"" by September 30.California-based EA's headcount came in at a little under 13,000 at the end of March 2022, a quarterly filing showed. Although the group did not confirm exactly how many workers would lose their jobs, analysts' estimates equate a 6% reduction in staff to approximately 800 employees laid off.""Where we can, we are providing opportunities for our colleagues to transition onto other projects. Where that's not possible, we are providing severance pay and additional benefits such as health care and career transition services,"" Wilson said. ""Communicating these decisions began earlier this quarter and we expect them to continue through early next fiscal year.""Shares in EA edged slightly higher after hovering near the flatline in early U.S. trading today.In a note to clients, analysts at Baird that the job cuts are a ""step towards achieving more consistent bookings and profit performance,"" adding that it makes sense for EA to focus on its more established gaming titles like its mega-popular FIFA soccer franchise and shooter Apex Legends.Analysts at Baird also noted that the cutbacks were in line with their expectations, and follow a similar trend of layoffs seen recently throughout the technology sector.Related ArticlesEA shares inch higher after video game maker unveils 6% workforce cutIcahn, Illumina discussed settlement before proxy fight - filingVolcon launches Grunt EVO and Runt LT electric off-road motorcycles","March 30, 2023 at 5:02 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ea-shares-inch-higher-video-110209895.html,Investing.com,-0.07500000000000001,0.45,0.08333333333333336,0.4013888888888889

EA,Estimating The Intrinsic Value Of Electronic Arts Inc. (NASDAQ:EA),"Electronic Arts' estimated fair value is US$138 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to EquityElectronic Arts' US$119 share price indicates it is trading at similar levels as its fair value estimate View our latest analysis for Electronic Arts We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$1.22bUS$1.89bUS$1.99bUS$2.27bUS$2.44bUS$2.57bUS$2.69bUS$2.80bUS$2.89bUS$2.97bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x9Analyst x9Analyst x8Analyst x1Est @ 7.20%Est @ 5.66%Est @ 4.58%Est @ 3.83%Est @ 3.30%Est @ 2.93% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.1% US$1.1kUS$1.6kUS$1.6kUS$1.7kUS$1.6kUS$1.6kUS$1.6kUS$1.5kUS$1.4kUS$1.4kWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 8.1%.The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$38b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$119, the company appears about fair value at a 14% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.We would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Electronic Arts as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.1%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.023. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.StrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is not viewed as a risk.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Entertainment market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Current share price is below our estimate of fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. For Electronic Arts, we've compiled three fundamental factors you should explore:","March 27, 2023 at 8:12 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/estimating-intrinsic-value-electronic-arts-141258097.html,Simply Wall St.,0.0,0.0,0.11522222222222221,0.4667174603174603

The Forward PE is 26 and the stock pays no dividend.In early March, the company reported a big earnings beat that helped the stock shoot higher. The 266% EPS beat was the second in a row and the fourth out of the last five quarters.Looking at estimates, we see a big turn in the numbers since earnings.Over the last 30 days, the current year's estimates have gone from -$0.13 to $2.96. Expectations for next year have surged higher as well. Over the last 30 days, estimates went up by 74%, from $2.16 to $3.76.Since earnings, the stock has received a couple upgrades, with the biggest coming from JPMorgan. The firm went to Overweight and lifted targets to $95 from $75. These targets are about 25% above current trading levels.The stock will likely take years before it can get back to those all-time highs it saw back in 2021. Despite the big drop in value, the stock seems to be finding buyers since that big earnings beat.For those not looking to chase, buying the dips at moving averages might be a good strategy. The current levels are as follows:21-day Moving Average (MA): $7050-day MA: $66.50200-day MA: $65For those that look at Fibonacci levels, the 61.8% retrace from August highs to November lows has been broken. Aggressive bulls can target the $126 level.The bulls in 2021 got way ahead of themselves and paid for it dearly. The valuation was just not realistic and the stock dropped almost 90%. But SE has doubled since as the bears undervalued the company.The stock might trade in a sideways range for a bit as these bull and bear forces collide. But considering the earnings momentum and the bullish chart, investors will likely be rewarded buying any moderate dips.While most tech stocks sold off over the last year, EA held up well and traded mostly sideways. However, a recent earnings report took the stock to 52-week lows. Estimates are falling and investors are getting nervous that the stocks momentum might be turning the wrong way.EA is headquartered in Redwood City, CA.The company was founded in 1982 and employs about 13,000. Some popular EA games include Battlefield, The Sims, Apex Legends, Need for Speed, and license games from others, including FIFA, Madden NFL, UFC, and Star Wars brands.The company is valued at $31 billion and has a Forward PE of 19. EA holds Zacks Style Scores of ""B"" in Growth, but ""F"" in Value and ""F"" in Momentum. The stock pays a small dividend of 0.7%.Electronic Arts posted earnings in late January, disappointing investors with an 11% EPS miss. Revenues missed expectations and the company cut its FY22 outlook.EA also cut Q4 GAAP EPS to a range of $0.05-0.20 v the expected $2.23. Additionally, they cut their FY22 GAAP EPS and their FY22 net bookings.Management blamed the results on the current macro environment and said they will focus on building for the long-term.Investors clearly didn't like the quarter and the stock fell almost 10% the next day. Since then, the stock has drifted lower, along with earnings estimates.Since earnings, the stock has seen analyst estimates drop across most time frames.Over the last 60 days, the current quarter has been lowered by 40%, going from $2.23 to $1.32. While next quarter estimates are ticking slightly higher, they continue to fall over the long-term. Over the last 60 days, next year's earnings estimates have fallen from $7.69 to $6.51, or 15%.Analysts have lowered price targets for the stock as well. JPMorgan took the stock down from $141 to $125. UBS cut to $140 from $155. And Wells Fargo lowered its target to $120 from $150.The stock held up well for most of 2022 as many stocks were being sold aggressively. We saw a sideways trading range from $130 to $150 until the second half of the year when that range dropped to $115-135.But with the stock hitting 52-week lows, it looks like another trading range will develop, possibly in the $100-120 range.The upside seems very limited, with the 200-day MA being major resistance at $124. Zooming the chart out, a break of the $105 level could bring some technical selling down to the 85-$90 area. This range was a big consolidation area in 2019 and should offer support.EA was giving investors a nice place to hide in 2022. However, the stock is looking very weak after the latest earnings report. Investors should be cautious as technical selling could bring the stock under $100 rather quickly.There is an entire paradigm shift happening in the security and safety services market, mainly because of the adoption of IP-based cameras. Being connected to the Internet, these cameras allow remote surveillance. Moreover, because of the development of artificial intelligence (AI)-powered algorithms to decipher this data, the output is far more comprehensible than it has ever been before.As a result, governments, commercial operations, communities and other establishments with the goal of protection, safety and/or surveillance of people or assets, are rapidly deploying these cameras. This is the strongest driver of growth for the segment, according to independent market research.India and China are rapidly building out their commercial infrastructure, which is expected to lead to a significant increase in the deployment of security systems.The smart cities coming up across the world are also consuming a lot of electronic safety systems, which is driving demand in this fast-growing segment.A big part of safety is keeping up with regulatory requirements and protocols for fire. Because of technological developments, these systems too are undergoing a huge change.The pandemic was a big blow to the segment because of the slowdown in construction activity and the supply chain issues that followed. The inflation resulting from the government stimulus also increased raw material costs. The labor crunch that affected most of the economy also impacted this segment. Therefore, although not as badly as they were last year, companies in this industry are still seeing some of the effects in the limited supply of key components, rising input costs and labor tightness, although they are mostly compensating with price hikes even as they work to diversify their supply chains.There has been one positive fallout of the pandemic, as well. Because of the need for social distancing and some governments controlling the movement of citizens through apps, there has been increased awareness about the loss of privacy in such cases. Therefore, a number of governments in the West have laid down certain privacy rules with which device suppliers have to comply. This, in turn, is increasing demand for more innovative solutions that are also in compliance with government mandates.Other than commercial operations, there is an increase in public security system installations, as governments and administrative bodies also up the ante on security following the increased level of terrorism, vandalism, wars and violence around the world and in the schools and colleges in our backyard.Market researcher Mordor Intelligence estimates that commercial security system demand will grow a robust 8.5% CAGR in the next six years to 2028, second only to the public security systems segment, which according to MarketsandMarkets will grow at a CAGR of 10.3%. As the outlook for residential and community construction is not as bright (in the U.S.), there will be lower uptake in this segment until this situation changes.Speaking of which, the markets continue to look troubled following the banking stress, people continue to pull money out of the smaller regional banks and worried investors continue to liquidate their bank holdings. But for all of the reasons highlighted, the security and safety services industry looks like a relatively safe bet, as far as equities go.Here are three stocks from the industry that I've picked because of their growth potential through these difficult times:Amityville, New York-based Napco is focused on developing, manufacturing and selling electronic security products in the U.S. and internationally. The company offers access control systems, door-locking products, intrusion and fire alarm systems, and video surveillance systems for commercial, residential, institutional, industrial and governmental applications.It also buys and resells various identification readers, video cameras, PC-based computers and peripheral equipment for access control and video surveillance systems, and markets peripheral and related equipment manufactured by other companies. The company markets and sells its products primarily to independent distributors, dealers and installers of security equipment.Napco is managing continued supply chain issues by re-engineering products, developing alternatives, lowering cost and using more readily available supply sources and delivery methods while continuing to work closely with its customers and suppliers to see the whole thing through. While its strategy of temporarily sourcing higher-priced components for its radios is a pressure on profitability, the company is more than making up with the recurring revenue that these installed and operating radios generate.Analysts expect the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock to generate double-digit revenue and earnings growth in both its fiscal years 2023 and 2024 (ending in June). Revenue and earnings growth in the current year is expected to be 21.4% and 97.7%, respectively. Next year, there's expected to be further growth of 15.0% and 37.7%, respectively. The 2023 estimate has increased 16.4% in the last 60 days, while the 2024 estimate has increased 5.4%.Brady Corporation Milwaukee, Wisconsin-based Brady Corp. manufactures and supplies identification solutions (IDS) and workplace safety (WPS) products to identify and protect premises, products and people in the US and internationally. The IDS segment serves industrial and electronic manufacturing, healthcare, chemical, oil, gas, automotive, aerospace, governments, mass transit, electrical contractors, education, leisure and entertainment, telecommunications, and other industries through distributors, a direct sales force and digital channels.The WPS segment provides workplace safety, identification and compliance products, including signs, tags, labels, and markings; informational signage and markings of various kinds; facility safety and personal protection equipment; first-aid products; and labor law and other compliance posters for process, government, education, construction and utilities industries, as well as manufacturers through catalog and digital channels.Brady has generated organic sales growth of at least 6% in each of the last eight quarters despite the macro concerns and currency headwinds it has been up against. Its success is largely related to its pipeline of innovative products, a number of which will launch in the second half of the year. It has also restructured the Workplace Safety segment to simplify the product offering, streamline the cost structure and improve its price competitiveness, which has helped it generate organic sales growth and increased segment profit.Management expects that the reorganization of its operating segments into Americas & Asia and Europe & Australia will allow it to apply its best go-to-market strategies in key geographies, facilitate new product development in recent acquisitions and further simplify its global businesses. Management is very upbeat about the current level of demand and expects it to hold up.Analysts apparently agree because they've taken both 2023 (ending July) and 2024 estimates up 15 cents in the last 30 days. Revenue estimates are not available, but these revisions to the earnings estimates represent 9.5% growth in 2023 followed by 1.5% growth in 2024.Allegion plc Dublin, Ireland-based Allegion manufactures and sells mechanical and electronic security products worldwide for commercial, institutional and residential facilities, including educational, healthcare, governmental, hospitality, commercial office, and single and multi-family residential markets. Its main product lines are door controls, locking systems, and electronic security and access control systems.It also provides related inspection, maintenance and repair services, as well as related software. Through a software as a service (SaaS) model, it offers access control, IoT integration and workforce management solutions.Allegion continues to offset currency headwinds and inflation with strong price realization across products and channels as well as increased leverage from very strong non-residential volumes in the Americas. While the supply situation continues to improve, Allegion has resorted to engineering redesigns and alternate supply actions that are helping it normalize lead times in mechanical products. It has also added a 350,000 square foot manufacturing facility in Central Mexico to near-shore supply.Analysts are very upbeat about its prospects. For 2023, their revenue estimates represent 9.7% growth while earnings estimates represent 11.8% growth. This is expected to be followed by another 3.0% revenue growth and 7.0% earnings growth in 2024. In the last 30 days, the 2023 estimate increased 3.9% while the 2024 estimate increased less than a percentage point.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

EA,10 Most Promising Metaverse Stocks to Buy,"The metaverse is a potential growth market in technology.Given it's new and unproven, it is uncertain how big it will be.One company, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), has invested tens of billions into trying to make it a reality.According to the company in November of 2022, 80% of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)'s investments goes to its core social media business and slightly less than 20% goes into the company's Reality Labs segment, which houses its metaverse efforts.Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg explained the reasoning behind the huge investment, ""We're not going to be here in the 2030s communicating and using computing devices that are exactly the same as what we have today. If someone has to build that and invest in it and believe in it, there's a lot of new technology that needs to get invented to create that. So I'm still very optimistic about that.""Zuckerberg also said of the metaverse, ""Metaverse isn't a thing a company builds. It's the next chapter of the internet overall.""Given the technology to power a metaverse isn't fully developed yet, the current metaverse products aren't that great.Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) has lost a lot of money as a result of its investments. The company, nevertheless, plans to invest at least tens of billions more into the effort.The big investments in the metaverse also mean more business for other companies as well.To power the metaverse, companies will need processing power. For avatars and games, some companies may made need licensing. Once built, gaming and e-commerce could be big future segments in the metaverse.Because the technology to create a compelling metaverse hasn't been invented yet, it's not clear how big it could be. If Zuckerberg is right on the metaverse, the market could be considerable.If the future metaverse isn't as compelling for various reasons, on the other hand, it might not be a big market. If the only way to access the metaverse is through augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) headsets for instance, and not many people want to wear a headset, the market might not be very big.Given the uncertainty, it might be a good idea for long term investors to own leading profitable blue chip technology stocks that have additional growth potential in the metaverse. Because the metaverse is uncertain, it could be also be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of leading stocks across many different sectors.ymgerman/Shutterstock.comMethodologyFor our list of 10 Most Promising Metaverse Stocks to Buy, we chose 10 blue chip technology stocks with competitive advantages that have future growth potential from the metaverse.We sorted the stocks based on the number of hedge funds in our database of 943 funds that held shares in the same stock at the end of Q4.Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 46Electronic Arts Inc. (NASDAQ:EA) is a leading video game maker that could realize more demand as the metaverse grows given gaming could be one of the biggest markets in the metaverse in the future. With fairly realistic graphics in the metaverse, it could be possible to play games in a whole new way that could add more value to Electronic Arts Inc. (NASDAQ:EA)'s products.For the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2022, or Q3 FY23, Electronic Arts Inc. (NASDAQ:EA) had total net revenue of $1.881 billion and net income of $204 million. Diluted earnings per share was $0.73 and the company repurchased $325 million worth of shares.Alongside Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Electronic Arts Inc. (NASDAQ:EA) is a metaverse stock that many hedge funds in our database owned at the end of Q4.Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 59ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) is a leader in semiconducting producing equipment. To build the metaverse, some companies like Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) will have to spend a lot of capital that will increase the demand for semiconductors. If the metaverse is a success, processing demand and demand for semiconductors will also increase.Given ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) is currently the leader in an essential part of the semiconductor equipment industry, it stands to benefit from the potential growth.The New York Times describes ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML)'s importance in 2021, ""The machine is made by ASML Holding, based in Veldhoven. Its system uses a different kind of light to define ultrasmall circuitry on chips, packing more performance into the small slices of silicon. The tool, which took decades to develop and was introduced for high-volume manufacturing in 2017, costs more than $150 million. Shipping it to customers requires 40 shipping containers, 20 trucks and three Boeing 747s. The complex machine is widely acknowledged as necessary for making the most advanced chips, an ability with geopolitical implications.""Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 97Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is a leading semiconductor company that could benefit from the metaverse by potentially realizing more demand for its semiconductors. Companies like Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) already use Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) semiconductors for some of their data center processing needs, and demand could increase in the future if the metaverse expands.Nevertheless, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is riskier than some of the other stocks on our list given big tech companies can make their own semiconductor chips to save money. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) also has a forward P/E ratio of 18.83 which indicates that the market expects a lot of growth in the future. If the company misses growth expectations, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) could underperform.Of the 943 hedge funds in our database, 97 owned shares of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) at the end of Q4, ranking the stock #8 on our list of 10 Most Promising Metaverse Stocks to Buy.Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 99The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) is an entertainment conglomerate that has metaverse growth potential given it owns many valuable entertainment franchises such as the Marvel Entertainment and Star Wars that it can make games or create valuable experiences from. The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) also has a leading streaming service, Disney+, which already gives the company a huge online userbase to offer potential services to in the future. 99 hedge funds in our database owned shares of The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) at the end of Q4, making it one of the more widely held entertainment stocks in our database.Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 106NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) ranks #6 on our list of 10 Most Promising Metaverse Stocks to Buy given 106 hedge funds owned shares of the company at the end of Q4. Like Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) benefits from the metaverse with potentially more demand for its GPUs. If the metaverse grows, demand for the company's GPUs could grow assuming the company can maintain its technological lead for the semiconductors.Although NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has growth potential, it also faces a challenge in case big tech companies decide to make their own semiconductors in large quantities. As a result, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) will need to continue to innovate to keep growing and the stock could be riskier than the non-semiconductor stocks in our list.For fiscal 2023 which is the trailing twelve months ended January 29, 2023, the company's sales were $26.97 billion, flat from a year ago. Adjusted EPS were $3.34, down 25% from a year ago. In the year, the company returned $10.44 billion in combined share repurchases and cash dividends for shareholders.Like NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) are metaverse stocks that many hedge funds in our database owned at the end of Q4.Suggested articles:10 High Growth AI Stocks to Buy10 High Growth Low Dividend Stocks to Buy10 High Growth Low Debt Stocks to Buy","March 6, 2023 at 11:42 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-most-promising-metaverse-stocks-174246297.html,Insider Monkey,0.35,0.5,0.15118262456497755,0.46473828925509597
EA,11 Best Debt Free Stocks to Buy,"Debt free stocks have more cash than they do debt.The truly debt free profitable companies have more flexibility than similar companies that have a lot of debt.Interest rates have increased substantially in 2022 and it's likely they will increase further in 2023. With higher interest rates, stocks with a lot of debt have more interest payments if their debt is variable.Debt free companies don't have to pay the interest payments on the debt.Debt free profitable companies can also issue some debt if they need to, giving management some potential capital for growth or other uses. Companies can take on a certain level of debt depending on their EBITDA. Some companies with relatively stable and predictable cash flows can take on more debt than other companies with less stable and predictable cash flows. The amount of debt a company can take on is also affected by where the economy is in the economic cycle. If the economy is in a more uncertain period, companies may not be able to take on as much debt as if the economy were in an expansionary phase.Economic CycleCurrently, it isn't clear where the economy is in the economic cycle. While unemployment is low and the U.S. economy is expanding, the Federal Reserve is raising interest rates.Furthermore, there has been a recent bank failure.On March 9 and March 10, the S&P 500 fell on both days given Silicon Valley Bank's troubles which led to the FDIC to close the bank on Friday. Previously, Silicon Valley Bank was the 16th largest bank in the United States that served numerous Silicon Valley companies and startups.After the collapse, the White House said economic reforms after the Great Recession will help mitigate the systemic risk as a result of Silicon Valley Bank's failure.Chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers Cecilia Rouse said, ""Our banking system is in a fundamentally different place than it was, you know, a decade ago. The reforms that were put in place back then really provide the kind of resilience that we’d like to see.""Nevertheless, the market is more cautious now than before as investors watch for any signs of broader financial contagion.One main reason why Silicon Valley Bank failed was the substantially higher interest rates which the bank was not well positioned to handle. Given the Federal Reserve will likely increase interest rates even further this year, there could be more stress on the financial system that will have to also deal with Silicon Valley Bank's failure and also potentially an economic slowdown.In this time of uncertainty, owning quality companies with more financial flexibility and competitive advantages could be less risky than owning similar companies with a lot of debt.Given all the uncertainties, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of leading blue chip companies across many different sectors.vichie81/Shutterstock.comMethodologyFor our list of 11 Best Debt Free Stocks to Buy, we selected 11 stocks with competitive advantages that either have a debt to equity ratio of 0 according to FINVIZ.com or that essentially have no net debt given their enterprise value is lower than their market capitalization.There are different definitions of enterprise value so under some calculations, some of the companies on our list could potentially be considered as having some debt. Nevertheless, generally, the companies on this list are basically net debt free.We ranked each stock based on the number of hedge funds in our database of 943 funds that owned shares of the same stock at the end of Q4.Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 29T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:TROW) is a leading investment manager that has a debt to equity ratio of 0 according to FINVIZ.com. As of February 28, the company had preliminary AUM of $1.31 trillion, down slightly from preliminary AUM of $1.35 trillion at January 31. On Friday, shares of T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:TROW) also fell along with many other leading financial stocks given the FDIC closed down Silicon Valley Bank.Given the near term uncertainty as a result of interest rate increases, a potential economic slowdown, and the recent closure of Silicon Valley Bank, T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:TROW) could have more downside in the near term. Nevertheless, T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:TROW) has a quality business that could benefit if the broader market grows in the long term which could mean more revenue from more AUM. As of March 10, shares trade for a forward P/E ratio of 14.39 and have a dividend yield of 4.65%.Alongside Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:TROW) is a net debt free stock that's owned by many hedge funds in our database at the end of Q4.Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 42Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) is a leading Mexican burrito restaurant chain that has a debt to equity ratio of 0 according to FINVIZ.com. Given Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) also doesn't franchise and the company has more global expansion opportunities, the company arguably has more flexibility than many other restaurant chains. That being said, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) has a forward P/E ratio of 30.36 which is a fairly premium valuation for the company. If the economy slows, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) could have downside in the near term. In the long term, however, the company has potential given it could increase the number of its store locations fairly significantly.Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 46Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 47Paychex, Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX) is a leading payroll service provider that has a strong balance sheet. As of November 30, 2022, the company had cash, restricted cash, and total corporate investments of $1.3 billion and short-term and long-term borrowings, net of debt issuance costs of $808 million. For the quarter ended November 30, 2022, Paychex, Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX)'s total sales rose 7% year over year to $1.19 billion and the company's adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 9% year over year to $0.99. As of March 10, Paychex, Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX) has a forward P/E ratio of 23.79 and a dividend yield of 2.93%.Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 49BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) is a leading asset manager with a debt to equity ratio of 0 according to FINVIZ.com. Like many other leading financial stocks, shares of BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) declined on Friday given the financial sector headwinds as a result of the recent closure of Silicon Valley Bank. Currently, it isn't clear what the exact effect the closure will have on the financial system. If there is an economic slowdown and broader market weakness as a result of the closure and more Federal Reserve interest rate increases, BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK)'s AUM could come under further pressure. Nevertheless, BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) has long term growth potential if the broader market recovers in the long term. 49 hedge funds in our database owned shares of BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) at the end of Q4, ranking the stock #7 on our list of 11 Best Debt Free Stocks to Buy.Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 51Deckers Outdoor Corporation (NYSE:DECK) is a footwear, apparel, and accessories maker that has a debt to equity ratio of 0 according to FINVIZ.com. Given it is a consumer cyclical, demand for Deckers Outdoor Corporation (NYSE:DECK)'s products could potentially slow if the economy slows in the near term. As a result, the company could have near term downside. In the long term, however, analysts expect EPS growth for Deckers Outdoor Corporation (NYSE:DECK). Specifically, they expect earnings of $18.54 per share for FY2023, $21.85 per share for FY2024, and $25.85 for FY2025. For FY2022, analysts expected earnings of $15.06 per share.Like Deckers Outdoor Corporation (NYSE:DECK), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Meta Platforms, Inc.

EA,Electronic Arts Inc. (NASDAQ:EA) Q3 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Actual events and results may differ materially from our expectations. We refer you to our most recent Form 10-Q for a discussion of risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed today. Electronic Arts makes these statements as of today, January 31, 2023, and disclaims any duty to update them. During this call, the financial metrics, with the exception of free cash flow, will be presented on a GAAP basis. All comparisons made in the course of this call are against the same period in the prior year unless otherwise stated. Now, I'll turn the call over to Andrew.Our player network also continues to grow, now over 650 million. While we delivered for our players and engagement was strong in the quarter, the macro environment remained challenging and impacted Q3 results. During the quarter we took measured action to reduce our expenses, and we continue to exercise cost discipline, further focusing our investments in key areas of growth. As we navigate the short-term, we remain focused on what fuels our business: delivering high quality entertainment and driving strong engagement across our global network. The passion and enthusiasm for interactive entertainment continues to grow. For more and more people around the world, games are a cherished and authentic way to stay connected with the people they care about, build community, and find joy through shared experiences.Across all of entertainment, people are diving deeper and engaging further with their favorite franchises. EA SPORTS FIFA is at the heart of global football culture, and once again we delivered strong engagement in Q3 across our entire ecosystem. Year-to-date net bookings from our FIFA franchise has grown 4% or 15% at constant currency. FIFA 23 is pacing to be the biggest title in franchise history, delivering record engagement in Q3. In North America alone unit sales are up over 50% year-over-year. FIFA Mobile engagement was up triple digits in Q3, and FIFA Online in Asia is hitting the highest monthly active users in years. This engagement fueled strong financial performance. We have incredible momentum in our global football ecosystem. For 30 years we've been leaders in interactive football and collaborated with the most extensive network of partners spanning the globe.Our games are interwoven with the fabric of football fandom, averaging 300 million hours of gameplay every month. We are unbelievably excited to take this energy into the future with our EA SPORTS FC brand, where we'll deliver even more for fans as part of an expanding experience with endless ways to play, watch, create and connect through their love of football. Madden NFL is the world's preeminent interactive American football experience and one of the most powerful franchises in sports. We continue to invest in innovation to drive engagement and growth across this mega-franchise. Madden NFL 23 had a solid holiday quarter driven by Ultimate Team, and Madden NFL Mobile launched a new season and multiple in-game events further powering engagement.With big moments ahead, like Super Bowl LVII and Team of The Year, Madden NFL will continue to entertain millions of fans. Our EA SPORTS & Racing teams are the best in the business. The convergence of sport and entertainment is picking up pace. Through our investments in technology and new experiences, we will continue to push the boundaries and blur the lines between the digital and physical by empowering players to come together, express their fandom, and build online communities, both in and around our games. Our owned IP franchises are some of the most deeply engaging and culturally relevant entertainment properties in the world, with mega-franchises like Apex Legends and The Sims. Apex Legends has historically had a quieter Q3 as the live service model ebbs and flows against a seasonally crowded launch slate this time of the year.Photo by JESHOOTS.COM on UnsplashMoving into Q4, we're already seeing a rise in engagement as we approach the game's four-year anniversary and the launch of a new season, bringing highly anticipated updates and fresh content. Apex is one of the few IPs in its genre with proven endurance to engage and re-engage players as they play, watch, and compete. The Sims is also evolving and growing as a live service. In Q3 we took the base game free to enter and welcomed over 10 million new players into the community, driving strong engagement. Our teams are gearing up to add more collaborative ways to further empower our community to unleash their imaginations. We have incredible opportunities ahead. To do more extraordinary things in service of our players and our people, we are making deliberate decisions and reallocating investments to prioritize our biggest growth areas, building global online communities around our biggest franchises, telling incredible interactive stories, and harnessing the power of our social ecosystem to create meaningful connections.Our teams are deeply committed to delivering incredible experiences for our players. As part of this commitment, we have made the player-first decision to move Star Wars Jedi: Survivor's launch date to April 28. The game is a creative and innovative leap forward, going further into the experience of a Jedi, delivering more content, more exploration, and more fun. Anticipation for the game is incredibly high and the Respawn team known around the world for delivering top quality entertainment is focusing on the final polish stage to enhance performance, stability, and most importantly, the player experience. Giving the team these extra few weeks to deliver the best experience for our players will not only result in a higher quality game, but puts us in a best position to grow the long-term value of the franchise.We're also making strategic decisions around two mobile titles. Apex Legends Mobile won game of the year on both iPhone and Android. Despite this strong start, the ongoing experience was not going to meet the expectations of our players. After months of working with our development partner, we have made the mutual decision to sunset this version of the game. We've learned a great deal and have plans to reimagine a connected Apex mobile experience in the future. It is through these learnings, combined with a clear franchise strategy, that we've also made the decision to stop the development of the current Battlefield mobile title. We know our community values a deeply connected ecosystem and our team is focused on delivering the best, unified cross-platform experience for our players.Everything we do is designed to inspire the world to play. As a company, our teams have demonstrated that with a culture of creativity, innovation and resilience, we can grow through transformative periods of change and lead the future of entertainment. As we look ahead, our teams remain focused and disciplined as we reshape our investments toward a future of accelerated content generation, increased direct player engagement and deeply connected ecosystems to bring more people into our global community. We are taking strategic actions to evaluate our cost structure as we navigate through the current macro environment. With our exceptional talent, our broad portfolio of amazing IP, and massive player network, we remain committed to delivering long-term value in our business.Now, I'll turn the call over to Chris.However, the performance of new games, despite strong reviews, and of the Apex franchise, was below the levels we had anticipated, reflecting the challenging market dynamics. Recognizing the softer net bookings trend, we proactively took focused measures during the quarter to reduce our costs and lessen the impact on our underlying profitability. Now let's go through the quarter in more detail. Net bookings for the third quarter were $2.3 billion, down 9% or 5% in constant currency, driven largely by a tough comp as we lap the launch of Battlefield 2042 and by Apex performance, partially offset by strength across the entire FIFA ecosystem and the launch of Need for Speed Unbound.' Madden 23 was level with a very strong quarter last year.Our life services net bookings were down 1% year-over-year or up 3% in constant currency. Growth at constant currency was driven by strength in FIFA, with rapid growth occurring in FIFA Online 4 and FIFA Mobile. On a trailing 12-month basis, live services were 75% of our business. We delivered Q3 net revenue of $1.9 billion, up 5% year-over-year. Operating expenses were down 3% year-over-year or flat on a constant currency basis, driven by lower marketing spend as we lap the Battlefield 2042 launch. Further, we reduced costs by just over $60 million by moderating our hiring and prioritizing our variable spend in the quarter. Operating cash flow in the quarter was $1.1 billion and we returned $377 million to shareholders through dividends and our ongoing share repurchase program.Now, moving to guidance. As we navigate an uncertain market, I'd like to share more context about how we set our Q4 guidance. First and most important, we expect we will continue to execute well on the two most important drivers of our long-term success and growth: strong player engagement and the production of high-quality games, like the just-released and well-reviewed Dead Space. Second, we are confident that EA SPORTS FIFA will sustain and build on the strong momentum that we exited Q3 with. And third, based on our Q3 launch results, we're taking a more measured approach for the highly anticipated Q4 launches. Next, we are committed to operational excellence and being disciplined in our investment decisions. The actions we've taken during Q3 will reduce our total H2 operating expenses by approximately $140 million.In addition, we will continue to work to prioritize, spend broadly, evaluate our real estate footprint, and focus our investments on our best long-term growth opportunities. And finally, our Q4 guidance reflects the player-first decision to shift the launch of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor to Q1-FY24. It's important to note that while it changes the timing of reported net bookings, it does not change the overall lifetime economics, nor our expectations around free cash flow for Q4 or FY24. Now, on to our guidance for the fourth quarter. We are revising our Q4 net bookings guidance to $1.675 billion to $1.775 billion, which reflects the shift of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor to Q1, our decision to sunset Apex Mobile and updated expectations based on Q3 trends, in particular for launches happening in the quarter.We expect GAAP net revenue of $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion. We expect operating expenses to be $1.075 billion to $1.085 billion for the quarter, approximately $80 million lower than our previous expectation, reflecting our ongoing efforts to prioritize and focus our investment. As a result, we expect earnings per share of $0.05 to $0.20 for the fourth quarter. This Q4 guidance results in fiscal year net bookings of $7.07 billion to $7.17 billion. We are also revising our guidance for operating cash flow as a result of the updated net bookings guidance to $1.40 billion to $1.45 billion. With capital expenditures of about $200 million, that results in free cash flow of about $1.20 billion to $1.25 billion. For further details on our fiscal 2023 guidance, including our GAAP guidance, please see our press release.Before handing it back to Andrew, I'd like to provide a few early thoughts on our fiscal 2024. As we look to next year, we see the main drivers of our business being our durable broad portfolio of live services. Our newly rebranded EA SPORTS FC franchise, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, plus additional titles we will announce in due course. Excluding the impact of FX, we expect mid-single digit growth on net bookings and low double-digit growth on underlying profitability. If rates remain unchanged from today, that would equate to mid-single digit growth for both top and bottom line. Our business is anchored by incredible brands, evergreen live services, high quality games, and a growing player network. We will be focused on our investments as we build and scale our business, all while delivering amazing experiences for our players.Now, I'll hand the call back to Andrew.","February 2, 2023 at 3:02 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/electronic-arts-inc-nasdaq-ea-210256359.html,Insider Monkey,0.0,0.0,0.1814763888888889,0.44059648268398244

EA,"Electronic Arts stock sinks as the company delays, shelves game titles","Yahoo Finance tech editor Daniel Howley joins the Live show to discuss Electronic Arts' falling shares as the gaming developer continues to announce delays for its landmark titles and mobile games.Electronic Arts also announcing a delay. This was late yesterday of Star Wars Jedi Survivor from March to late April. Overall, look, that whole gaming sector has been just pounded coming out of the pandemic when you saw people staying at home, playing more games, dramatic increase like a lot of tech companies, although they didn't bounce back the way big tech has. Gaming looks like a tough road ahead.It was in negative territory. It was off about 7%, but comparing that to the losses that we saw in Take-Two, clearly just a drop in the bucket there. In terms of the loss that we're seeing today, the worst one day performance that we have seen in EA since February 2019. You talk about gaming, you talk about the fact that the consumers are pulling back on their spending.Many of these companies have been under a tremendous amount of pressure now for quite some time. And that drop today puts it just around $116 a share, flirting with that $100 level, which we know is so critical here for that company. But Dave, when you take into account that consumers are pulling back, I think the big question is where that growth is going to come from and where not only gaming is positioned in all this, but all of those consumer-facing names.And largely speaking, that whole gaming sector has been left behind. And you're seeing that in some of the chip stocks early on as well. Dan Howley, do you want to chime in on this, my friend, on terms of Electronic Arts moving forward, cutting a couple of mobile games, delaying that Star Wars game, and the road ahead for EA?One of their big games, ""Skull and Bones,"" was also delayed again, something that they've had happened before. And so this is going to be something that I think is going to hound the gaming industry going forward. The good side of this is, at least not necessarily for EA, but for gaming in general, is that, look, Sony says that PlayStations are available now, not necessarily good for them. There was a report that the PlayStation VR2 isn't getting as much love as people had hoped.There's not as many people signing up for it. Sony basically said that's not true. People still want it. Microsoft doing relatively well. But they're not putting out enough games that people necessarily want. We're still waiting on some big names from them. I think I read yesterday someone was like, we've given Microsoft the benefit of the doubt for too long in gaming now.","February 1, 2023 at 3:24 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/electronic-arts-stock-sinks-company-212411013.html,Yahoo Finance Video,-0.25,0.2,-0.02593267166437899,0.4706155632984901

EA,Electronic Arts Cancels Secret Apex Legends Game in Development,"(Bloomberg) -- Electronic Arts Inc. canceled a game based on the popular Apex Legends and Titanfall franchises, according to three people familiar with the matter.The game, which hadn’t been publicly announced, was in production at EA developer Respawn Entertainment. On Tuesday, EA, one of the world’s biggest video game publishers, gave a disappointing outlook for revenue in the current quarter. The company said it was canceling the Apex Legends mobile game as well as a mobile version of Battlefield and shuttered Industrial Toys, the studio behind it. EA also delayed the highly anticipated Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, another title in development at Respawn. Management informed the unnamed game’s team of about 50 people that EA will try to find positions for them within the company. Anyone who can’t be placed will be given severance packages and laid off, according to the people familiar with the matter, who asked to speak anonymously because they were not authorized to speak to the press. An EA spokesperson declined to comment.Most Read from BloombergTwin Quakes Kill 2,000 in Turkey and Syria; Millions Lose PowerTurkey’s South Hit by a Second High-Magnitude EarthquakeUS Moves to Recover Chinese Balloon While Weighing RetaliationChina Moves From Contrite to Confrontational Over US BalloonDell to Cut About 6,650 Jobs, Battered by Plunging PC SalesThe canceled project, code-named TFL or Titanfall Legends, was a single-player game set in the universe shared by the Apex Legends and Titanfall games. It was directed by veteran designer Mohammad Alavi until he left the company in early 2022. Although the game hadn’t been advertised, EA had hinted at it several times.Fans have been clamoring for a new single-player entry in the critically acclaimed Titanfall series for several years.

EA,"Electronic Arts Falls on Weak Forecast, Star Wars Game Delay","(Bloomberg) -- Electronic Arts Inc. shares slumped after the video game maker gave a disappointing outlook for the current quarter due to a six-week delay in the release of its next highly anticipated Star Wars game.Most Read from BloombergChina Moves From Contrite to Confrontational Over US BalloonUS Downs Chinese Balloon, Prompting Protests from BeijingTrump Offers $1 Million Bond to Appeal Clinton Suit SanctionsWhat You Need to Know About the Alleged Chinese Spy Balloon Shot Down by the USFrom China to Big Sky: The Balloon That Unnerved the White HouseThe company expects net bookings, which exclude deferred sales from online purchases, of $1.68 billion to $1.78 billion in the three months ending in March. Analysts had projected $2.22 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The shares slid about 10% in extended trading.EA is pushing the launch of the next installment of one of its biggest franchises, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, to April 28 from March 17, to hit the “quality bar, provide the team the time they need, and achieve the level of polish our fans deserve,” the company said in a statement. EA will also cease development on mobile offerings for its popular Apex Legends and Battlefield franchises. Shifting the launch of the Star Wars game to the next fiscal year also prompted EA to lower its outlook for bookings for fiscal 2023.As a result of ending development of the mobile version of Battlefield, the company will shutter its Pasadena, California, mobile game studio Industrial Toys, which worked on the game. Halo co-creator Alex Seropian was a co-founder of the studio, which started in 2012 and was acquired by Electronic Arts in 2018.“As the industry has evolved and our strategy to create a deeply connected Battlefield ecosystem has taken shape, we decided to pivot from the current direction to best deliver on our vision for the franchise and to meet the expectations of our players,” an EA spokesperson said in an email.More than 60 workers may be affected by the studio closing, said two people familiar with the issue. The EA spokesperson said the company’s goal is to offer some Industrial Toys’ employees work on other projects, but declined to specify the number of jobs being cut.Last year was sluggish for the games industry due to a slow rate of new releases and the beginnings of an economic downturn. Covid-related game delays pushed several anticipated titles into 2023, including Electronic Arts’ remake of 2008 survival-horror game Dead Space. Overall spending on video game content declined 4.3% in 2022 to $184.4 billion, according to estimates from gaming analytics firm NewZoo. Several video game publishers have signaled that sales over the holiday period were weak, including Microsoft Corp., where revenue from its gaming unit fell 13% in the three months ending Dec. 31.“As market uncertainty mounted during the quarter, we took measures to protect underlying profitability,” Chief Financial Officer Chris Suh said in the statement. “We are prioritizing the player experience, directing investment to where it can have the most positive impact for our players and on growth.”Known for its sports and Star Wars games, Electronic Arts released few major titles in the second half of 2022 outside of yearly entries to its FIFA, NHL and Madden NFL series. The racing game Need for Speed Unbound, which launched in December, received little attention.Redwood City, California-based Electronic Arts also faced stiff competition for gamers’ attention in the quarter, with big holiday releases from Activision Blizzard Inc.’s Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II to Sony Interactive Entertainment’s God of War Ragnarök, according to Nick McKay, an analyst at Wedbush Securities.EA said that despite Apex Mobile’s strong start, “the ongoing experience was not going to meet the expectations of our players.” Apex Legends Mobile, a spinoff of EA’s popular battle royale shooter, will shut down on May 1, developer Respawn Entertainment said on Twitter. EA said it will stop further development of the current Battlefield mobile title too, though said it’s “hard at work at evolving Battlefield 2042, and are in pre-production on our future Battlefield experiences at our studios across the globe.”In the third quarter, net bookings fell 9%, to $2.34 billion, the biggest year-over-year decline in two years. EA reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.80, compared with projections of $3.05. In the current period, EA expects adjusted earnings per share of $1.20 to $1.40, compared with the Wall Street estimate of $2.21.The stock dropped almost 11% in extended trading after closing at $128.68 in New York. The shares have declined 3% in the past 12 months, in line with a similar decline at Activision, but better than the nearly 30% drop at Take-Two Interactive Software Inc.Many analysts expect this year to be better for the games industry and EA is already signaling a potential turnaround. Its Dead Space was the top-selling physical release in the UK in the week ending Jan. 28, according to GamesIndustry.biz.(Updates with studio closing beginning in the fourth paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekChatGPT Gets an MBAA Billionaire’s Son Battles a Turbulent WWE Over the Future of Pro WrestlingWhen Hackers Hobbled Ireland’s Hospitals, They Took Themselves Down, TooA Portuguese Manufacturer Aims to Unseat Asia in $5,000 BikesDrugstore Chains Are Anti-Abortion Groups’ Latest Target©2023 Bloomberg L.P.","January 31, 2023 at 6:14 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/electronic-arts-falls-weak-forecast-001422500.html,Bloomberg,-0.3875,0.5125,-0.018612698412698414,0.32460981240981224

This compares to year-ago revenues of $2.58 billion.

Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Electronic Arts: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future.

This move lagged the S&P 500's daily loss of 0.72%. At the same time, the Dow lost 0.86%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 1.39%.Coming into today, shares of the digital-advertising platform operator had gained 6.6% in the past month. In that same time, the Computer and Technology sector lost 1.64%, while the S&P 500 lost 0.68%.Investors will be hoping for strength from The Trade Desk as it approaches its next earnings release, which is expected to be May 10, 2023. In that report, analysts expect The Trade Desk to post earnings of $0.13 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 38.1%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $364.85 million, up 15.71% from the year-ago period.TTD's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $1.16 per share and revenue of $1.89 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +11.54% and +19.65%, respectively.Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for The Trade Desk. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate remained stagnant. The Trade Desk currently has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).Digging into valuation, The Trade Desk currently has a Forward P/E ratio of 53.81.

(NASDAQ:TTD) insiders were rewarded last week as their US$802k investment inflated to US$1.1m","While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. See our latest analysis for Trade Desk The Independent Non-Employee Director David Wells made the biggest insider purchase in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$802k worth of shares at a price of US$45.81 each. Although we like to see insider buying, we note that this large purchase was at significantly below the recent price of US$64.34. While it does suggest insiders consider the stock undervalued at lower prices, this transaction doesn't tell us much about what they think of current prices.You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!Many investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. It's great to see that Trade Desk insiders own 9.9% of the company, worth about US$3.1b. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

This change lagged the S&P 500's 0.09% gain on the day. At the same time, the Dow added 0.2%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 4.87%.Heading into today, shares of the digital-advertising platform operator had gained 2.88% over the past month, outpacing the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 0.98% and lagging the S&P 500's gain of 3.31% in that time.Investors will be hoping for strength from The Trade Desk as it approaches its next earnings release. In that report, analysts expect The Trade Desk to post earnings of $0.13 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 38.1%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $363.74 million, up 15.35% from the year-ago period.TTD's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $1.16 per share and revenue of $1.88 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +11.54% and +19.24%, respectively.Any recent changes to analyst estimates for The Trade Desk should also be noted by investors. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection remained stagnant.

TTD,"The Trade Desk, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTD) is favoured by institutional owners who hold 70% of the company","Significantly high institutional ownership implies Trade Desk's stock price is sensitive to their trading actions51% of the business is held by the top 10 shareholdersBecause institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Trade Desk. See our latest analysis for Trade Desk Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Trade Desk. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Trade Desk's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.Institutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Trade Desk. Baillie Gifford & Co. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 9.7% of shares outstanding. With 9.3% and 8.3% of the shares outstanding respectively, Jeffrey Green and The Vanguard Group, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders. Jeffrey Green, who is the second-largest shareholder, also happens to hold the title of Chief Executive Officer.On further inspection, we found that more than half the company's shares are owned by the top 10 shareholders, suggesting that the interests of the larger shareholders are balanced out to an extent by the smaller ones.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.The definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.With a 20% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Trade Desk. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated. This may not be consistent with full year annual report figures.","April 23, 2023 at 6:00 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trade-desk-inc-nasdaq-ttd-110018856.html,Simply Wall St.,0.0,0.0,0.16856787743506496,0.4750852272727273

TTD,"The Trade Desk, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:TTD) Stock Has Seen Strong Momentum: Does That Call For Deeper Study Of Its Financial Prospects?","Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. View our latest analysis for Trade Desk Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Trade Desk is:2.5% = US$53m ÷ US$2.1b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.03 in profit.We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.It is hard to argue that Trade Desk's ROE is much good in and of itself. Even when compared to the industry average of 13%, the ROE figure is pretty disappointing. Although, we can see that Trade Desk saw a modest net income growth of 9.6% over the past five years. Therefore, the growth in earnings could probably have been caused by other variables. Such as - high earnings retention or an efficient management in place.Next, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Trade Desk's growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 6.1% in the same period, which is great to see.Trade Desk doesn't pay any dividend, meaning that all of its profits are being reinvested in the business, which explains the fair bit of earnings growth the company has seen.","April 19, 2023 at 9:00 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trade-desk-inc-nasdaq-ttd-140019298.html,Simply Wall St.,0.21666666666666665,0.36666666666666664,0.11752380952380954,0.47438095238095235

TTD,Trade Desk (NASDAQ:TTD) Is Reinvesting At Lower Rates Of Return,"For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Trade Desk:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities) Check out our latest analysis for Trade Desk In terms of Trade Desk's historical ROCE movements, the trend isn't fantastic. Around five years ago the returns on capital were 25%, but since then they've fallen to 4.8%. Although, given both revenue and the amount of assets employed in the business have increased, it could suggest the company is investing in growth, and the extra capital has led to a short-term reduction in ROCE. If these investments prove successful, this can bode very well for long term stock performance.On a related note, Trade Desk has decreased its current liabilities to 46% of total assets. That could partly explain why the ROCE has dropped. What's more, this can reduce some aspects of risk to the business because now the company's suppliers or short-term creditors are funding less of its operations. Some would claim this reduces the business' efficiency at generating ROCE since it is now funding more of the operations with its own money. Keep in mind 46% is still pretty high, so those risks are still somewhat prevalent.While returns have fallen for Trade Desk in recent times, we're encouraged to see that sales are growing and that the business is reinvesting in its operations. And the stock has done incredibly well with a 1,159% return over the last five years, so long term investors are no doubt ecstatic with that result. So while investors seem to be recognizing these promising trends, we would look further into this stock to make sure the other metrics justify the positive view.","March 27, 2023 at 9:09 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trade-desk-nasdaq-ttd-reinvesting-150956443.html,Simply Wall St.,0.0,0.0,0.18605538140020905,0.5472953674677812

The valuation is a bit rich, but this is one to buy on the dips.Source: Tada Images / Shutterstock.comJust this week, the company delivered a robust earnings report. Earnings and revenue topped analysts’ expectations, while management’s first-quarter and full-year revenue outlook topped consensus expectations.While the stock has rallied quite a bit off the low, up about 53%, I believe we can look to buy the dips in this name. That’s as shares are still 40% off the high. Shares currently trade at about 30 times this year’s earnings.

TTD,"What Does The Trade Desk, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:TTD) Share Price Indicate?"," See our latest analysis for Trade Desk According to my valuation model, Trade Desk seems to be fairly priced at around 11.34% above my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Trade Desk today, you’d be paying a relatively fair price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $49.77, then there isn’t really any room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. Although, there may be an opportunity to buy in the future. This is because Trade Desk’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company’s shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.Future outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Trade Desk's earnings over the next few years are expected to double, indicating a very optimistic future ahead. This should lead to stronger cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.","March 2, 2023 at 6:02 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/does-trade-desk-inc-nasdaq-120201116.html,Simply Wall St.,0.0,0.0,0.17310344827586208,0.4993103448275862

ZG,8 Famous Companies That Arent Profitable,"What's keeping them in business is their potential for growth and investors who believe that future gains later are better than money in hand now. They're sacrificing profits today, the bulls believe, to invest for success down the road.The bears, on the other hand, would just feel better if they saw some black ink.Everyone can be an at-home chef thanks to Blue Apron, the grocery delivery and recipe service established in 2012. The company went public in 2017 with a valuation of $1.9 billion -- but it was an up-and-down ride until the pandemic sent demand for in-home cooking subscriptions soaring. A COVID-19-inspired mega-bump in subscriptions allowed Blue Apron to briefly introduce itself to profitability, according to the Wall Street Journal, but the greeting was brief.Blue Apron always had high marketing costs, always struggled to attract new customers, and always had trouble retaining the customers it already had. In addition, Blue Apron had to deal with an increasingly competitive market space as more and more meal-delivery services sprang up in the late 2010s -- HelloFresh and Sunbasket are hot on Blue Apron's tail. According to Coresight Research, meal-kit companies enjoyed growth of 70% in 2020. But that rate slowed as restaurants returned to peak capacity, down to 20% in 2022, according to The Business Research Company. If Blue Apron couldn't cling to a fleeting profit during the best of times, the future is uncertain.Direct-to-consumer mattress brand Casper was established in 2013 and quickly attracted big-name investors like Leonardo DiCaprio, Ashton Kutcher and 50 Cent. The company went public on Feb. 5, 2020, with a valuation of $476 million, according to Crunchbase. Casper stated in its filing that it wouldn't be profitable any time soon, Forbes reported. But a few months later in August, the Wall Street Journal reported that Casper had announced that it expected to turn a profit in mid-2021.Mid-2021 came and went, and Casper failed to keep its promise. On Aug. 10, shareholders punished the stock with a bruising selloff of more than 14% when the company announced it would now not turn a profit until 2022. The company has yet to disclose its net loss for the full year 2022. Like so many other businesses in so many other segments of the economy, Casper had fallen victim to supply chain woes, labor inflation and the rising cost of raw materials, according to Seeking Alpha.Ride-sharing app Lyft was founded in 2012 and became a publicly traded company in March 2019. With a valuation of $24 billion at its IPO, stocks opened at $72 a share. The stock value has dropped significantly since then, with the current value hovering around $10.The last time Lyft's operations generated positive cash flow was the third quarter of 2019, according to TechCrunch. But when using the EBITDA format -- a stricter way of calculating profitability that's preferred by tech startups -- Lyft was in the black the last three quarters in a row. And anyway, the company is sitting on $2 billion in growth-supporting cash.Peloton went public in 2019, seven years after its founding. It was valued at $8.1 billion at the time of its IPO.Although Peloton's CEO John Foley repeatedly stated that his fitness company was profitable, the numbers revealed in its IPO filing tell a different story -- and it remained that way until the pandemic.When gyms across the country closed, Peleton became an early and obvious winner in the pandemic. In September 2020, the Wall Street Journal reported that the company had just posted its first-ever quarterly profit -- but management wouldn't make a habit of it. Just one month later in November, according to Seeking Alpha, the company announced it was continuing its march toward 100%-plus growth into 2021, which could 0nly come at the expense of profits. Indeed, the downward trend has continued. Peloton had a total net loss of $2.83 billion in 2022, according to Business of Apps.Pinterest fell from its high of around $90 per share earlier in 2021 to its current $20ish -- but it might soon actually turn a profit. In June 2021, Yahoo reported that the company was essentially operating at break-even. Its analysts speculated that Pinterest was nearing the point where Facebook was when it first began amassing profits and that Pinterest would likely start doing the same thing soon itself. But at the close of Q4 2022, Pinterest reported net losses of $96 million.When Snap Inc. went public in 2017, it was valued at $24 billion -- the biggest initial public offering in years, the Financial Times reported. However, years later, the company is still not profitable. In April 2019, a Financial Times analysis calculated that the company would run out of funds in three years if that didn't change.Like so many other companies on this list, Snap had long prioritized growth over profitability, according to Crunchbase. Today, it's experiencing strong revenue growth that is impressing both investors and Wall Street alike, according to Investor's Business Daily.  That, however, is no guarantee. At the end of 2020, Nasdaq reported that Snap still wasn't profitable three years after its IPO and was still three years away from breaking even. But in 2022, even though revenue continued to grow, Snap reported a loss of $1.4 billion.WeWork co-founder Adam Neumann set out to change the way people work by establishing collaborative co-working spaces catering to younger workers. He also had plans to expand the brand to residential and educational spaces, too. Then, the company's failed IPO filing in August 2019 threw a wrench in the gears -- but the worst was yet to come.By July 2019, WeWork was losing $219,000 every hour, the Financial Times reported. The company's disastrous attempt to go public resulted in a management shakeup -- and then the pandemic came. The virus closed offices around the world, suffocating the company's shared-workspace business model. WeWork lost 30% of its customers, according to The Guardian, as revenues were cut in half and losses topped $2.1 billion. Even so, at the start of 2021, the company's CEO announced that WeWork was on track to be profitable by the end of the year. But losses have continued to mount. The company ended 2021 with $4.6 billion in losses, and 2022 with $2.3 billion in losses.Zillow was founded in 2005 and went public in 2011. At the time of its IPO, Zillow's valuation was $540 million with an initial share price of $20, according to Crunchbase. Now, shares are worth around $40.In February 2020, Zillow announced it was moving away from its core business and moving toward a new model of buying houses directly from sellers and flipping them to new buyers. That kind of ambition requires a profit-gobbling level of investment, particularly considering that the first thing the new project did was lose millions of dollars, according to CNN Business.One year later in February 2021, however, Zillow posted not just a profit, but its highest profit ever thanks to demand from a red-hot housing market. But in August, Barron's reported that Zillow's commitment to investing in the business was still hampering profits on the year. In 2022, they reported a net loss of $72 million.More From GOBankingRates5 Expensive Renovations Homeowners Always RegretFinancial Insight in Your Inbox: Sign Up for GBR's Daily Newsletter3 Ways to Recession Proof Your Retirement7 Things You Must Do To Create a Plan for Your Money","May 8, 2023 at 7:00 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/8-famous-companies-aren-t-120001206.html,GOBankingRates,0.5,1.0,0.04504019484788716,0.3062463391309545
ZG,"A heartbreaking truth for single Americans: US renters pay a singles tax of up to $19,500 heres how to feel financially secure even when you're on you...","Living alone has its perks. You get to watch what you want on TV, there are no timetable tussles for the shower, and no one steals your leftovers from the fridge.But flying solo comes at a cost.According to a Forbes survey, 93% of U.S. singles feel the burden of the “singles tax” and 1 in 3 respondents admitted to staying in a relationship longer for the financial benefits.Nationwide, singles pay nearly $7,000 extra per year to live alone in a one-bedroom apartment — but don’t despair, there are ways to turn use that independence to your financial advantage.The size of the so-called ""singles tax"" — how much more you pay per year compared to a couple living in the same apartment — varies widely depending on your local real estate market.Other cities sucking the savings out of single Americans include San Francisco, with a $14,000 singles tax for a one-bedroom apartment, San Jose ($12,401), San Diego ($11,774) and Boston ($11,546).Zillow found that, compared to renters living solo, couples save an average of $14,000 by cohabitating. In the most expensive areas, like New York City and San Francisco, couples can save up to $39,000 or $28,227, respectively.In January, renters in apartments and single-family homes paid 8.6% more than they would have 12-months ago, according to the National Association of Realtors (NAR). The monthly rent change was 0.7% or 8.8% on an annualized basis.But some believe rent relief is on the way.However, Zillow’s home trends expert Amanda Pendleton urged renters to be cautious.“Even though rent prices are starting to cool, they are still significantly higher than they were a year ago,” she said. “Renters considering going solo this year must decide how valuable living alone is to them, and if the cost is worth it.”If you do opt for the single lifestyle, here are some steps you can take to shore up your financial security.If you're carrying a balance, paying down debt should be a top priority.Keeping an emergency fund with about three month's worth of money — including all expenses like rent, bills, groceries, loan payments, car expenses and so on — is important to becoming financially secure.This article provides information only and should not be construed as advice.

ZG,Hate Your New House? Heres How To Sell It Quickly and Easily,"So, what can you do if you hate your new house and want to sell it quickly?First, Zillow recommends cleaning and decluttering, especially if you’re short on time to sell.Staging the house is also crucial. According to Zillow, 48% of recent buyers said having the home staged is “extremely, very or somewhat important to their home-buying decision.”In addition, Zillow notes that 22% of sellers who make improvements to the home sell above list price, compared with 16% of sellers who don’t.In terms of improvements you might undertake, painting the home’s interior is the most common update sellers engage in (36% of those polled said so), followed by landscaping the yard (29%), replacing or repairing carpeting or flooring (26%) and making improvements to the bathroom (26%).The most common options are selling “for sale by owner” (FSBO) or with a real estate agent. Zillow points out that in bypassing an agent, you will save on the commission. However, hiring an agent will likely save you some headaches and will streamline the process — which in the end might result in a faster sale.Another strategy is to sell to an investor, which could also save you time as “you can expect a quicker close, an as-is sale and an all-cash offer,” Zillow notes. However, beware of scams and make sure you conduct proper research before considering this avenue.You could also sell to a so-called iBuyer (instant buyer), which is a company that uses technology to make an offer on your home instantly, according to Opendoor.Realtor.com explains that, usually, you will receive a cash offer within 24 hours on your home when selling to an iBuyer. There are downsides, however, namely that you might make less money on the sale.If you’re in a hurry to sell your house, Zillow recommends you set a timeline to lower your price if you don’t receive any offers.“The longer your home is on the market, the lower your odds are of selling it for listing price,” Zillow notes.Alternatively, offer to sweeten the deal with additional repairs or included appliances.Interestingly, Zillow says that homes listed on a Thursday sell faster and are more likely to sell above list price than those listed on any other day of the week. On the other hand, Sunday is the worst day to list for a quick sale, as homes listed on that day tend to stay on the market for 8 days longer than homes listed on Thursdays.March is statistically the best month to list a property if you want to sell quickly, while July is the best month to list a property if you want to maximize profit.Zillow says it recommends listing your home for sale in March (or during the summer), but no later than Labor Day.More From GOBankingRatesHouses in These Cities Are Suddenly BargainsGet Top Travel Tips To Help You Save More3 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000Have a Favorite Small Business?

ZG,25 Best Places in the US To Live on a Fixed Income,"Living on a fixed income basically means you're solely or almost entirely dependent on funds such as Social Security, pensions and inheritance, with little to no flexibility in the amount you're paid each month. Unstable costs, such as a volatile housing market, can be especially challenging to deal with on a fixed income.Nestled along the Hudson River, Troy saw housing prices rise 7.16% from January 2022 to January 2023. Rent prices grew about the same to a median of $1,329 per month. But by New York standards. Troy is fairly affordable for those on a fixed income. The median home value of $235, 955 fell well below the national average of $328,111, and prices are slowing down, rising only 0.07% in the interval from October 2022 to January 2023.Coraopolis is a western suburb of Pittsburgh, near the airport if you expect visits from out-of-state relatives and friends. Rent prices increased 3.46% year over year, but at $1,398, they're still well below the national average of $1,970. Median home prices went up 5.41% in  the past year but less than 1% over the past quarter to $270,816.Pictured: Pittsburgh, PennsylvaniaIf you're thinking of renting instead of buying a home, consider Marion, a suburb of Cedar Rapids. The median rent of $809 is the lowest of the 25 cities in the GOBankingRates study, although it did rise 6.78% over the past year. That's almost identical to the increase in home prices, which rose to $253,157 in the past year but went up only about $300 in the past quarter.Pictured: Cedar Rapids, IowaRent prices in Saint Cloud went up by 9.20% over the past year, one of the highest increases in the study. However, the price grew to $1,219, which still is more than $700 a month less than the national average. The median home value went up just 0.01% over the last quarter to $224,822 in Saint Cloud, which is a little more than an hour northwest of the Twin Cities.Wauwatosa sits on the shores of Lake Michigan, about 100 miles north of Chicago. It's other distinction? With a median home value of $322,992, Wauwatosa is the most expensive place to buy a home in the GOBankingRates study. But the prices didn't skyrocket over the past year, going up 5.96%. Rents didn't go up quite as much, rising just over 5% a median of $1,538 per month. While it's one of the higher rental prices in the study, it's still $400 less than the national average.Pictured: Milwaukee, WisconsinIn the Oklahoma City suburb of Yukon, housing prices skyrocketed in the first three quarters of 2022, then barely moved a trickle in the final quarter. Median home values went up 10.03% from January 2022 to January 2023, making it the highest jump in the study, with the price settling at $242,829. Maybe the rush to buy accounted for an increase in rental costs of less than 2% to $1,507.Pictured: Oklahoma City, OklahomaIowa City is the second Iowa locale on the list, but it's costlier than its suburb of Marion. The median home price in Iowa City is just under $300,000, making it the fourth most expensive place to buy a house in the study. The value went up 5.27% year over year, a half-percentage point higher than the increase in rent. A rental in Iowa City is $1,218 per month, well under the national average.Real estate prices in Wheeling, which is about 30 miles northwest of Chicago, increased just 3.25% year over year to $268,919. Rent prices had more than triple of an increase, however, going up 10.99% to $1,766 per month - one of the two highest rents in the study.Pictured: Buffalo Grove, IllinoisStillwater's median home value of $216,714 put in the bottom third of prices in the study. The year-over-year increase in housing prices was far less than then 8.66% increase in rental prices to $1,283.Home values in Dover went up 9.32% year over year, with a median home value of $$292,334. The increase in rental prices over the same time span, however, was a scant 1.24% to an average of $1,507 per month.Home prices in Pittsburgh were flat over the span from October to January, rising only 0.19% to $212,105. The year-over-year housing prices rose 5.35%, however, less than the 6.06% hike in rent prices to an average of $1,403 per month.Lakewood, a suburb of Cleveland near Lake Erie, is an affordable option. Zillow puts the median home price at $262,198. That's up only 2.75% year over year. The average rent is $1,262 a month, up 4.93% year over year.New York's state capital sits on the west side of the Hudson River, and you'll pay more to live there than in Troy, on the east side. Albany's home values went north by 4.52% over the past year to $261,619, but that is still about $40,000 less than the national median. Rents went up nearly 7% to $1,475 per month.Cedar Rapids is the third Iowa city on the list - and it has the least expensive home prices of the Iowa locales. The median home value in Cedar Rapids went up 6.64% to $191,262, one of the six cities on the list with housing prices less than $200,000. The average rent also is affordable at $952, despite going up 5.25% year over year.The three Iowa cities seemed like a lot for this study, but apparently Maryland is the best state to live on a fixed income. Parkville, a northeastern suburb of Baltimore, has median home values of just less than $250,000, which rose almost 4% over the past year. Rental prices grew 4.78% to $1,464 per month.Huber Heights, on the western side of the state, is a good place for homeowners on a fixed income, with Zillow reporting median home prices of $167,425. That represents a 6.43% hike year over year, but costs were flat in the last quarter. Rental costs went up less - 4.80% -- to $1,251 per month.Pictured: Dayton, OhioIf you thought living in Huber Heights offered affordability on a fixed income, look at Euclid in the Cleveland area. Home values in Euclid are the lowest in the GOBankingRates study at $129,550, which even includes a 5.87% increase year over year. Rents only went up 2.90%, but they are far from the cheapest on the list at a median of $1,229.Pictured: Cleveland, OhioThe median home value in Bossier City is just a few hundred dollars below $200,000, making it one of the best places to live on a fixed income. Still, housing prices jumped by 7.05% in the last year. The 2.15% increase in rent, to $1,287 per month, was minuscule by comparison.In Manhattan, the location of Kansas State University, the median home value is $242,257, up 4.52% year over year. The average rent had a lesser increase, up 2.89% to $1,220.Homebuyers on a fixed income can benefit from San Angelo's relatively stable housing market: Home values increased only 2.14% year over year to $189,987. Rent rose 5.66% to an average of $1,302.The median home value in West Springfield is $275,707. Although this is nearly $12,000 below the national median value, it's much less than the median home price in the state of Massachusetts as a whole, which is $508,232, according to Zillow.Home values in the city increased about 10.81% year over year.Pictured: Baltimore, Maryland Home and rent prices are both well below the national median in Beaumont. The median home value in the city is $146,934 and rent is $1,331. The home values rose by just 1.94%, and rents went up 2.97% year over year.Here comes the run on Maryland cities to close out the study, and all three share a common fact. Rent prices went down from January 2022 to 2023. In Middle River, rents fell 0.58% to $1,591. The median home price, however, rose 4.56% to $287,493.Pictured: Baltimore, Maryland Housing costs in Windsor Mill are about $50,000 below the U.S. median at $279,100. Home values showed nearly a 4.74% growth year over year, while rents fell by 0.77 to $1,505.Pictured: Baltimore, Maryland Randallstown, 20 miles from Baltimore, is a study in contrasts. While its housing prices are second highest in the study at $322,342 and went up 3.53 percent year over year, rental prices dropped 3.3% in the same time span. Median rents now are $1,427 - more than $500 below the national average.Pictured: Baltimore, Maryland More From GOBankingRates5 Expensive Renovations Homeowners Always RegretFinancial Insight in Your Inbox: Sign Up for GBR's Daily Newsletter3 Ways to Recession Proof Your Retirement7 Things You Must Do To Create a Plan for Your MoneyMethodology: To find the best places in the United States to live on a fixed income, GOBankingRates first looked at every city with Zillow home value data for January 2022, October 2022, and January 2023 available as well as the city's rent for both January 2022 and 2023 as sourced from Zillow. With all these data points sourced GOBankingRates then pared the list to only include cities that met the following criteria: a home value of less than the national average of $328,111 and also a ranking as one of the 5,000 largest housing markets, according to ZillowFor these qualified cities, GOBankingRates found: (1) the quarter-over-quarter percent change in home value; (2) the year-over-year percent change in home value; and (3) the year-over-year percent change in rent. Those cities with negative values for factors (1) or (2) were then eliminated. With the remaining cities, GOBankingRates scored and combined all three factors with the lowest score being best. These factors were chosen because changes in home values serve as a proxy for measuring the volatility of a housing market, with large increases posing a threat to those living on fixed incomes, while a negative change in value means money is being lost in depreciating house values. However, decreasing rental prices benefit a household on a fixed income.All data was collected on and up to date as of March 1, 2023.Photo Disclaimer: Please note photos are for representational purposes only and may represent the nearest large metropolitan area. ","May 4, 2023 at 11:01 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/best-places-every-state-live-143100947.html,GOBankingRates+10.63%,0.4121212121212121,0.3333333333333333,0.060317998750834566,0.39364029419999585

ParkerOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of John Campbell with Stephens.John Robert CampbellJeremy WacksmanJohn Robert CampbellJeremy WacksmanOperatorThe next question is from Ryan McKeveny with Zelman.Ryan McKevenyJeremy WacksmanRyan McKevenyGot it. No, that's great. And second question maybe for Allen. I think you alluded to this in your commentary on the OpEx and mentioning the uplift with some hiring into 2Q. I guess, generally, as you do go from, let's say, test markets to the broader footprint, either with touring or just the other initiatives, generally speaking, should we expect OpEx to kind of be on an incremental trend up as more of these new initiatives are rolled out? Or do you reach a point where effectively the OpEx or the cost base you guys have just gets incrementally leveraged?Allen W. ParkerDid I lose you?Richard N. BartonNo. We hear you, Allen.Allen W. ParkerOperatorThe next question is from the line of Jamesmichael Sherman-Lewis with Citi.Ronald Victor JoseyThis is Ron. I don't know if you can hear me okay.Richard N. BartonYes, we got you, Ron.Ronald Victor JoseyRichard N. BartonRon, this is Rich. I think the -- probably, Jeremy, you're best positioned to address the higher conversion mid-funnel question, and then we'll talk about the second part. Yes.Jeremy WacksmanRichard N. BartonJeremy WacksmanOperatorOur next question is from Brad Erickson with RBC.Bradley D. EricksonSo maybe 1 or 2 more on tours. Just based on all the positive indicators going on already mentioned, how would we see tours in this case start to translate to revenue in terms of, I guess, agents finding more value and conversion from those leads and then obviously wanting to pay more? Because I guess with the 3x conversion comment you've always given, that kind of implies that agents already pay more for those leads or would. Maybe that's right or not. But if you could just talk about the mechanics and the -- kind of the process of getting paid more on that higher conversion and sort of how you see that evolving, with real-time touring in particular.Jeremy WacksmanBradley D. EricksonGot it. Maybe just one follow-up related to that then. Are you saying then that you're also -- I recognize the real-time touring, rolling it out in 4 markets, et cetera, and going presumably nationwide over time. But are you also seeing a mix of touring leads within the broader business? Is that what you're saying? Or am I not understanding that right?Jeremy WacksmanOperatorThe next question is from the line of Vincent Kardos with Jefferies.Vincent Nugent KardosThis is Vincent on for John Colantuoni at Jefferies. I have a follow-up on real-time touring as well. Is there any color you're able to provide on the impact specifically from real-time touring in your test markets that you're seeing on the cost per transaction, the rate at which Premier Agents introduce clients to Zillow Home Loan officers or the ultimate mortgage attachment rate to buyers?Jeremy WacksmanVincent Nugent KardosGot it. Got it. And then one more quick one on the financing side of the business as well as these Premier Agents, is there anything you're able to tell us at this point about kind of what you've seen as mortgage rates have started to stabilize a little bit in kind of the 6.3% to 6.4% range over the past month or 2 here?Richard N. BartonAre you seeing -- Brad, maybe? Are you seeing anything? I mean my commentary on the macro has it kind of more of the same. Brad, are you seeing anything -- how have our e-com forecasts for, say, transactions for the year changed recently? Not much, right?Bradley Allen BerningYes, not much. I think you saw out of the March quarter, we were talking about around $4.4 million, $4.5 million. For the full year, I think we're looking at like $4.3 million now. So there's been some modest changes, but relatively modest as we bounce around at these levels.Richard N. BartonWhich are low. I mean they're low levels. We've said for a couple of quarters now that we think over the next 10 years, there are going to be 60 million home transactions. And our eyes are focused on that. We're investing for that, and we want to have a meaningful and increasing percentage of those transactions happen in our sphere, so that we can monetize it and we can deliver value via the super app and many other means. So...OperatorThe next question is from Tom White with D.A. Davidson.Thomas Cauthorn WhiteRichard N. BartonWell, maybe, Jeremy, maybe you start and then Allen finish?Jeremy WacksmanRichard N. BartonDo you want to hit the marketing, too? Or Allen, do you want to hit that?Allen W. ParkerI'm happy to. Or Jeremy will hook you up.Jeremy WacksmanYes, Allen.Allen W. ParkerJeremy WacksmanYes. No, I think that's right.OperatorOur next question is from Jay McCanless with Wedbush.Jay McCanlessSorry to press on this topic, but I don't -- still not understanding. When you talk about the better-than-expected number of connections, that -- those connections weren't from a specific app or a specific process that you have there but it's more you fix the pipeline of how those leads got to the agents. And I guess the kind of the second part of that question is, if that pipeline wasn't working before, do you feel like you may have lost some business that now you'll be gaining and helping you to grow ahead of the market?Richard N. BartonJeremy, it sounds like you have a reasonable -- I mean...Jeremy WacksmanYes. I mean I guess, I think, Rich, you talked about it earlier as fixing our leaky funnel, right? It's really just...Richard N. BartonI don't like to talk about it as a leaky funnel anymore. That implies we're broke. We're like smoothing. We're getting better at converting the leads that are already in our funnel into transactions anyways.Jeremy WacksmanRichard N. BartonJay McCanlessUnderstood. All right. And then the second question I had -- and kudos on the growth in new construction. And I was wondering, you said when you were given the guidance about resi being down 10% in the midpoint, probably doing better than the overall market. Is that just Zillow's residential revenue versus existing homes? Or is there a forecast around new housing growth built in there? And if so, maybe could you talk about what you're thinking the growth rates for those 2 different types of housing would be.Bradley Allen BerningWant me to start on that, Rich?Richard N. BartonYes, yes. Sure, Brad.Bradley Allen BerningSo the existing home sale forecast that we talked about is -- we're talking about down 18% to down 28% in total transaction dollar volumes for Q2, and so our residential outperformance we talked about is versus that existing home market. That does not include, obviously, the new home market. The new home market is a smaller part of our overall business. So the part that more closely correlates with our business is the existing home sales, so that's why you see us reference that and correlate. And as we called out, the things that are driving the benefits that we see in Q1, we expect to continue into Q2.OperatorThis completes the allotted time for questions. I will now turn the call back over to Rich Barton for any closing remarks.Richard N. BartonWell, great chatting with everybody. Thanks for taking the time on this busy earnings day. You can see we feel really good about a bunch of incremental improvements adding up to good relative results, good results relative to the industry. We look forward to chatting with you soon. Thanks a lot.OperatorThis concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.","May 4, 2023 at 8:49 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/q1-2023-zillow-group-inc-134938929.html,Thomson Reuters StreetEvents,0.0,0.0,0.20938091035178413,0.4506638857367013

This compares to earnings of $0.49 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 133.33%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this online real estate marketplace would post earnings of $0.10 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.21, delivering a surprise of 110%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.Zillow , which belongs to the Zacks Internet - Services industry, posted revenues of $469 million for the quarter ended March 2023, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 11.31%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $4.26 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Zillow shares have added about 35% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 7.3%.What's Next for Zillow?While Zillow has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Zillow: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.24 on $457.1 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $1.15 on $1.83 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well.

ZG,5 big analyst picks: Comcast upgraded to Buy following super quarter | Pro Recap,"Investing.com -- Here is your Pro Recap of the biggest analyst picks you may have missed today.BofA Securities upgraded Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) to Buy from Neutral and raised its price target to $49.00 from $44.00 after a ""super"" quarter.According to BofA Securities, stronger-than-anticipated results in Content & Experiences (C&E), a net increase in broadband subscribers, and solid cost control/reductions at Connectivity & Platforms (C&P) drove the beat. The firm sees Comcast at a turning point, with promising prospects for a robust media operations turnaround, and its connectivity business enjoying low churn, substantial ARPU growth, and solid growth in Business Services.Bernstein upgraded Zillow (NASDAQ:ZG) to Market Perform from Underperform and raised its price target to $45.00 from $35.00. This follows the firm’s May 2022 coverage initiation which expressed concerns about negative revision risks in revenues and profits. Since then, revenue and adjusted EBITDA forecasts have dropped significantly.According to the firm, the easing of comps and signs of a bottomed core business have increased its optimism about Zillow's prospects. However, to warrant an Outperform rating, the firm seeks more visibility on the recovery curve and acknowledges that the revenue outlook is still uncertain and the stock isn't particularly cheap.The company is set to report its Q1/23 earnings on Wednesday after the market close.Morgan Stanley upgraded General Motors (NYSE:GM) to Overweight from Equalweight and raised its price target to $38.00 from $35.00, noting it believes the stock is “oversold” and offers an attractive risk-reward.Northland Capital Markets upgraded Power Integrations (NASDAQ:POWI) to Outperform from Market Perform with a price target of $82.00, noting it estimates strong quarter-over-quarter growth in Q2 and Q3, up 15% and 25%, respectively. “These numbers could prove to be low relative to a potential Q1 beat and Q2 raise,” added the firm.Shares gained 3% today.The company will report its Q1/23 earnings on Thursday after the market close.Stifel upgraded Scotts Miracle-Gro (NYSE:SMG) to Buy from Hold and raised its price target to $80.00 from $65.00, outlining an attractive near-term set-up for the shares with a margin recovery enabling outsized EPS growth alongside advantaged long-term growth prospects it believes are undervalued at current levels.The stock has experienced fluctuations in price, and there has been a lot of attention paid to the negative impact of weather conditions in March. While a headwind, Stifel believes the outsized attention is misplaced with April weather of greater consequence and favorable. More importantly, the firm believes the recent update on the company's leverage suggests a more robust margin outlook, providing added flexibility to achieve 2023 profit guidance.Shares rose more than 5% today.The company is set to report its Q2/23 earnings on Wednesday before the market opens.Related Articles5 big analyst picks: Comcast upgraded to Buy following ‘super quarter’ | Pro RecapWall Street near flat after First Republic news, awaiting FedMorgan Stanley to cut 3,000 jobs in second quarter - source","May 1, 2023 at 11:54 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-big-analyst-picks-comcast-165441351.html,Investing.com,0.1111111111111111,0.2888888888888889,0.15575396825396823,0.4275793650793651

GOBankingRates first found the 2022 average median list price and 2022 average median sale price for homes in each metropolitan area by averaging Zillow's monthly estimates of each figure for January through August 2022. Then, GOBankingRates calculated the (1) typical difference between the list and sale price for homes in each area in 2022. GOBankingRates then similarly analyzed Zillow's monthly estimates of other housing market metrics to find each metro area's (2) average housing market inventory in 2022, (3) 2022 average median number of days homes spent on the market, (4) 2022 average share of listings that took a price cut while on the market, and (5) 2022 average median price cut taken by homes on the market, measured as a percent of the prior list price. All cities were then scored against each other and ranked, with a larger difference between list and sale prices, larger housing market inventory, greater typical number of days spent on the market, greater share of listings taking a price cut, and larger price cuts taken indictaing places where it is more difficult to sell a home. Zillow's smoothed estimates for single family residences were used for all metrics. In the calculation of final scores, factor (2) was weighted half as heavily as all other factors.

ZG,"How Housing Market Could Look by End of 2023, According to Experts","The national median list price was $424,000 in March 2023, an increase from $415,000 in February, according to Realtor.com. The yearly growth rate of the median list price dropped to 6.3% in March — the lowest growth rate since June 2020; it was 7.8% in February.By summertime, this could mean median sale prices likely will decline relative to 2022, according to Realtor.com. In February, the national median sale price dropped on an annual basis for the first time in more than 10 years.However, the Zillow Home Value Index is 3% higher than one year ago, according to the Zillow March 2023 Market Report. Of course, this largely varies by city. In March 2023, the Zillow Home Value Index surged 8.3% in Miami and 7% in Richmond, Virginia, but declined 9.4% in San Francisco and 7.5% in Austin, Texas.So far in early spring, he said, sellers have been holding onto their properties, which is helping to stabilize home prices.“Like in big cities, many rural areas are experiencing housing shortages,” he said. “Demand in select rural areas will grow as workers continue to telecommute.”He said people also are continuing to migrate to the southern states.“I look for interesting dynamics to unfold as price points in rural areas are more attractive compared to larger urban centers areas,” he said.Ultimately, he said, housing prices at the end of 2023 will depend on where you live.“I could see further decline, albeit minimally, in the western half of the country and a slightly positive number for the eastern half. — maybe on the whole a 1% increase,” he said. “Some rural areas, especially in the Carolinas, may see growth above 1%.”He said this all depends on interest rates.“If we see them get into the 5% range, we will see sellers who have been sitting on the sidelines because of their rate put their homes on market and millions more buyers nationally also get back in,” he said. “This will fuel higher prices because the excess demand has just been waiting for an acceptable interest rate range to get back into the market.”He said the current market might look like a bubble, but it isn’t for a variety of reasons. This includes mortgage lending becoming more stringent, a decline in the popularity of adjustable-rate mortgages, low housing inventory keeping demand high and low foreclosure rates.“These trends forecast that towards the third quarter of 2023, market conditions might be better and more stable,” he said.He also noted that different areas will see different types of price changes.“Homes in rural areas are selling much faster than in 2022,” he said. “Properties in suburban and rural areas will continue to remain popular as post-Covid remote work continues to motivate buyers to prioritize space over city living.”While plenty of speculation can be done, there’s ultimately no real way to know what home prices will be by the end of 2023. If you’re waiting to make a move, keep a close eye on properties that compare to the type you’re looking to buy or sell in your area.More From GOBankingRates5 Expensive Renovations Homeowners Always RegretFinancial Insight in Your Inbox: Sign Up for GBR's Daily Newsletter3 Ways to Recession Proof Your Retirement14 Ways to Invest That Don't Involve the Stock Market","April 29, 2023 at 7:00 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/housing-market-could-look-end-180009430.html,GOBankingRates,0.0,0.0,0.11803797717434082,0.36760350255804797

ZG,Analysts Estimate Zillow Group (ZG) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for,"Zillow Group (ZG) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on May 3. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis online real estate marketplace is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.12 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -75.5%.Revenues are expected to be $423.37 million, down 90.1% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 12.42% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Zillow?For Zillow, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -4.35%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Zillow will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Zillow would post earnings of $0.10 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.21, delivering a surprise of +110%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Zillow doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Zillow Group, Inc.

ZG,Zillow CEO to face questions in rival real estate platform's lawsuit,"By Mike ScarcellaApril 26 (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Tuesday said Zillow Group Inc Chief Executive Rich Barton can be questioned in a rival real estate platform's antitrust lawsuit in Seattle federal court, over an objection that he has no material involvement in the issues in the case.U.S. District Judge Thomas Zilly said in an order that REX -Real Estate Exchange Inc could depose Barton for up to three hours in the company's lawsuit filed in 2021 accusing Zillow and National Association of Realtors (NAR) of anticompetitive business practices.Zillow's lawyers had opposed any questioning of Barton, who co-founded Zillow in 2005 and has served as CEO since 2019. Zillow reported $2 billion in revenue last year.REX's lawsuit alleged Zillow in 2021 redesigned its consumer website in concert with NAR to ""segregate, conceal and demote"" home listings that were not part of NAR's member-operated multiple listing services. They comprise the databases showing residential real estate for sale in regions across the country.The change allegedly caused views on REX's listings to ""plummet,"" the company said.REX wants to question Barton about Zillow's decision to join multiple listing services and also its move to buy houses and originate mortgages.A Zillow spokesperson on Tuesday said the company doesn't comment on pending cases, and a representative from NAR had no immediate comment.REX and its lawyers at Boies Schiller Flexner did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment.Zillow and NAR both have denied liability and are contesting claims in the lawsuit.Lawyers for Zillow dispute there was any agreement with NAR and deny that the website redesign harmed competition.Zillow's chief industry development officer was due to be questioned on Thursday, and the company's vice president of industry development has a deposition scheduled in May.The complaint is seeking unspecified monetary damages and an injunction ""from continuing to engage in any anticompetitive conduct.""A trial is scheduled for Sept. 18.The case is REX - Real Estate Exchange Inc v.

ZG,More buyers are purchasing mortgage points as a way to ease monthly costs,"15% more borrowers purchased mortgage points in 2022 than 2021, and continue to do so as interest rates hover around 6%Mortgage points, also known as discount points, are an option for buyers to pay an upfront fee to buy down the interest rate on a loan. The term ""points"" is a common way of referring to a percentage of your loan amount. When buyers choose to purchase mortgage discount points, they are essentially pre-paying interest up front in exchange for a lower rate and monthly payment.Regardless of income level, borrowers were more likely to purchase points for homes in the top and middle price tiers, than for homes in the bottom price tier. This could be because the impact of lowering interest rates is greater on more expensive mortgages.(ZFIN) SOURCE Zillow Home Loans","April 26, 2023 at 7:00 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/more-buyers-purchasing-mortgage-points-120000036.html,PR Newswire,0.5,0.5,0.1404040404040404,0.4808080808080808
ZG,"Gen Z Believes Winning the Lottery Is the Only Way To Afford a House, New Study Shows","New research from Zillow found that 52% of Gen Zers and 57% of millennials who don’t currently own a home believe they’d need to win the lottery to afford one.Since winning the lottery does not represent a sound financial plan, just about all younger Americans — 95% of Gen Zers and 94% of millennials — say they will need to make some serious life changes if they want to achieve the dream of home ownership.The Zillow survey of 2,066 U.S. adults — conducted in March and released on April 19 — found that roughly 40% of millennials said they would need to get a second or third job to afford a home right now. About 28% of Gen Zers said they’d have to make a career change in to afford one.The good news is, as of February 2023 the median sale price in the U.S. was down 1.2% from the previous year, according to Redfin. The bad news is, that median price was $386,721 — roughly 18% higher than the median sales price just three years earlier, according to Federal Reserve data.The current housing affordability crisis is the “worst it’s been in at least 15 years,” Zillow reported. Overall home values are up 3% over the past year… and that’s coming off an already high base. During the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, average home values rose by double digits.Those home values already priced many would-be buyers out of the market, and now they are being squeezed further by rising mortgage rates.“These findings highlight the gap between Gen Z and millennials’ dream of owning a home and their ability to actually make it happen,” Zillow home trends expert Amanda Pendleton said in a press release. “Mortgage rates have been on the rise since last year, sending monthly housing costs through the roof.”The typical monthly mortgage payment is now $431 higher than a year ago, Pendleton added. When you combine rising rates with record-breaking home value appreciation, “it’s easy to understand why younger generations are wondering how they’ll ever be able to afford a home,” she said.If you’re a first-time buyer looking to take the plunge this year, Zillow recommended starting out by coming up with a price you can afford. Using a mortgage calculator and affordability calculator can help you arrive at the right number.After that, Zillow advised reading reviews of realtors in your area to find out which ones get the best scores. You should also get pre-approved for a mortgage so you are ready to hit the ground running if the perfect home suddenly comes on the market.More From GOBankingRates10 Aldi Brand Products Worth BuyingLearn To Master Your Money With These Financial TipsHow to Build a Financial Plan From ZeroFinancial Insight in Your Inbox: Sign Up for GBR's Daily Newsletter","April 20, 2023 at 9:15 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gen-z-believes-winning-lottery-141533304.html,GOBankingRates,0.21212121212121213,0.7348484848484849,0.09747715247715248,0.40270547739297746

ZG,Entry-level home shoppers most likely to face bidding wars this spring,"Prices rose by 8% annually for the least-expensive one-third of houses; the most-expensive homes lost value for the first time in more than a decade.The recent uptick in inventory hasn't included the least-expensive houses — bottom-tier inventory is up just 1% from last year, compared to a 13% boost for top-tier homes.A slight annual recovery in inventory has left out entry-level shoppers. There are just 1% more homes available for sale in the bottom price tier compared to 8% and 13% more in the slower-moving middle and top tiers, respectively.In the recent past, entry-level shoppers had an easier time finding discounts than their well-heeled colleagues, but that comparative benefit is gone now, too. The share of mid- and top-tier homes that sold above list price rose far above the bottom-tier share through most of the pandemic. Super-low rates had cranked up demand for more-expensive houses. But after mortgage rates peaked at 7% last fall, the share sold above list price for all three tiers converged; now they're tracking together.United States8 %-1 %48 %33 %1 %13 %New York, NY5 %0 %34 %19 %-24 %-9 %Los Angeles, CA0 %-6 %35 %28 %-18 %2 %Chicago, IL6 %0 %40 %19 %-19 %-13 %Dallas, TX2 %-1 %44 %40 %3 %15 %Houston, TX4 %2 %41 %33 %12 %28 %Washington, DC3 %-2 %26 %22 %-32 %-3 %Philadelphia, PA8 %4 %43 %31 %-7 %-12 %Miami, FL16 %6 %64 %54 %18 %48 %Atlanta, GA6 %1 %64 %39 %-1 %9 %Boston, MA4 %-1 %34 %24 %-32 %4 %Phoenix, AZ-2 %-3 %46 %40 %1 %55 %San Francisco, CA-5 %-14 %26 %16 %-37 %2 %Riverside, CA1 %-4 %48 %34 %0 %15 %Detroit, MI5 %1 %54 %27 %9 %-2 %Seattle, WA-3 %-11 %35 %32 %-32 %6 %Minneapolis, MN1 %-1 %26 %23 %-22 %8 %San Diego, CA1 %-6 %41 %43 %-38 %-1 %Tampa, FL8 %2 %69 %51 %26 %59 %Denver, CO-1 %-5 %29 %25 %-4 %47 %Baltimore, MD8 %2 %35 %25 %-7 %-12 %St. Louis, MO8 %2 %45 %27 %2 %-1 %Orlando, FL8 %3 %53 %43 %12 %41 %Charlotte, NC7 %1 %65 %45 %30 %29 %San Antonio, TX5 %1 %43 %37 %42 %63 %Portland, OR-1 %-4 %30 %25 %-32 %11 %Sacramento, CA-3 %-7 %32 %24 %-36 %2 %Pittsburgh, PA0 %0 %45 %21 %-6 %9 %Cincinnati, OH9 %3 %52 %32 %-17 %3 %Austin, TX-6 %-8 %48 %45 %30 %95 %Las Vegas, NV0 %-5 %34 %27 %9 %38 %Kansas City, MO7 %2 %51 %31 %5 %12 %Columbus, OH8 %3 %54 %33 %-10 %16 %Indianapolis, IN6 %1 %57 %37 %8 %32 %Cleveland, OH6 %4 %47 %30 %-1 %2 %San Jose, CA-1 %-11 %31 %24 %-54 %16 %Nashville, TN6 %-1 %55 %48 %25 %67 %Virginia Beach, VA8 %3 %40 %29 %-16 %-9 %Providence, RI6 %2 %42 %35 %-34 %-13 %Jacksonville, FL7 %2 %61 %51 %49 %63 %Milwaukee, WI8 %3 %39 %21 %-32 %-21 %Oklahoma City, OK10 %4 %56 %31 %-9 %77 %Raleigh, NC4 %0 %54 %43 %2 %66 %Memphis, TN8 %2 %62 %35 %7 %36 %Richmond, VA21 %-3 %67 %21 %-12 %-8 %Louisville, KY10 %2 %47 %27 %-6 %2 %New Orleans, LA11 %-1 %34 %17 %49 %48 %Salt Lake City, UT-2 %-5 %43 %36 %6 %66 %Hartford, CT9 %5 %43 %31 %-32 %-9 %Buffalo, NY4 %2 %41 %28 %-1 %-2 %SOURCE Zillow","April 20, 2023 at 4:00 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/entry-level-home-shoppers-most-090000647.html,PR Newswire,0.25,0.75,0.18333333333333332,0.3401515151515151
ZG,Condo vs. House: Which Is the Best Investment in Your City?,"For lots of homebuyers, a big decision comes down to deciding between a condo or house. This can ultimately be determined by where you live and what’s the best financial choice if you want your home to be going up in value.Zillow 2023 median home value: $850,175Seattle might be known for the rain, but when it comes to home prices, the market is heating up. That’s because there is a high demand and short supply of housing in the city.On the other hand, Qiu suggests, investing in a house in Seattle can be a better long-term investment.“Houses in Seattle typically appreciate in value over time, and you can expect a higher return on investment compared to a condo. A house also offers more space, privacy and flexibility than a condo, making it a more attractive option for families or those who plan to live in the property.”Zillow 2023 median home value: $901,291Anywhere you go along California’s coastline, you’ll run into the same issue when it comes to buying a home: price.Ang says that in Los Angeles there is not much of a difference between houses and condos in terms of investment returns. Overall, though, Ang suggests that “condos may be the better option due their generally lower prices and higher rental yields.”Zillow 2023 median home value: $398,908With all the new construction projects Phoenix, buying a house could be the right choice when it comes to investing. However, don’t underestimate what a condo can do.“A more accessible entry point into the city’s real estate market may be provided through condos, which frequently include facilities like a fitness [center] or pool,” explains Edwards, who says that Phoenix is on par with most major cities when it comes to real estate purchasing.“Alternatively, homes offer more solitude and may have a yard or outside space. The investor’s financial situation and lifestyle preferences will ultimately determine whether to purchase a condo or a home.”Zillow 2023 median home value: $272,270While houses in Chicago may be the better investment due to lower purchase prices and solid rental yields, it is still worth exploring all factors.One other thing to take into account, according to Dowski, is school district. “It doesn’t matter if the property is great and cheap, if it’s in a bad school area, you’re not going to get anybody willing to rent it,” Dowski explains. “And if you do, you’re not going to be willing to rent to them, if you know what I mean.”Zillow 2023 median home value: $622,280Big Apple condos generally have higher rental yields, plus the draw of living in one of the biggest, most exciting cities in the world.“Houses, especially in Manhattan, are much more expensive, and most small investors cannot afford to purchase a house,” explains Shapot. “The tenant pool for houses in NYC is more limited than for condos, again because of price. But, the greater the risk, the greater the potential reward.”Zillow 2023 median home value: $213,244“In Philadelphia, I think a house is a better investment,” says Franqui. “In general, houses seem to hold their value and appreciate more than condos. Houses are typically easier to resell, as there is more demand for houses in Philadelphia.”Additionally, Franqui cites that the majority of Philadelphia renters are not renting apartments or condos, but instead, they are renting houses.“Since the start of the pandemic, houses, which provide more space and usually some outdoor space, have seemed to be in higher demand than smaller units like condos,” Franqui explains.“For the same price, a condo will typically have a higher monthly carrying cost when you factor in condo dues,” Franqui says. “The higher monthly costs often make it more challenging to cover your costs with a renter, as condos don’t necessarily command a higher rent. The main advantage to a condo is less direct maintenance, as things like roofs, common areas, etc., are a shared responsibility.”So what is the best overall investment no matter what city you live in: a condo or a house?“Condominiums, on the other hand, are subject to association fees and may have more restrictions on renovations or modifications,” Sanchez explains. “Houses typically provide greater space, privacy and flexibility. Homeowners have greater control over their property and can make changes or improvements as they see fit. Owning a house can [also] be more expensive and requires more maintenance and upkeep than a condo.”The bottom line: assess your financial goals, look at your city’s market trends and determine which long-term growth investment makes the most sense for you.More From GOBankingRates5 Expensive Renovations Homeowners Always RegretFinancial Insight in Your Inbox: Sign Up for GBR's Daily NewsletterHow to Build a Financial Plan From ZeroThe 10 Best Credit Cards for 2023","April 19, 2023 at 7:11 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/condo-vs-house-best-investment-193543869.html,GOBankingRates,1.0,0.3,0.17796943078496483,0.44756801720393957

ZG,"Some Confidence Is Lacking In Zillow Group, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:ZG) P/S"," See our latest analysis for Zillow Group While the industry has experienced revenue growth lately, Zillow Group's revenue has gone into reverse gear, which is not great. One possibility is that the P/S ratio is high because investors think this poor revenue performance will turn the corner. If not, then existing shareholders may be extremely nervous about the viability of the share price.Zillow Group's P/S ratio would be typical for a company that's expected to deliver very strong growth, and importantly, perform much better than the industry.Retrospectively, the last year delivered a frustrating 8.2% decrease to the company's top line. The last three years don't look nice either as the company has shrunk revenue by 29% in aggregate. Accordingly, shareholders would have felt downbeat about the medium-term rates of revenue growth.Shifting to the future, estimates from the analysts covering the company suggest revenue should grow by 7.4% per year over the next three years. That's shaping up to be similar to the 7.5% per year growth forecast for the broader industry.With this information, we find it interesting that Zillow Group is trading at a high P/S compared to the industry. It seems most investors are ignoring the fairly average growth expectations and are willing to pay up for exposure to the stock. Although, additional gains will be difficult to achieve as this level of revenue growth is likely to weigh down the share price eventually.We'd say the price-to-sales ratio's power isn't primarily as a valuation instrument but rather to gauge current investor sentiment and future expectations.Given Zillow Group's future revenue forecasts are in line with the wider industry, the fact that it trades at an elevated P/S is somewhat surprising. When we see revenue growth that just matches the industry, we don't expect elevates P/S figures to remain inflated for the long-term. A positive change is needed in order to justify the current price-to-sales ratio.","April 19, 2023 at 5:55 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/confidence-lacking-zillow-group-inc-105556454.html,Simply Wall St.,0.0,0.0,0.1160966810966811,0.5507431457431456

With more than 19 million voucher-eligible households in 2021 but fewer than 2 million vouchers available across the country's metro areas, the program needs to be improved and better funded to help more low-income households.""Renters across the country are struggling as costs have skyrocketed and vouchers have failed to keep up,"" said Orphe Divounguy, senior economist at Zillow. ""Better calculating for voucher values and more funding are good short-term solutions, but building more homes is the long-term answer.""Zillow research found there was not a single large metro area with enough vouchers to meet demand.

ZG,"5 Best Small Towns To Retire on $2,000 a Month","To find five small towns that are great for retiring on $2,000 per month, GOBankingRates used Zillow’s February 2023 data to find every small town in the U.S. that has an average 2023 monthly rent of $1,250 or less. GOBankingRates also drew from Sperling’s Best to find the cost of living index for every city on the list, as well as other key data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ 2021 Consumer Expenditure Survey, AreaVibes and the Census Bureau.Read on to find out which five small towns are the best to retire on $2,000 a month.This Ohio town has a decent livability score of 70, and 19.4% of the population are ages 65 and older. Its monthly grocery costs of $362.76 are the priciest on this list, though still a few percentage points below the national average. Retirees will also pay slightly above the national average in monthly healthcare costs, at $579.39 per month, but overall, it’s still feasible to retire here on $2,000 per month.In this Minnesota town, although the rent is higher than Steubenville, it still ranks as more affordable because expenses here are lower. A livability score of 71 and 17.4% of the population being ages 65 and older make it a good place for retiring on $2,000 per month.In Tiffin, though the rent is the highest of all five of these towns, other factors push it up to No. 3 in the ranks, particularly its 84 livability score. Healthcare is also the cheapest on this list, at $269.07 per month. Additionally, 18% of the population is ages 65 or older, a community with a growing number of people of retirement age.Newton has the largest percentage on this list of people ages 65 and up, at 20.5%. While monthly expenses such as healthcare and utilities are above the national average, its monthly rent of $650 is the lowest on this list. Add a livability score of 82 and you can see why it takes the No. 2 spot on this list.Another Ohio town takes the No. 1 spot, Ashland, with a fantastic livability score of 87. People of retirement age, 65 or older, make up 19.3% of the population, and you can see why. With decent rent and expenditures that are all under the national average, it’s a very affordable and high-quality town to retire in.More From GOBankingRatesWhy Stealth Wealth Is the Best Way To Handle Your MoneyGot a Question About Money? Ask an ExpertHow to Build a Financial Plan From ZeroTake Our Poll: How Do You File Your Taxes?Methodology: For this study, GOBankingRates found the best small town (population less than 30,000) cities to retire on a budget of $2,000 dollars or less. GOBankingRates used Zillow’s February 2023 data to find every small town in the U.S. that has an (1) average 2023 monthly rent of $1,250 dollars or less. GOBankingRates then used Sperling’s Best to find the cost of living index for every city on the list, looking at (2) grocery, (3) utilities and (4) healthcare index scores. Next, GOBankingRates used data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ 2021 Consumer Expenditure Survey to find the annual expenditure amount for both grocery (“food at home”), healthcare, and utilities costs for people aged 65 and older in order to find how much a person 65 and over would spend on necessities in each city on a monthly basis. GOBankingRates then added monthly housing, grocery, healthcare, and utilities costs together to find where a person 65 and older could survive on $2,000 or less. In order for a city to be qualified for the study, it had to have a livabilty score of 65 or higher as sourced from AreaVibes and its population had to be 16.8% (the national average) or more over the age of 65 according to the Census Bureau’s 2021 American Community Survey. For final rankings all qualified cities were ranked by (5) total monthly expenditures, (6) % of population over 65 and (7) livability with the lowest score being best. Factor (7) was weighted 1.5x. All data was collected on and up to date as of April 5, 2023.","April 17, 2023 at 6:00 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-best-small-towns-retire-110031514.html,GOBankingRates,0.375,0.35,0.1384848484848485,0.36454545454545456

ZG,Zillow's new search tool helps buyers find homes they can afford,"Volatile mortgage rates are changing what some potential home buyers can afford from week to week, requiring a smarter way to shopZillow's new app filter allows shoppers to search for homes by a range of all-in monthly mortgage costs instead of list prices.Updated mortgage rates feed into the filter, meaning search results will stay within a shopper's budget, regardless of how rates or prices move.Shoppers can use the monthly payment filter now on the Zillow app.Shoppers can start with Zillow's linked affordability calculator, entering their down payment amount, income and debts to estimate the monthly mortgage cost they can afford. Then they enter their monthly budget range into the filter to start shopping. Updated mortgage rates feed into the filter, showing homes and hiding others to keep shoppers on budget as rates and price cuts change the monthly payment math.A new survey from Zillow Home Loans finds that the most difficult financing activity among prospective home buyers is understanding all costs associated with a mortgage payment, followed by figuring out how much home they can afford, and researching mortgages and rates.""Fast-rising mortgage rates last year pushed monthly costs up with unprecedented speed, dragging affordability to its lowest point in more than 20 years,"" said Orphe Divounguy, senior macroeconomist at Zillow Home Loans.

ZG,'Tragic total loss': This classic mansion was gutted by a fire and then listed on Zillow for $1.5 million it sold within a week. 3 other signs real es...,"The Zillow photo told the story and it wasn’t good: The mansion in the swanky Nashville suburb of Franklin showed a thick blanket of soot and extensive fire damage to its roof. That’s not exactly “move-in ready,” and with mortgage rates soaring, it’s easy to imagine this listing went up in smoke.Thankfully, no one was hurt in the fire — and no one was ready for the ending. The humbled abode sold within a week. As they say in Tennessee (and pretty much everywhere), “Wha?”Location no doubt played a role. Doesn’t it always? Immensely popular among rich music biz types (including stars), Franklin has the requisite cute boutiques and funky eateries, along with abundant green space and even Civil War battlefield history.“After nearly a year, the housing sector’s contraction is coming to an end,” said NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun. “Existing-home sales, pending contracts and new-home construction pending contracts have turned the corner and climbed for the past three months.”In the housing market, interest rates are king. And queen. And prince and princess. From a financial standpoint, mortgage rates rank as the top variable that impacts a home buyer’s decision.But that could make for a long wait. Many economists are predicting at least one more Fed rate hike in its bid to tame inflation this year — and there’s little doubt that Fed chair Jerome Powell is frustrated that he can’t cool the job or housing markets. (Too bad, Jerome: Every job seeking, house hunting/selling American feels the exact opposite way.)Still, go figure — literally. The average rate on a 30-year fixed rate mortgage has recently dropped slightly to 6.28%, according to Freddie Mac data. True, that’s nearly double where it stood in January 2022, but experts are still cautiously optimistic buyer interest will pick up as the spring season rolls on and rates trend downwards.House shopping involves more than checking in on Zillow, even if they’ve cornered the market on fire-gutted mansions in the South.As the ashes of a scorching-hot real estate market start to settle, house hunters are eagerly looking to snatch a deal. With mortgage rates and home prices on the decline, purchase applications increased for the fourth week in a row, according to Redfin’s Homebuyer Demand Index.And the number of buyers requesting to tour homes, make an offer on one or to start a home search with a Redfin agent jumped to its highest level since May 2022.Redfin’s research suggests buyers may have adapted to mortgage rates in the 6% range after 7%-plus rates scared them off in October 2022.Meanwhile, sellers who in 2021 could take advantage of low inventory and comparatively lower rates — the stuff of universal bidding wars — now face buyers who will choose wisely based on the moderating but still elevated rates. As Redfin and others have reported, sellers have been more willing to make concessions.Foreclosure starts reflect another facet of the market’s strength.Data compiled by ATTOM shows more than 90% of borrowers in foreclosure have positive equity, “which they appear to be leveraging in order to avoid a foreclosure by refinancing their mortgage or selling the property at a profit,” the group said. “It seems likely that this is a trend that will continue in 2023.”So if you’re looking to make a move — buying, selling or maneuvering past foreclosure risk — remember this stock market corollary: market timing. Getting in and out of a stock at an ideal time appears easy to do, but it’s virtually impossible. No one could have foreseen, even a year ago, how much mortgage rates would jump. Will they take off again tomorrow? We know the Fed is eyeing more rate hikes.The bottom line is that when an opportunity pops up, especially if it means a superior school district and/or a better quality of life, you may want to jump on it. No need to pursue a mansion scarred by fire — just take stock of your finances and your burning desire.This article provides information only and should not be construed as advice.

ZG,2 PropTech Stocks Poised for a Turnaround,"Property Technology, or PropTech, is an industry that centers around the digital transformation of the legacy property industry. This includes the use of software and technology tools to automate various processes and improve the customer (buyer/renter) or landlord (owner) experience. According to GrandView Research, the global PropTech market was valued at $25 billion in 2021 and is forecast to grow at a solid 15.4% compounded annual growth rate, reaching a value of $64 billion by 2028. Thus, let's take a look at two of my favorite PropTech stocks that are poised to benefit from the eventual rebound of the property market.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with Z. Click here to check it out. Z 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of ZPeter Lynch Chart of Z1. ZillowZillow (NASDAQ:Z)(NASDAQ:ZG) is the market-leading online real estate platform in the U.S. with over a 65% market share, according to data by Comscore. Despite this dominance, the company has faced major challenges since its iBuying business had a major catastrophe. Its AI models failed to forecast the dip in house prices, and many of its homes purchased for home flipping were underwater (meaning they had to be sold at a loss). This led to Zillow shuttering the segment in November 2021.A positive is Zillow has a great founder and CEO Rich Barton, who was honest and upfront about the calamity. In an earnings call, he admitted we swung for the fences and missed."" Zillow is now at a transition stage as the company aims to still create a housing super app and double its share of customer property transactions from 3% to 6% by 2025 - just without the home flipping.To accomplish this, Zillow aims to focus on its four main pillars; Touring, Financing, Seller Solutions and Enhanced Partner Network.On the Touring side, Zillow acquired ShowingTime in 2021, which enables prospective renters to schedule viewings directly inside the application. This reduces the friction of the entire process and mitigates the need for phone calls, which are not really popular with the Gen Z customers. Progress has been solid so far, with roll outs in Atlanta, Houston, Dallas and Denver in 2022.Zillow has also not completely given up on iBuying as it signed a deal with ex-competitor Opendoor (NASDAQ:OPEN), which enables Opendoor sellers to get an offer directly via Zillow. I believe this is a positive strategic move that will allow the two companies to benefit from each other.Challenging financials Zillow has made positive progress after its iBuying failure, but the company is facing major challenges driven by the rising interest rate environment and a cyclical decline in the housing market. The company reported revenue of $435 million in its recent quarter, which declined by an eye-watering 19% year over year.The major pain was felt in Zillows Mortgages segment, which reported a 65% year-over-year decline to just $18 million as prospective buyers halt purchases.The silver lining for Zillow is the Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes look to be working and inflation has been on a downward trend from its high in June 2022.Another positive is if people arent buying as many homes in the short term, they are likely renting. This dynamic showed up in the numbers with a 13% increase in rental revenue in the fourth quarter of 2022.Moving on to profitability, Zillow reported a net loss of $72 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. This may seem bad, but it was actually an improvement over the loss of $261 million reported in the equivalent quarter of the prior year.Zillow also has a solid balance sheet with $3.4 billion in cash and marketable securities versus total debt of $1.8 billion, the majority (~$1.7 billion) of which is long-term debt.Valuation2. OpendoorOpendoor (NASDAQ:OPEN) is the U.S. leader in the iBuying of real estate, which is a technology-enhanced version of home flipping. As previously mentioned, Opendoors new partnership with Zillow provides many synergies and cements the company as the dominant leader in the U.S. iBuying market.Opendoor is rapidly moving towards creating a sell it now style e-commerce solution that will enable homes to be sold to the company rapidly.The first step involves getting a preliminary offer so the seller has an approximate idea of the price Opendoor is willing to pay for the property. Next, the Opendoor platform assists with recording a video walkthrough before an offer is finalized and the closing date set up. I believe this has the potential to become an extremely powerful solution as it can effectively increase the liquidity in the real estate market, which could increase the velocity of transactions and thus enable more opportunities to capture economic value.Opendoor also plans to introduce a third-party marketplace as well, although it has been slow to ramp up this, much to the dismay of analysts.Struggling financialsOpendoor reported mixed financial results for the fourth quarter of 2022. Its revenue was $2.857 billion, which declined by an eye-watering 25.25% year over year. This was driven by reduced sales due to the rising interest rate environment, which has impacted the mortgage market. To combat this, Opendoor has started to reduce its pace of new property acquisitions due to market uncertainty.Its number of homes acquired declined by a substantial 64% in the fourth quarter to just 3,427. A positive is the company reported rapid revenue growth of 94% year over year for the full year of 2022, with $15.6 billion generated.Moving on to margins, its overall contribution margin was -7.2%. Operating losses grew from $102 million to $192 million, which was not a great sign. A positive is the adjusted Ebitda loss was $351 million, which was in line with management's guidance.Opendoor has a strong balance sheet with ~$1.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments and ~$670 million of equity invested in its homes compared to $5.4 billion in debt. The business also executed $12 billion in asset-backed facilities is in excess of current inventory levels. This is a positive sign given the uncertain real estate market.ValuationFinal thoughts Both Zillow and Opendoor are two tremendous PropTech companies that are both facing challenging times due to the macroeconomic environment. I believe interest rates will begin to be lowered soon as inflation continues to fall, which should make mortgage rates more affordable. This should help to boost the real estate market by brining homebuyers and investors back in. As an investment prospect, I like Zillow better as its business model is less risky after the iBuying exit.","April 7, 2023 at 12:05 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-proptech-stocks-poised-turnaround-170528855.html,GuruFocus.com,0.0,0.0,0.10841532976827097,0.4217718360071302

ZG,"She sheds, steam ovens can help sell homes for up to $17,400 more","Zillow finds that doorbell cameras and soapstone countertops can help sell a home up to 5 days fasterSteam ovens, which use steam instead of hot air or oil to cook food, contributed to the top sale premium of 5.3%.Personalized and playful features, such as pizza ovens and putting greens, were associated with a sale price premium of as much as 3.7%.Features such as tile countertops and laminate were more common in homes selling for less than expected.Homes that sell faster than expected — signaling more competing buyers — boast more practical features, such as doorbell cameras, heat pumps and fenced backyards. A doorbell camera and open shelving are relatively affordable upgrades that can improve a home's functionality and boost sale speed by five days and three days, respectively.Zillow looked at 271 features and design terms mentioned in listing descriptions across nearly 2 million home sales in 2022. While there are many factors that contribute to a home selling faster or for more than expected, these features reflect what today's buyers are looking for in a home.Homes get personalThat said, sellers who have invested in personalized features may have to wait a bit longer to find the right buyer. For instance, homes with she sheds can sell for 2.5% more than expected, but spend an extra two days on the market. Similarly, listings that mention wine cellars can command a 1.2% sale premium but take five days longer to sell than similar homes.Buyers just want to have funBuyers who can not only afford today's higher mortgage rates but also pay above and beyond typical market value appear willing to splurge on fun features designed to impress. Multifunctional homes that offer retreat spaces and features for outdoor entertaining are particularly appealing to post-pandemic buyers, who expect their homes to be a place where they can work and play.Unique materials outshine old favoritesOnly quartz came close to rivaling these newly popular surfaces, with listings that mention quartz countertops commanding a 2.4% sale premium and selling one day faster than expected. Quartz had been the top-performing surface for two consecutive years.Takeaways for spring sellersHomeowners looking to sell for top dollar this spring will want to highlight these home features if they've got them. But installing a steam oven — or any one of these features — solely for resale may not deliver the ROI they're looking for. These keywords should be viewed instead as signals of perceived quality. These are the features today's buyers associate with a ""nice house,"" along with many other factors that go into that perception. For instance, if a home has a steam oven, the buyer assumes it likely has a lot of other bells and whistles that go into a high-end chef's kitchen.Takeaways for spring buyersTop 10 features that sell for more than expectedFeaturePrice premiumSteam oven5.3 %Pizza oven3.7 %Professional appliances3.6 %Terrazzo2.6 %She shed2.5 %Soapstone2.5 %Quartz2.4 %Modern farmhouse2.4 %Hurricane shutters/storm shutters2.3 %Mid-century2.3 %Top 10 features that sell faster than expectedFeatureDays fasterDoorbell camera5.1Soapstone3.8Open shelving3.5Heat pump3.0Fenced (back)yard2.9Mid-century2.8Hardwood2.4Walkability/walkable2.4Shiplap2.3Gas furnace2.3(ZFIN)SOURCE Zillow Group, Inc.","April 4, 2023 at 7:00 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/she-sheds-steam-ovens-help-120000554.html,PR Newswire,0.5,0.5,0.18219954648526077,0.4798185941043084

Short interest dipped 3.8% in the last reporting period, but the 18.47 million shares sold short still make up 12.2% the equity's available float, or over one week's worth of pent-up buying power.","March 30, 2023 at 1:13 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zillow-group-stocks-technical-ceiling-191331959.html,Schaeffer&#39;s Investment Research,0.0,0.08333333333333334,0.06388888888888888,0.25740740740740736
ZG,2 Stocks Down 79% and 91% That Could Soar in the Second Half of 2023,"Real estate has been one of the hardest-hit sectors over the past 18 months, since the U.S. Federal Reserve embarked on its most aggressive campaign to raise interest rates in its history. First, inflation appears to be cooling, which might prompt the Fed to rethink future interest rate increases. Plus, on the back of the recent crisis in the U.S. regional banking sector, some economists are now calling for the Fed to start cutting rates in 2023.","March 29, 2023 at 3:25 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/m/6a6e5887-1a12-3e0c-93ea-448eda0045ef/2-stocks-down-79%25-and-91%25.html,Motley Fool,-0.10740740740740741,0.15185185185185188,0.012499999999999997,0.33229166666666665
ZG,Time to Buy KB Home (KBH) or Zillow Group (ZG) Stock?,"With KB Home and Zillow stock off to strong starts this year, let’s see if it’s time for investors to buy into their rallies.Performance Overview Mortgage rates continuted to climb to their highest levels in 20 years after skyrocketing over 7% in October and affecting many companies in the broader housing industry.This certainly had an ill effect on KB Homes' stock last year as one of the largest and most recognizable homebuilders in the United States. Similarly, shares of Zillow Group were submerged in volatility with the company being the largest online real estate and home-related provider in the country.However, KB Home and Zillow stocks were more resilient than one might have imagined and are having strong performances so far this year. Year to date, Zillow stock has soared +34% Vs. KB Home’s +26% with both outperforming the S&P 500’s +4%.Even better, KB Home stock is still up +121% over the last three years to easily top the benchmark and Zillow’s +20%.  ValuationWith such impressive year-to-date performances, monitoring Zillow and KB Homes’ valuation will be important. Both stocks currently trade around $40 a share.However, Zillow stock is still 24% from its 52-week high and trades at 37.4X forward earnings. In comparison, KB Home stock recently hits its 52-week highs and is still trading at just 8.8X forward earnings. KB Home also trades 92% below its decade high of 115X and at a slight discount to the median of 10.9X.Even better, KB Homes’ price-to-earnings valuation is nicely below the S&P 500’s 18.3X and on par with the Building Products-Home Builders industry average. While Zillow stock is above the benchmark’s P/E valuation and the Internet-Services industry average of 27.7X it does trade much more reasonable than its extreme decade highs and the median of 437.4X.Growth & Outlook Monitoring the growth of both companies will help clarify if investors should be paying a premium for Zillow stock and if KB Homes' low P/E valuation is a bargain.Looking at Zillow, earnings are expected to dip - 21% in fiscal 2023 but rebound and climb 55% in FY24 at $1.74 per share. However, earnings estimate revisions have trended down for both FY23 and FY24 throughout the quarter.  Sales are forecasted to drop -71% this year to $1.85 billion compared to $6.18 billion in 2022. Fiscal 2024 earnings are expected to stabilize and rise 13% to $2.09 billion.Pivoting to KB Home, earnings are projected to drop -50% this year at $4.52 per share after stellar growth in 2022 with EPS at $9.12 primarily attributed to the company’s backlog despite inflationary concerns affecting future business.Still, fiscal 2024 earnings are forecasted to rebound 15% at $5.21 per share. Even better, earnings estimates have started to go up again after the company blasted its first-quarter bottom line expectations last week. On the top line, sales are now forecasted to be down -22% this year and then rise 3% in FY24 to $5.57 billion.Bottom Line  At the moment, KB Home (KBH) stock sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) with Zillow Group (ZG) landing a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Both companies remain viable investments for exposure to the broader housing industry and should have solid growth as inflationary concerns begin to ease.With that being said, KB Homes may already be on this trajectory and investors should consider buying KBH stock as the company’s P/E valuation is attractive along with the rising earnings estimates. Zillow stock could have more upside from its current levels as well, and holding on to ZG shares may be rewarding but there might be better buying opportunities ahead.KB Home (KBH) : Free Stock Analysis ReportZillow Group, Inc.

ZG,The US homeownership gender gap is getting wider again,"Read moreChatGPT is getting more nuancedChina is changing its tune on the mRNA vaccineA fresh idea for gathering remote and hybrid employees togetherMeanwhile, the homeownership rate for single men increased by 2.7% in 2022 to 33.1%.datawrapper-chart-LV4PIFor single women looking to live in one of the largest metro areas in the US, their best bet is in Pittsburgh, St. Louis, or Detroit. These cities have the highest share of affordable listings for single women—but even that’s only around 30%.Zillow found that single women might be able to compete better with single men in Atlanta, Baltimore, Maryland; Washington DC; and Raleigh, North Carolina. In those places, the average single woman would only find 2% of listings affordable, but at least that’s 90% of the listings single men can afford.Cincinnati, Kansas City, Oklahoma City, Minneapolis, New Orleans, and Jacksonville, Florida, have the largest gender gap in homeownership. Single women in these cities are able to afford fewer than 70% of the homes single men can afford.Not surprisingly, homes in California are the least affordable all around, with single women being able to afford 0.1% to 0.3% of active listings. In Sacramento, housing is outright unaffordable for the average single woman, who would be unable to afford any of the homes for sale that the average single man could afford.“With rising and volatile mortgage rates furthering affordability challenges, the road to affordable homeownership remains an uphill battle, and it may take creative solutions or even doubling up in a home to achieve that dream,” Zillow’s Olsen said.More from QuartzThe split of the African plate could gift six landlocked countries a coastlineHow Credit Suisse’s demise strengthens Switzerland’s place in global financeClick here to read the full article.","March 24, 2023 at 8:53 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-homeownership-gender-gap-getting-145300714.html,Quartz,0.0,0.0,0.08284030784030783,0.4041937229437229

ZG,These 133 housing markets saw home prices decline in Februarybut 267 markets ticked higher,"Fast-forward to 2023, and that correction has clearly lost geographical momentum. In January, 171 of the nation's 400 largest housing markets registered a month-over-month home price decline. And in February, just 133 of the nation's 400 largest housing markets registered a month-over-month home price decline, while 267 housing markets saw a month-over-month increase in home prices.View this interactive chart on Fortune.comHowever, that momentum has already stalled: Through the first two months of 2023, many small and mid-sized markets in the Midwest, South, and Northeast have shifted from correction-mode to growth-mode. Meanwhile, many Western markets, like Boise and San Francisco, continue to post home price declines.Regardless of whether the housing bulls or housing bears are right, the results are going to vary significantly by market.Back in the early 2000s, housing speculators assumed the best bang for their buck would be in fast-growing Sunbelt cities. As it turned out, that flood of investment meant places like Las Vegas and Phoenix got crushed even harder when the housing bubble ultimately burst and spurred the 2008 financial crisis.Fast-forward to this housing cycle, and Phoenix is once again at the center of the story.If one describes Phoenix's home price correction as sharp, they'd have to call the correction in Indianapolis, well, faint.Through February, seasonally adjusted home prices in Indianapolis are only down 0.97% from their 2022 peak. And while Phoenix home prices slipped another 0.9% in February, Indianapolis home prices ticked up 0.1% last month.5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeExpert advice to keep your money safe during bank failuresUFB Direct savings account is offering an APY above 5%—and with no feesThis is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 home ","March 21, 2023 at 2:50 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/133-housing-markets-saw-home-085031335.html,Fortune,0.25,0.5,0.14500661375661375,0.3930390211640211
ZG,"Buyers are in the game, but interest rates are keeping sellers on the bench","Relatively high rates are keeping new listings low, frustrating willing buyersNew listings are at a record low for February, contributing to an incredibly low supply.Sales activity lost momentum in February as rates rose.U.S. home values stabilized after a six-month decline.Well-priced homes are moving. At 17 days, the median time to pending is faster than before the pandemic.Mortgage rates have been incredibly volatile over the past six months, and buyers are responding to the chance to lock in a cheaper monthly payment when the opportunity arises. Sales activity is picking up, just not accelerating like it usually does at this time of year. After being reinvigorated by lower rates in late January, sales slowed over the course of February as rates hiked back up. All in all, February saw 19% fewer newly pending sales than last year and 5% fewer sales than the most recent pre-pandemic reading in 2020.Ultralow inventory means that when attractive, well-priced houses do come on the market, they are readily finding buyers. Homes that went under contract in February did so after a median span of 17 days. That's more time than in 2022 and 2021, when time on market was seven and nine days, respectively, but significantly less than before the pandemic.Rates are likely to remain volatile through the spring selling season.

ZG,Zillow (ZG) Down 13.2% Since Last Earnings Report: Can It Rebound?,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Zillow Group (ZG). Shares have lost about 13.2% in that time frame, underperforming the S&P 500.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Zillow due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.During the quarter, Zillow recorded a gross profit of $346 million compared with $440 million in the prior-year quarter. The decline is primarily due to lower revenues. The operating expenses during the quarter were $429 million, up from $408 million in the prior-year quarter.  Adjusted EBITDA was $73 million compared with $154 million in the prior-year quarter, primarily driven by a significant fall in adjusted EBITDA in the IMT segment.For the full year 2022, Zillow generated $4,504 million cash from operating activities against $3,177 million cash utilization in the prior-year period. As of Dec 31, 2022, the company had $1,466 million in cash and cash equivalents with $139 million of lease liabilities, net of the current portion compared with respective tallies of $2,315 million and $148 million in the prior-year period.For the first quarter of 2023, Zillow estimates total revenue to be in the range of $404-$437 million, indicating a 22% year-over-year decline. Total adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $48 million to $63 million. Within the IMT segment, the company anticipates Premier Agent revenue to decline in the range of 23% to 28% year over year. Management expects a modest increase in operating expenditures and cost of revenues owing to investments in VRX media and the company’s new ShowingTime+ products.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?Analysts were quiet during the last two month period as none of them issued any earnings estimate revisions.VGM ScoresCurrently, Zillow has a great Growth Score of A, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with an F. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of D on the value side, putting it in the bottom 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.OutlookZillow has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We expect a below average return from the stock in the next few months.Performance of an Industry PlayerZillow is part of the Zacks Internet - Services industry.

ZG,"Home Prices Will Bottom Out in 2023, According to Experts","Nationally, prices are predicted to drop by 1.6% through the end of the year, with the largest declines in expensive metro areas. Growth over the next four years is expected to average 3.5%, comparable to the long-term average. New home sales could decline to 2016 levels this year.“The housing market is resetting. Though we’re seeing early signs of renewed buyer interest early this year, prices should generally flatten out in 2023, helping buyers to catch up,” said Zillow senior economist Jeff Tucker.“The sheer number of people in the first-time homebuyer age range and a lack of inventory should limit price declines. A return to more normal growth would be welcome after the rollercoaster ride that home prices have been on lately,” Tucker added.Affordability constraints have limited the demand for housing. According to Freddie Mac, lower mortgage rates in January brought some buyers back into the market, but now rates (for a 30-year fixed mortgage) are closing in at 7%. This has made it difficult for potential buyers to take action, particularly for repeat buyers with existing mortgages with rates less than half of current rates.Zillow’s expert panel said mortgage rates could trend downward after the first quarter. However, experts pointed out that falling rates are significantly more helpful in terms of affordability as compared to lowering home prices.Sales of existing homes are predicted to fall to 2.3 million this year from 5 million in 2022, Zillow reported. New construction may also pick up to meet the need for inventory — and home builders have given buyers financial incentives to help overcome affordability challenges.More From GOBankingRates10 US Real Estate Markets To Avoid for NowFinancial Insight in Your Inbox: Sign Up for GBR's Daily NewsletterMaximize your savings with these 3 expert tipsHow To Save Money When Filing Taxes","March 3, 2023 at 11:01 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/home-prices-bottom-2023-according-170112158.html,GOBankingRates,0.0,0.0,0.03948773448773449,0.3950649350649351
ZG,Expert panel expects home prices will grow at a steady pace starting in 2024,"Economists surveyed by Zillow predict home-price slide will end this yearThe panel forecasts prices to slide 1.6% in 2023; growth over the following four years is expected to average 3.5%, equivalent to the long-term average.New home sales are expected to decline to near 2016 levels this year.Sales of both new and existing single-family homes are expected to slide in 2023.Starting next year, however, the panel foresees price growth picking back up, at an average clip of 3.5% per year through 2027 – the same rate that prices grew in the relatively stable period from 1987-1999, before the housing boom and bust cycle in the 2000s.Sales of existing homes are forecast to fall to 4.2 million in 2023 – up slightly from November and December's seasonally adjusted annual rate of sales, but lower than 5.0 million sales in the course of calendar year 2022.The panel also expects mortgage rates to trend downward after the first quarter. Asked when rates for 30-year fixed loans will be highest between now and 2025, nearly two thirds (63%) pointed to Q1 of 2023. A distant second was the second quarter of 2023 at 22%, and subsequent quarters earned 6% or less.

ZG,Hard lessons from 2019's Zillow fiasco: How homebuyers and sellers can avoid the same mistake when pricing a property in 2023,"If you’ve ever wondered what you could get for your home, you probably pulled up the real estate listing site Zillow to check its Zestimate.The algorithm-fueled pricing tool estimates values for millions of homes across the country and is a popular resource for homebuyers and sellers alike.However, determining a home’s value is a delicate process — not something easily accomplished at the push of a button.Problems with the company's estimates forced it to shut down its home-buying business and lay off a quarter of its staff. Zillow (NASDAQ: ZG) stock plunged 80% from its peak value.In 2019, Seattle-based Zillow launched its iBuyer business, called Zillow Offers, to purchase homes directly from owners, make repairs and put them back on the market.Zillow was so confident in its pricing algorithm that it said its Zestimates would serve as the initial offer price on eligible homes. That didn’t last.The company announced in 2021 that it was exiting the iBuying business. In a quarterly earnings call, CEO Rich Barton said Zillow was unable to correctly forecast future home prices amid volatility in the pandemic-driven housing frenzy.“Zillow Offers appears to have made both mistakes and done so at a large enough scale to result in hundreds of millions of dollars of losses,” Sharga wrote.One lesson stands out from the Zillow fiasco: Property values can change fast. Do your homework on fair market value.Your real estate agent must know your neighborhood. Good realtors analyze recent similar property sales to recommend a list price, says Corey Burr of TTR Sotheby's International Realty in Washington, D.C.“I don’t know any seasoned agents who depend on the Zestimate for a pricing recommendation,” Burr tells Moneywise.“But because the marketplace is so familiar with Zestimates, it often would be discussed relative to what buyers’ expectations of a property might be.”While not legally required, your real estate agent will likely suggest you get an appraisal and include an appraisal contingency in your offer.An appraiser examines the home and studies market trends, along with other factors such as location and whether the house is in a flood zone.It’s tempting to accept the prices spit out by private real estate websites — Zillow is one of many — but remember that those figures are simply estimates. Zillow even says buyers and sellers should supplement Zestimates with their own research.With your realtor or on your own, compare a home with similar properties. Be sure to consider less obvious factors such as school zones. Two similar houses in the same area can have wildly different values if only one is zoned to a top-rated public school.Of course, buying a home isn't the only way to invest in real estate.Amid persistent inflation and an uncertain economy, real estate moguls are still finding ways to effectively invest their millions.This article provides information only and should not be construed as advice.

ZG,Homes owned by Black families appreciated the fastest during the pandemic,"Black Americans' housing wealth has made strides, but remains well below that of the typical U.S. householdThe gap between the value of the typical Black-owned home and the typical U.S. home is the smallest it's been in the past two decades.The typical Black-owned home is worth 14.8% less than the typical home overall.Among Black homeowners, Black women saw the largest recent increase in homeownership rates.HomeownershipIn 2021, the latest available data from the U.S. Census Bureau, 44% of Black households owned their homes, compared with 73.3% of white households — a gap of more than 29 points.According to the most recent U.S Census Bureau data, Black homeownership increased 2 percentage points from 2019 to 2021, compared to 1.3% for the nation at large. Black women ages 45–54 and 75 and older saw the largest increase among Black homeowners during the pandemic, with 2.9 percentage points of growth. Black men ages 35–44 saw a 2.5 percentage-point jump in homeownership rate over that period, the second-largest increase in the group.Still, for many Black Americans, barriers to accessing homeownership abound. Many markets with the highest appreciation in Black home values also have the highest mortgage denial rates for Black applicants, meaning the markets where Black homeowners have the best chance of improving their household wealth and gaining equity with homeowners overall are markets where it's most difficult for Black mortgage applicants to actually become homeowners.Pandemic-era Changes in Black Americans' Housing WealthMetropolitan area*TypicalBlack-ownedhome valueBlack home-ownershipBlack home- ownershiprate gap,relative towhitehouseholds,as of 2021(percentage points)United States-2.5$280,925$329,5422.0 %-29.3Detroit, MI-9$138,574$228,2493.0 %-34Kansas City, MO-8$215,141$276,8893.3 %-30.8Chicago, IL-6.9$197,274$289,4692.5 %-33.4Cleveland, OH-5.8$131,011$203,3570.6 %-38.3Milwaukee, WI-5.7$193,825$291,8412.4 %-41.5Birmingham, AL-5.6$142,312$236,6306.8 %-25.4Buffalo, NY-5.4$143,705$234,0920.7 %-37.5Louisville–Jefferson County, KY-5.2$175,981$238,5202.8 %-36.3Oklahoma City, OK-4.6$178,587$213,3421.3 %-33Jacksonville, FL-4.3$286,527$348,6675.7 %-24.1Philadelphia, PA-4.2$251,014$323,9741.5 %-26.2Pittsburgh, PA-4.2$148,175$194,4896.2 %-38St. Louis, MO-4.1$144,377$225,7934.1 %-35.8Columbus, OH-4.1$229,721$285,6482.0 %-37.6Richmond, VA-4$310,539$334,1580.5 %-26.4Baltimore, MD-3.5$306,991$352,9310.4 %-32.4Memphis, TN-3.3$175,121$226,8461.8 %-33Indianapolis, IN-3.2$236,035$257,6201.0 %-36.3New York, NY-2.7$515,993$574,0742.1 %-32.9Atlanta, GA-2.7$312,955$357,3124.6 %-25.3Hartford, CT-2$251,188$309,788-0.1 %-33.8Tampa, FL-1.9$323,866$360,5781.4 %-28.6Cincinnati, OH-1.9$207,773$252,1292.3 %-39.6Houston, TX-1.5$252,508$295,1082.2 %-31.8Sacramento, CA-1.3$506,275$538,0420.2 %-34.9Charlotte, NC-1.1$305,422$354,9771.5 %-30.4Orlando, FL-1.1$334,894$372,553-0.5 %-26.3Raleigh, NC-1.1$358,981$414,8103.9 %-28.9Dallas–Fort Worth, TX-1$301,292$359,7431.2 %-31.7Providence, RI-1$385,681$424,480-2.1 %-35.3Boston, MA-0.8$506,924$607,1151.4 %-33.4San Antonio, TX-0.8$285,415$287,2063.8 %-23.8Virginia Beach, VA-0.8$299,921$316,1561.1 %-31.1Miami–Fort Lauderdale, FL-0.7$367,818$442,0443.0 %-24.2New Orleans, LA-0.6$202,036$240,7170.5 %-27Washington, DC-0.5$489,038$521,3470.9 %-21.2Phoenix, AZ-0.5$387,527$429,7755.4 %-33.7Austin, TX-0.1$390,391$476,5810.9 %-24San Jose, CA0$1,220,780$1,358,777-1.8 %-38.5Salt Lake City, UT0$513,061$523,7312.2 %-47.3Denver, CO+0.1$504,356$568,272-4.1 %-29.8Las Vegas, NV+0.1$383,782$391,3933.7 %-33Nashville, TN+0.1$368,530$420,9483.2 %-29.2Portland, OR+0.5$501,708$523,2721.4 %-25.8Los Angeles–Long Beach–Anaheim, CA+0.6$681,532$841,462-2.5 %-25.1Minneapolis–St. Paul, MN-0.8$303,390$349,4726.6 %-45Riverside, CA+1.5$529,626$531,4162.1 %-26.3Seattle, WA+1.5$573,551$688,3124.0 %-33San Diego, CA+1.7$652,147$816,218-0.3 %-34San Francisco, CA+3.6$826,439$1,087,239-0.9 %-28.8 *Ranked by largest reduction in home value gap between Black-owned homes and the overall typical home in the regionAbout Zillow Group SOURCE Zillow","February 27, 2023 at 6:45 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/homes-owned-black-families-appreciated-124500535.html,PR Newswire,0.016666666666666677,0.26666666666666666,0.027584204413472705,0.39134727061556335

ZG,"Etsy is very proactive in monitoring, removing counterfeit items: Analyst","JMP Securities (a Citizens Company) Equity Research Analyst Nick Jones joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss e-commerce trends behind eBay, how Etsy is cracking down on counterfeiters, the outlook for Carvana shares, and Zillow's status within the real estate environment.[AUDIO LOGO]It's great to have you here. So let's start with eBay because I think some of the results here from Walmart, from Home Depot this morning raising some questions about what we could potentially see from other consumer-facing names. What are you expecting to hear from eBay?So what'll be interesting, particularly for eBay, is if they're, kind of, focused categories, where they're trying to get consumers to spend a little bit more money, versus, kind of, transactional users. They're not spending as much. If they can, kind of, keep those users coming back and spending more, I think that's really going to be in focus and maybe where the data breaks down a little bit.But so far, eBay looks like it's going to have a solid 4Q, and 1Q so far looks like it'll probably be in line with expectations. But we'll see tomorrow.So another one where we think the trends look pretty resilient-- Etsy's really been one of the strongest performers in e-commerce. Their upper funnel trends have been really resilient, still growing year-over-year where many companies are declining, like Home Depot or Walmart. So we think Etsy's in a similar situation where 4Q's going to look decent and 1Q commentary is probably going to be pretty strong as well.And Etsy has-- they're very proactive. They have a lot of automated algorithms to try to find counterfeit items and remove them. They even put out a report every year. So, you know, we don't see that as a huge threat to Etsy at all.I think there still are concerns around where spending is going to go. Saving rates are down, so far, so where will PCE trend, kind of, throughout the year, particularly as the Fed reacts to better jobs and the PMI numbers today? We'll see. Of the two, we think Etsy is the one to own. They have a robust platform, touching a lot of end markets, really strong brand recognition.We really think, kind of, the tactical picks will come into play here, and we think Etsy's the one to own in e-commerce.Just you and one other analyst has the equivalent of an outperform rating on Carvana. What do you see that most other people are missing right now?We don't think they're going to run out of cash anytime soon, and that will likely get to a more favorable market, where they could go raise capital or refinance debt and, kind of, navigate near-term headwinds. So, kind of, the-- they, kind of-- first factor here is, will they or won't they go bankrupt? And we don't think they're going to go bankrupt. So if you don't think they're going to go bankrupt, it's a very strong consumer offering that will continue to gain share over time.It's just, kind of, got to get through near-term narrative challenges, if you will, as far as their balance sheet strength. So we think people are being overly punitive on their bankruptcy risk. We don't see them going bankrupt. We don't see them running out of cash.We think they have plenty of options to, kind of, navigate near-term headwinds. So, because of that, when you see the stock down at these levels, we think it's a very, very compelling price point to enter the stock.So as rates keep going up, that's going to continue to pressure the ecosystem and transaction volume. So all said on Zillow, really strong company. But there's a lot of headwinds, and they're a very mature company, so we see them potentially having some pressures as we get through the year and really got to keep an eye on what's going to happen to mortgage rates and while there are not, kind of, these millennials and other groups of people that haven't really bought their first home yet come in and are willing to pay these interest rates and the prices that are still out there.Because if you look at the data, the prices really haven't pulled back yet. They've pulled back somewhat, but not as much as you would expect given the rates.","February 21, 2023 at 3:47 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/etsy-very-proactive-monitoring-removing-214713003.html,Yahoo Finance Video,0.2,0.3,0.22877585377585372,0.5560613756613757

ZG,Home prices stabilize as buyers get a jump on spring shopping,"Mortgage rates and homeowners' decision to list will determine whether momentum continuesU.S. home values are up 6% from a year ago and are 39% higher than in 2020.Buyers took advantage of slightly lower mortgage rates in January — sales are close to 2020 levels.Sellers are hanging back, with inventory at the second-lowest January level on record.Buyers returning, but potential sellers opt outThe number of people buying homes has ticked up since the fall and is looking like a normal, pre-pandemic January. At a low point in November, newly pending listings were down 38% compared to one year earlier. In January, they were only down 20% from the previous year and were right in line with 2020.This means competition for well-priced houses is stronger than before the pandemic, but don't expect the widespread bidding wars of 2021 and early 2022.It took a median of 31 days for a home to sell in January, indicating that buyer competition for attractive listings is livelier than pre-pandemic norms (more than 40 days to pending), but not as furious as in 2022 (nine days to pending) or 2021 (17 days to pending).Will sellers return? If they do, what mortgage rates will buyers be facing?In the first two weeks of February, mortgage rates shot up by as much as 0.75 of a percentage point, proving that no one can count on a consistent downward trajectory for rates this year. Continued rate hikes would stunt supply as well as demand. Homeowners with very low mortgage rates will be reluctant to sell and have to buy another home with a much higher rate. Meanwhile, buyers are already straining their budgets to get into a mortgage. Sellers waiting for peak demand to try to get the best price for their listing may find few buyers able to afford it.United States$329,5426.2 %-0.1 %$1,59545.8 %-35.7 %22New York, NY$574,0744.1 %0.7 %$2,77040.6 %-42.9 %7$841,4620.1 %-0.7 %$4,15139.4 %-27.8 %23Chicago, IL$289,4693.7 %0.6 %$1,39140.2 %-45.8 %13$359,7434.5 %-0.7 %$1,75245.8 %-35.0 %19Philadelphia, PA$323,9747.0 %0.4 %$1,56145.4 %-35.6 %6Houston, TX$295,1085.3 %-0.7 %$1,43645.9 %-25.3 %29Washington, DC$521,3471.8 %0.0 %$2,52938.6 %-28.8 %10Miami–Fort Lauderdale, FL$442,04412.8 %-0.2 %$2,14155.6 %-37.4 %22Atlanta, GA$357,3126.1 %-0.4 %$1,73547.5 %-32.8 %29Boston, MA$607,1153.4 %-0.3 %$2,94141.5 %-30.7 %7$1,087,239-4.9 %-0.4 %$5,31832.1 %0.0 %23Detroit, MI$228,2495.4 %0.4 %$1,09743.0 %-29.4 %18Riverside, CA$531,4162.5 %-0.9 %$2,60742.6 %-28.7 %39Phoenix, AZ$429,7750.3 %-0.6 %$2,10539.0 %2.8 %49Seattle, WA$688,312-0.8 %-0.2 %$3,34638.0 %4.7 %32$349,4721.6 %-0.5 %$1,69138.5 %-38.9 %31San Diego, CA$816,2181.1 %-0.6 %$3,98941.1 %-37.7 %25St. Louis, MO$225,7936.5 %0.4 %$1,08644.8 %-48.2 %4Tampa, FL$360,5788.2 %-0.5 %$1,75150.7 %-17.0 %27$352,9314.0 %0.9 %$1,69440.0 %-43.9 %8Denver, CO$568,272-0.2 %-0.1 %$2,76637.6 %-18.8 %24$194,4893.7 %0.2 %$93741.0 %-32.9 %15Portland, OR$523,272-0.2 %-0.5 %$2,54437.1 %-20.1 %30Charlotte, NC$354,9776.4 %-0.5 %$1,72547.6 %-14.9 %20$538,042-2.6 %-1.2 %$2,63635.1 %-23.8 %29$287,2065.3 %-0.2 %$1,39345.1 %-11.2 %36Orlando, FL$372,5538.4 %-0.8 %$1,81451.0 %-18.5 %29$252,1296.1 %0.0 %$1,21544.7 %-36.4 %5Cleveland, OH$203,3577.8 %0.0 %$97946.5 %-45.9 %9$276,8897.1 %0.4 %$1,33345.7 %-42.7 %7Las Vegas, NV$391,3930.5 %-1.2 %$1,92240.2 %-11.9 %52$285,6487.8 %0.0 %$1,37947.9 %-34.0 %4$257,6205.4 %-0.6 %$1,24645.0 %-22.7 %San Jose, CA$1,358,777-2.3 %-1.1 %$6,72238.4 %-17.4 %20Austin, TX$476,581-1.1 %-1.0 %$2,33739.1 %29.1 %50$316,1565.3 %0.3 %$1,52542.9 %-46.2 %11Nashville, TN$420,9486.4 %-0.1 %$2,04247.8 %-18.0 %35$424,4807.0 %0.2 %$2,04846.0 %-58.6 %10$291,8416.3 %0.7 %$1,39842.7 %-3$348,6679.3 %-0.9 %$1,69752.7 %-13.5 %Memphis, TN$226,8467.4 %0.0 %$1,09647.6 %-20.2 %14$213,3428.3 %-0.9 %$1,03549.0 %-23.4 %14Louisville, KY$238,5205.2 %0.3 %$1,14942.9 %-33.9 %8Hartford, CT$309,7888.6 %0.0 %$1,49448.2 %-66.9 %2Richmond, VA$334,1588.6 %0.2 %$1,61248.2 %-46.9 %4$240,7170.6 %1.7 %$1,15434.0 %31.4 %36Buffalo, NY$234,0926.3 %-0.4 %$1,12945.0 %-45.4 %10Raleigh, NC$414,8105.0 %-0.5 %$2,01846.0 %-26.7 %$236,6307.5 %0.7 %$1,13946.4 %-23.0 %16$523,7310.0 %0.1 %$2,54037.5 %0.3 %38*Table ordered by market size SOURCE Zillow","February 21, 2023 at 7:00 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/home-prices-stabilize-buyers-jump-130000584.html,PR Newswire,0.0,0.0,0.15948472823472823,0.4312376743626744

As we quickly shed our iBuying inventory and embarked on our new journey more nimbly, the unprecedented housing macro volatility continued this time to the downside, the scenario we had feared could happen. 30-year mortgage interest rates nearly doubled over the course of the first six months of 2022, meaningfully slowing turnover and home price appreciation in the housing market. Despite these significant changes for our company and the housing market at large, our team remains focused on innovation with our eyes forward.We are working on building solutions and delivering products for our customers, our agent partners and the industry that make it easier for people to transact in real estate and ultimately transact with Zillow. We're rapidly releasing products and improving both the customer and agent experience to ensure that when customers come to Zillow, they choose to stay and explore our other offerings. We released products at a rapid pace and service to our integrated transaction strategy, including the launch of natural language search, listing media services through Showing Time Plus, our partnership with Opendoor and real-time touring among many other product releases. The result of these efforts have put the company on solid ground heading into 2023.Our traffic and brand are extremely strong with average monthly unique users of 198 million during Q4, and roughly 65% of mobile app users for the real estate marketplaces category. Additionally, 2022 was a year where Zillow regained its spot as the number one most visited rentals platform according to comScore, putting us in a great position for future growth. Despite a challenging operating environment in 2022, when we attempted to normalize for COVID volatility, we have a go-forward business that has grown consolidated revenue by 12% on an annualized basis since 2019, and while our IMT segment grew EBITDA by 30% on an annualized basis over that same time frame. Equally important, we exited 2022 with a solid balance sheet of $3.4 billion in cash and investments, up more than $200 million versus a year ago, even after executing $947 million worth of share repurchases at a weighted average price of $42.63 throughout the year.Most importantly, we exit 2022 with our employee base in a far more stable place than where we started the year. Just under three years ago, we took advantage of our position as a primarily digital business with a heavy mix of engineering and product talent and committed to location flexibility permanently. That decision brought us more stability during the pandemic, and we continue to feel very good in our position as a cloud headquartered company which we define as having the flexibility of choosing where to live with the understanding that many jobs require periodic on-site gatherings, inter and intra team. We've been able to dramatically broaden our candidate pool and attract top talent from all over the country. Voluntary attrition declined steadily across the organization in 2022, down more than half in Q4 compared to Q1 and our workforce is more dispersed, more diverse and more engaged with 93% of our employees saying they clearly understand how their work is contributing to our mission.Further, our data shows that we're attracting talent at a much greater rate than before the pandemic four times more applicants per job posting versus 2019. Last and most important, we are seeing increases in productivity in critical areas of our business. Our Premier Agent sales team is more productive today than it was before the pandemic. Again, our software development and product teams are creating services faster today as well. So that was a little back in reflection on 2022. What about 2023? We are focused on our vision of building a housing super app, a single digital experience to help customers across all their real estate needs. Our goal is to increase engagement, increased customer transactions and increased revenue per transaction by investing across five growth pillars: touring, financing, seller solutions, enhancing our partner network and integrating our services.The expected output of this strategy is to grow our share of consumer transactions from 3% to 6% by the end of 2025. Critical to achieving our aspirations is building an integrated experience for customers and partners. We spent much of last year creating products and services across our five growth pillars and introducing them into our test markets as they became available. In 2023, we are ready to take the best of our learnings and roll them out market-by-market together across Raleigh, Denver, Atlanta and Phoenix in service of an integrated experience. With that as a backdrop, our first product road map update is touring. You've heard from us many times now that touring is a critical piece of the moving experience. It's the point-of-sale, where shoppers turn into transactors.And we know from all the data we see on a daily basis across our entire business that movers who request a tour convert to transactors at three times the rate of other actions on Zillow. Further, we believe improving the touring process is integral to building the seamless connected experience we envision. In late 2022, we rolled out real-time touring in Atlanta. Real-time touring is designed to make booking a home tour as easy as making a restaurant reservation online, a convenience that modern on-demand consumers certainly expect. We're excited about the early signs coming out of Atlanta, which show real-time touring enables higher connection rates and higher customer propensity to work with our Premier Agent partners, which we expect to drive benefits up and down the funnel, delivering high-intent customers to our partners.As a result of the early data we are seeing, we expanded this offering across Atlanta and are rolling out the product to our other three test markets. Of course, we have our eye on integration as well. Alongside the product improvements we are making every day to real-time touring, we've made it much easier for agents to transfer customers who are interested in financing to Zillow Home Loans loan officers as part of the touring experience. In Harmony, with state-of-the-art digital products and services, enhancing our partner network is critical to bringing our housing super app vision to live, which will be the focus of my second update. For years, we have driven increased lead volumes to our high-performing partner agents. We have done this in a variety of ways with an eye towards those who treat our customers best, who convert leads into transactions best and those that are excited about growing their businesses alongside us.We have taken our most aggressive steps in enhancing the network by meaningfully consolidating our partner network across all four test markets. We increasingly believe that a tighter set of partners allows us to deliver a better customer experience and allows us to test new products and services rapidly along the way in service of integration. One early success we've seen has come in Raleigh, North Carolina. Last quarter, we told you that in Raleigh, we were seeing approximately 15% customer adoption of Zillow Home Loans. We are happy to report that we are now seeing closer to 20% adoption just three months later. Based on our early successes in Raleigh, we have expanded our Zillow Home Loans adoption playbook to the rest of our test markets.Speaking of Zillow Home Loans, our next product road map update is on financing. We said many times before that we believe financing is crucial to the buyer's experience and merging financing at strategic points in the buyer's journey is critical to the end-to-end customer experience we envision. So in 2022, we turned our efforts towards building the foundation for a substantial direct-to-consumer purchase mortgage origination business. Last quarter, we spoke about the critical work streams we've deployed to bolster our mortgage business. In 2023, we have four key areas of focus. First, we are simplifying the entry points into our funnel and are building overall awareness of Zillow Home Loans. Second, we are building a better digital mortgage experience on Zillow to meet customers where they are in their buying journey.As a reminder, even with relatively low awareness for Zillow Home Loans, millions of customers on Zillow raised their hands for financing help last year, a testament to our brand and audience scale. Our focus is on improving our processes to better identify high intent customers and creating easy-to-use digital tools on our apps and sites to help our customers be ready-to-buy well before they tour homes. Third, we are bolstering our loan officer tools and capabilities so they can effectively handle our volume while providing a best-in-class customer experience. And finally, we're working closely with our Premier Agent partner base to build integrated processes with Zillow Home Loans, which I touched on a moment ago. As a reminder, we are building out two primary ways for customers to connect with Zillow Home Loans.The first way is financing first. It is when a customer starts their moving journey with financing to get pre-qualified before they are connected to an agent. We're investing here because we know approximately 40% of all homebuyers start their journey this way and roughly 80% of our prospective mortgage customers don't have a real estate agent. For many customers, financing is the most opaque and intimidating part of the home buying journey, and we want to help make it easier and more transparent on Zillow. We also know how valuable it is for our Premier Agent partners to be connected with the customer who already knows what they can afford. After many, many product changes last year, we are beginning to test connecting pre-qualified customers with Premier Agent partners in multiple markets, including all four test markets.The second way is property first. This is when our Zillow Home Loans lead comes back to us from a Premier Agent partner who was working with a home shopping customer we had previously sent them. Beyond the integration point with real-time touring we discussed earlier, we have integrated Zillow Home Loans into all existing connection processes across our four test markets. Encouragingly, we are already seeing nearly one in five Premier Agent partners sending connections to Zillow Home Loans in these markets and some agents outside of those markets are also proactively choosing to connect customers with us. From our perspective, the inherent value in integrated services has made our partners supportive of these efforts, and we are pleased with the early results.Photo by Ricardo Gomez Angel on UnsplashIn addition to the investments we're making in improving the buying experience, we're also delivering solutions for sellers and their listing agents, and we have some exciting product roadmap updates this quarter. Enabled by the small acquisition of VRX Media earlier this month, we launched listing Media Services through ShowingTime+, a photography service and comprehensive media package that enables listing agents to seamlessly deliver beautiful, immersive media for the homes they are selling. This service is a critical precursor to our upcoming listing showcase product, which we previewed last quarter. As a reminder, this product will differentiate a listing agent on Zillow through branding and a higher-quality listing that looks unlike anything else that exists on real estate sites today.Our aim with both of these products is to serve more sellers and allow listing agents to win more business. We will be rolling out listing showcase over the summer. We continue to be excited about the work that is happening here. We're also pleased to announce that our partnership with Opendoor is live in Atlanta and Raleigh. Customers who start their selling journey with Zillow can now request a cash offer from Opendoor and simultaneously receive an estimate of their open market home sale price with a local Premier Agent partner. All customers will work with one of Zillow's licensed advisers to determine the best path based on their needs so they can confidently sell their home and get into their next one, whether that's potentially maximizing sale price on the open market with the real estate agent, or being assured of a speedy sale with Opendoor.Regardless of the path, the customer chooses, they will be able to use the service as a stand-alone offering or package it with other Zillow services such as financing through Zillow home loans, working with the premiere agent partner to buy their next home or when it's available, closing with Zillow closing services. This new product experience will launch in additional markets nationwide over the course of 2023. Clearly, we have a lot of work ahead on our product road map. And of course, we are very conscious of the housing market environment while we invest for the future. Housing affordability challenges were of 2022 and remain front and center as we begin 2023. Affordability does impact demand. It also impacts supply. For homeowners, it's simply more expensive to move than to stay put right now, leaving more wood be movers on the sidelines.It's going to take time for these market dynamics to normalize. But as we head into 2023, we are seeing some early signs of stabilization, albeit at a meaningfully subdued level. Mortgage rates have come off their highs Home prices have continued to decelerate from their peak last June, and there is a looming backlog of homes under construction, both for sale homes and rentals, which is likely to give some help on affordability. However, we are not out of the woods yet given high uncertainty in the path of the macro economy and how it may affect the real estate industry. Things continue to be foggy and we can't control what the housing market does. What we can control is how we operate our business. Similar to many times in our history, including 2022, we are closely monitoring the situation and will be prudent in how we invest through this period.As we look back on the last 12 months, it is clear we were simultaneously navigating the past and organizing for the future. Now, however, we are eyes forward and focused. 2023 is a consequential year for us, and it is all about making progress on our initiatives through product launches and market rollouts so that we can further expand and scale into 2024. We see the same headlines you all see about tech companies cutting back their workforces to make up for staffing to unsustainable pandemic level growth that is now normalizing. Our story is different. After a year of significant people-related and other expense reductions in 2022, we are now investing during a very difficult housing market while others retrench as we see real opportunity for growth.We expect that 60 million homes will trade hands over the next 10 years, which reflects a much more natural and healthy mover rate. And given all the product and service innovation opportunities we have discussed, our aim is to be an increasing and meaningful share of those customer transactions. This will drive value for our customers, partners, employees and shareholders. We will continue to share our progress and learnings along the way, and we appreciate your partnership with us on this journey. I will now hand the line over to Allen. Allen?We plan to provide full year 2022 customer transaction share data in a future quarter as lagged county property records become available. We believe our Q4 Premier Agent revenue results also demonstrate the benefit of our continued focus and years of investments in our brand, customer experience and partner network, all things that we can control. We continually iterate and optimize our apps and sites on behalf of our customers and partners, and that became even more of a focus as teams have been freed up from iBuying. While each of the new features may seem small individually, over time, they add up and differentiate us. Our relative traffic growth has outperformed the next top 15 real estate sites combined as defined by comScore over the last several months.This has contributed to our overall relative outperformance in revenue when compared to the industry. Additionally, over the years, we have worked to refine our partner base by growing and rewarding high-performing agent partners. Rentals revenue was up 13% year-over-year as rentals traffic on Zillow grew 20% year-over-year to 26 million average monthly unique users in Q4 for comScore. Our industry-leading rentals traffic help us grow the number of multifamily properties on our platform despite an industry-wide decline in multifamily apartment renter searches and move rates. We believe macroeconomic factors, including both rental affordability and for-sale affordability challenges have pressured move rates and renter searches. This is partially offset by occupancy rates, which have continued to drift lower from historically high levels and continue to be a tailwind to the rental industry demand for advertising.IMT segment EBITDA was $113 million for Q4 or 27% of revenue, exceeding the high end of our outlook range of $100 million and 25% of revenue. The outperformance was primarily driven by better-than-expected Premier Agent revenue. Mortgages segment revenue of $18 million was near the midpoint of our outlook range as we continue to make progress building our Zillow Home Loans purchased mortgage business. Mortgages segment EBITDA was a loss of $32 million, near the high end of our outlook, as we continue to invest in building a better consumer-facing origination experience, efficient and scalable internal loan officer tools and back-end systems and integration with our Premier Agent business. We believe these investments lay the foundation for Zillow Home Loans to serve a much broader set of customers, many of whom we currently send to third-party lenders today.We expect financing will be a key driver behind growing our share of customer transactions and revenue per customer transaction. Total select operating expenses and cost of revenue, excluding share based compensation and depreciation and amortization were $362 million in Q4, up from $353 million in Q3. Consistent with our expectations implied in our outlook for the quarter. As we discussed on our Q3 earnings call, we are maintaining our planned investments in our key growth initiatives, partly offset by reductions from letting go a set of employees in October as well as other discretionary and non-people-related cost actions. We ended Q4 with $3.4 billion of cash and investments, down slightly from $3.5 billion in Q3, which includes the benefit from operating cash flow as well as the impact of $174 million in share repurchases during Q4 at an average price of $35 a share.We repurchased a total of 22 million shares for $947 million in 2022, which translates to an average share price of approximately $43 per share. Although the macro backdrop has been choppy, we continue to focus on the inputs we can control, adding value to our customers and shipping great products while prudently managing costs. We feel good about the progress we are making across our growth pillars and believe investing against our targets while managing costs is the right thing to do across this business cycle to drive share growth. Our relative brand strength at the top of the funnel, along with our balance sheet and focused growth strategy, enable us to continue to invest prudently. To align with our growth strategy and to better reflect the integrated platform of digitized solutions we are building, beginning with the first quarter of 2023, we plan to report our financial results as a single reportable segment.Within this framework, we plan to report revenue categories of residential, rentals, mortgages and other. These revenue categories are consistent with how we measure success against their respective industry total addressable markets. The new residential revenue category will primarily include revenue for Premier Agent and new construction marketplaces as well as StreetEasy for sale product offerings, Zillow Closing Services and ShowingTime+. Our rentals and mortgages revenue categories will remain consistent with historical presentation and other revenue will primarily include revenue generated from display advertising. Our cost will be reported in one consolidated segment, and we will report a single consolidated EBITDA, consistent with how we are operating the business.Silos have been broken down across lines of business teams to integrate towards providing customers and our partners' end-to-end solutions. Operations and investments across the business are intended to optimize consolidated revenue and consolidated EBITDA. We have provided a downloadable Excel version of select historical revenue data under this new presentation on our website within the supplemental financial tables and our interactive analyst center to help with modeling. These changes have no impact on historical consolidated total revenue or consolidated EBITDA. Turning to our outlook. Going forward, we are aligning our guidance with our new reporting structure and plan to provide outlook for residential revenue, total revenue and consolidated EBITDA, to help you transition to our new revenue categories, we also plan to provide Premier Agent revenue growth rates, and revenue growth rate outlook as we report over the next four quarters.For Q1, we expect total revenue to be $404 million to $437 million, implying a year-over-year decline of 22% at the midpoint of our outlook range. We expect residential revenue to be in the range of $313 million to $338 million. For Premier Agent, we estimate revenues will decline in the range of 23% to 28% year-over-year as compared to our estimate for an industry transaction dollar decline between 25% and 35% year-over-year in Q1. We expect consolidated EBITDA to be in the range of $48 million to $63 million, implying a 13% margin at the midpoint of our outlook rates. We continue to balance investments for future growth while managing discretionary costs during this challenging and uncertain macro environment. We have a high incremental margin business that should see leverage when the environment improves, which we demonstrated in both Q3 and Q4.Our Q1 EBITDA outlook assumes that from Q4 to Q1, we expect a modest increase in total operating expenses and cost of revenue. We expect this to be primarily driven by investments to support our recent acquisition of VRX Media and our new ShowingTime+ products. Our recent VRX Media acquisition has enabled us to accelerate our distribution plans for listing media services. In closing, entering 2023, we remain in a strong position to invest against our strategy to better serve more customers to drive customer transaction share and more revenue per customer transaction. As we look forward, our priorities remain focused on innovating and executing on behalf of our customers and partners, and we plan to grow our customer engagement through a compelling dream and shop experience, deliver a more integrated customer transactional experience to drive customers to choose to transact with us and our partners, invest in sustainable top line growth opportunities across the company, including new integrated services that are more scalable, less subject to earnings volatility and more capital efficient and manage our cost structure and improve productivity, including continued prioritization of our investments that we expect will drive a profitable, scalable and positive cash flow company.And with that operator, we'll open the line for questions.","February 17, 2023 at 3:15 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zillow-group-inc-nasdaq-z-211558434.html,Insider Monkey,0.0,0.0,0.16202550395732207,0.43166113516113536

ZG,Zillow Group (ZG) Beats Earnings and Revenue Estimates in Q4,"Zillow Group, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Zillow Group, Inc. QuoteDuring the quarter, Zillow recorded a gross profit of $346 million compared with $440 million in the prior-year quarter. The decline is primarily due to lower revenues. The operating expenses during the quarter were $429 million, up from $408 million in the prior-year quarter.  Adjusted EBITDA was $73 million compared with $154 million in the prior-year quarter, primarily driven by a significant fall in adjusted EBITDA in the IMT segment.For the full year 2022, Zillow generated $4,504 million cash from operating activities against $3,177 million cash utilization in the prior-year period. As of Dec 31, 2022, the company had $1,466 million in cash and cash equivalents with $139 million of lease liabilities, net of the current portion compared with respective tallies of $2,315 million and $148 million in the prior-year period.For the first quarter of 2023, Zillow estimates total revenue to be in the range of $404-$437 million, indicating a 22% year-over-year decline. Total adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $48 million to $63 million. Within the IMT segment, the company anticipates Premier Agent revenue to decline in the range of 23% to 28% year over year. Management expects a modest increase in operating expenditures and cost of revenues owing to investments in VRX media and the company’s new ShowingTime+ products.Jabil, Inc.

ZG,Gen Z Is Investing in Real Estate: These 6 Cities Have the Most Affordable Homes,"Despite their interest in buying a home, key findings in the report indicate Gen Z is experiencing challenges in the path to homeownership. For example, 34% of Gen Zers surveyed cited finding the right home to buy as their biggest challenge. Another 26% surveyed struggle with a lack of homes for sale.Toledo offers potential buyers a 5:1 estimated inventory-to-buyer ratio. The percent of listings with a price cut is at 23% and the typical mortgage payment as a percentage of income is 26% as of October 2022.""A first-time homebuyer could purchase a home under $200,000 in Philadelphia in many areas which are move-in ready,"" said Rosenthal.Additionally, Rosenthal said Philadelphia has everything Gen Zers could want. This includes a strong job market, proximity to major cities like Washington D.C. and New York City and countless attractions, including visiting historic sites and partaking in delicious food.Currently, there aren't a lot of available homes to purchase in Windsor Locks. However, the available single-family houses for sale are between $250,000 to $400,000. Most homes are also within walking or biking distance from downtown Windsor Locks and the town itself is appealing to Gen Zers seeking a more affordable alternative to living in major cities like New York City or Boston.A number of outstanding factors make the state of Texas wildly popular across all generations. Texas has a strong economy and job market, no income tax, low cost-of-living expenses and affordable housing.Gen Z has a wide range of cities available to choose from in Texas, but they may decide to head for El Paso. Ranking at number two on Realtor's Top Housing Markets for 2023, the median home price was $291,000 in November 2022. Since then, the home price change has only increased by 5.4%.With an estimated 4:1 home inventory-to-buyer ratio, homes in this city will receive an average of two offers and sell in around 26 days. The city is home to several major corporations and to destinations like the Gateway Arch, Busch Stadium and theme parks to ensure Gen Zers work hard and play hard.Just 20 minutes west of Salt Lake City, Magna is close enough to the city for Gen Zers who need to commute, offers proximity to ski resorts for leisure and may be an ideal fit for young families looking to buy their first home.More From GOBankingRatesCostco's Best Deals?

ZG,"Living Alone Can Cost You As Much As $19,500 More a Year Vs. Sharing Space, Says Zillow","“Living alone has its perks — you never have to share a bathroom, you have a claim to the TV at all times, and dirty dishes can stack up as long as you want, judgment free. But all that freedom comes with a cost,” Amanda Pendleton, Zillow home trends expert, said in the release. “Even though rent prices are starting to cool, they are still significantly higher than they were a year ago. Renters considering going solo this year must decide how valuable living alone is to them, and if the cost is worth it.”Zillow calculated the “singles tax” by using the annual amount that one person would pay in rent and divided that number in half, which is the additional amount singles pay when they do not split that rent with a partner or roommate, according to the release.And that “tax” varies depending on where you live, with New York City having the highest one — singles pay $19,500 more a year than someone living with a partner in the same place, which increases to nearly $24,000 in Manhattan, the priciest borough.San Francisco is not cheap either, as it has a $14,000 “singles tax” for a one-bedroom apartment.On the other hand, in terms of large cities, Detroit and Cleveland have the lowest “singles tax” at $4,483 and $4,387 respectively.More From GOBankingRates8 Places in California Where Home Prices Have PlummetedFood Stamps: What Is the Highest Income Level for SNAP Payments in February?The 10 Best Balance Transfer Credit Cards for 20238 Steps To Improve Your Finances in One Year","February 16, 2023 at 8:52 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/living-alone-cost-much-19-145241359.html,GOBankingRates,0.35,0.35,0.13207919531448942,0.4293990323402088
ZG,"Expect a competitive shopping season, despite few available homes","Though easing mortgage rates are bringing buyers back, don't expect the fervor of recent yearsBuyers should expect to face intensifying competition over the next few months.Homeowners are largely staying put, so attractive listings will see strong interest.Affordability remains the biggest challenge for buyers and sellers, with both keeping a close eye on mortgage rates.On the sellers' side, well-priced, well-marketed homes will receive attractive offers during their first weekend on the market, but many listings will take longer and will need price cuts to sell. Last month, 22% of listings saw a price cut, more than any January since at least 2018.Buyers and sellers waiting for home prices to either plunge or skyrocket will be disappointed. Instead, prices are forecast to move on a slow, boring trajectory like they have historically, and inch a little higher in spring after seasonal winter lows.While heat in the housing market has ticked up in the past few months, there's no guarantee it will continue along this path. The courses of inflation, unemployment and especially mortgage rates will determine what comes next.Mortgage rates will affect both demand and supply significantly. If rates move lower, toward 6% or below, they will bring more buyers into the fold and make it more palatable for homeowners to sell, increasing supply. If rates hover in the upper 6% range or above, buyers may once again put their house hunt on hold.""The housing turnaround since November has coincided with what are typically the weakest three months of the year — forecasting the future off that can be dicey,"" Tucker said.

KimGary SwidlerOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from James Heaney with Jefferies.James Edward HeaneyJust for Gary, can you talk specifically about the encouraging signs that you're seeing at Tinder in April? Is that primarily around the success you're seeing on price increases? Or are there other specific optimizations that are driving the uplift?Gary SwidlerOperatorOur next question comes from Ygal Arounian with Citi.Ygal ArounianBernard J. KimOperatorOur next question comes from Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer.Jason Stuart HelfsteinSo can you talk about the Tinder price testing in a bit more detail, why you feel confident that this is the right move strategically? I completely understand about the weekly, but the idea of just like the price increase at the kind of the longer-term plans, more premium. And then you used the word additional color on what significant meant. And then just secondly, more for housekeeping, but how are you thinking about -- specifically about second half Tinder net adds?Gary SwidlerOperatorOur next question comes from Dan Salmon with New Street Research.Bernard J. KimDan, are you there? We can't hear you.Daniel SalmonThere you go. Sorry about that. Can you hear me now?Bernard J. KimWe can.Daniel SalmonBernard J. KimGary SwidlerOperatorOur next question comes from Shweta Khajuria with Evercore ISI.Shweta R. KhajuriaCould you please talk about Hinge? You're guiding to $400 million in annual revenues. You're reiterating your guide. How should we think about Hinge's sustainable growth and margin profile as an asset? And what gives you confidence that Hinge and Tinder both can grow concurrently?Gary SwidlerShweta R. KhajuriaYes, that's helpful.OperatorOur next question comes from John Blackledge with Cowen.John Ryan BlackledgeI thought there was interesting color in the shareholder letter on Tinder's paying user opportunity in North America, in Europe in the 18-to-34 demo. Given Tinder's recent paying user growth challenges, what do you see as kind of key drivers of getting both the lapsed and/or never-been users to the platform? And as a follow-up, it feels like what you laid out implies there's ample runway over time for further Tinder payer -- paying user growth.Gary SwidlerOperatorOur next question comes from Lauren Schenk with Morgan Stanley.Lauren Elizabeth Cassel SchenkMaybe just one on Hinge. As we think about international expansion, I think you're now in all the major markets in Europe, how are you thinking about second half expansion? Any thoughts or timing around when the app might enter Asia, understanding those markets are still a little bit difficult right now.Bernard J. KimOperatorOur next question comes from Alexandra Steiger with Goldman Sachs.Alexandra Christine Kasper SteigerSo in the context of your Q2 revenue guide, which anticipates low single-digit growth, can you give us a bit more color on how we should think about the building blocks of your updated '23 revenue guide? What are the different assumptions that went into the guide initially? And how did these evolve since the last update? And then lastly, what are some potential areas of upside or downside when thinking through '23 revenue growth?Gary SwidlerOperatorOur next question comes from Benjamin Black with Deutsche Bank.Benjamin Thomas BlackJust pivoting to costs, where you obviously reiterated the guide for AOI margins to be at least flat in '23. So if we look beyond app store fee changes, what are the major swing factors that could drive upside or downside there? Is there room to tighten up the cost structure any further? And how should we be thinking about the trade-off between revenue growth and expense moderation at the legacy brands? What's sort of baked into your outlook there?Gary SwidlerOperatorOur next question comes from Justin Patterson with KeyBanc.Justin Tyler PattersonPerhaps a multipart big-picture question. BK, you're not alone in saying AI is a meaningful platform shift like mobile. Match does have a solid history of navigating platform shifts, albeit with new brands often emerging and legacy brands slowing. Can you tease out how you think this can transform the dating experience and how it changes the opportunity set through the existing brands and some new ones you're incubating? Is this something you can build organically or acquire your way into? And then for Gary, how does AI change your expense profile over time?Bernard J. KimGary SwidlerOperatorOur next question comes from Brad Erickson with RBC.Bradley D. EricksonGary SwidlerOperatorOur next question comes from Cory Carpenter with JPMorgan.Cory Alan CarpenterGary, you touched on the app stores a bit in your prepared remarks, but hoping you could expand on your thoughts around some of the developments like the Epic and Apple's appeals or like Google's concessions in the U.K., et cetera and just what you think the potential impact could be to Match.Gary SwidlerOperatorThe last question will come from Thomas Doheny with Stifel.Thomas James DohenyI just have one quickly. Is it possible to get a little bit more color on the new app that you guys are launching this summer?Bernard J. KimOperatorThe conference has now concluded.

MTCH,25 Best Cities for Singles in the U.S.,"One area of daily living that technology has managed to disrupt is dating. Gone are the days when men and women had to actually go out and meet strangers to find that perfect match. Instead, applications like Tinder let you browse through user profiles simply through the palm of your hand, and, if you're lucky, match up with a potential partner.Naturally, these players operate on a global level, and their scale makes it difficult for incumbents to launch alternatives on a similar scale. Some of the newer entrants in the industry are Snack, a video dating application; Thursday, a rather interesting application that is available only on Thursdays; Heart to Heart, an application that lets users also send voice notes to each other; and Schmooze which lets you match on meme choice. Looking at this handful of examples, it's clear that newer entrants are getting creative with their applications to wrest away market share from the larger companies. Additionally, just as small businesses can benefit from targeting the right local markets, so can these companies, especially since dating is a local phenomenon. After all, you're unlikely to match or go out with someone from Tokyo if you're living in New York. Some strategies for small businesses targeting local markets that those in the dating industry can also follow include developing a unique selling proposition, separating the market by geography, and evaluating the market in terms of growth potential.We expect the company overall as well as Tinder to have accelerating year-over-year revenue growth as we move through 2023 driven by improved product execution leading to improved revenue momentum at Tinder. In terms of AOI, we expect improving year-over-year margins in the back half of the year as the benefits of our cost savings initiatives take hold and Tinder top line growth accelerates. Our cost savings initiatives are focused on rightsizing headcount and reducing overhead costs, including office expenses and professional fees. We expect to reduce our global workforce by approximately 8% in aggregate. We’ve already reduced roles in the U.S. In other countries, this process is ongoing. We expect to incur $6 million of severance and similar costs related to our cost savings initiatives in 2023.With these details in mind, let's take a look at some of the best cities in America for singles.Our MethodologyInsider Monkey's Score: 21.2 Houston is one of the largest cities in Texas in terms of population.Insider Monkey's Score: 21Durham is one of the most populous cities in North Carolina.

MTCH,Match Group (MTCH) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: Should You Buy?,"Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when Match Group (MTCH) reports results for the quarter ended March 2023. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on May 2. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis media and internet company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.40 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -46%.Revenues are expected to be $794.58 million, down 0.5% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.63% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Match Group?For Match Group, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +7.50%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Match Group will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Match Group would post earnings of $0.47 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.30, delivering a surprise of -36.17%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Match Group appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAmong the stocks in the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry, Overstock.com (OSTK) is soon expected to post loss of $0.16 per share for the quarter ended March 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -176.2%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $358.48 million, down 33.1% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Overstock has been revised 142.1% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -10.42%.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Overstock will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed EPS estimates just once.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Match Group Inc.

MTCH,10 Growth Stocks Jim Cramer is Talking About,"""Nobody can blame the Fed for slowing down the pace of its rate hikes. Until a few weeks ago, we didn't care that so many banks had taken their Covid-boosted deposits and invested them in longer-term bonds that were practically guaranteed to take losses in the event of aggressive rate hikes, which we got. We didn't have a clue that old-fashioned bank runs could happen so swiftly.""""In a sluggish economy, the Wall Street playbook says you buy tech, but not just any tech. You buy tech that's brimming with cash and doesn't need to tap the equity or bond markets.

MTCH,10 Cheap Social Media Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds,"In 2023, the advertising revenue for TikTok and Douyin, which are social platforms owned by ByteDance, is expected to increase by 24.5%. As a result, ByteDance's share of worldwide digital advertising expenditure is predicted to reach 5.8%, which is more significant than the combined share of LinkedIn, Snapchat, Twitter, and YouTube. Moreover, by 2023, the total monthly user base for both apps is estimated to reach 1.70 billion users, which will make up 36.5% of all internet users globally and 45.2% of all social network users.

(NASDAQ:YY) but lowered the firm's price target on the shares to $49 from $62 on March 17. The company's Q4 results were reported as ""moderately above-expectation,"" but there is still a lack of visibility for FY23, leading the firm to adjust its estimates cautiously. The analyst explained that this approach was taken due to the uncertainty surrounding the company's future performance.“We exited YY after 3.5 years near an all-time high. The annualized return (13~%) is below expectation, especially compared to founder CEO David Xueling Li’s net worth (mainly in YY shares) ballooning from $1.1B in 2018 to $2.3B in 2021. On value realization, I think YY did a good job, acquiring Bigo, spinning off then selling Huya & selling YY Live to Baidu. But as a minority shareholder, we were treated unfairly. E.g. the Bigo deal (for buying shares from executives including Li) was done by YY stock when the price was severely depressed, causing significant dilution for our ownership. We learned our lessons and will evaluate more rigorously in management’s partnership mindset in the future.”Number of Hedge Fund Holders: N/AP/E Ratio as of April 4: 18.56Tencent Holdings Limited (OTC:TCEHY) is an investment holding company that delivers value-added services and online advertising services in China and internationally.

ADIF, Match and the CCI did not respond to requests for comment.The Competition Commission of India (CCI) in October imposed a $113 million fine on Google and said it must allow the use of third-party billing and stop forcing developers to use its in-app payment system that charges commission of 15%-30%.Google later decided to start offering User Choice Billing (UCB) for allowing alternative payments alongside Google's when purchasing in-app digital content, but the ADIF said in its filing that this new system imposes a ""service fee"".""The app developers will have to pay 1%-3% for alternate payment service providers and 11%-26% to Google, which makes the entire ecosystem unsustainable,"" ADIF said.Match in its March 21 filing asked the CCI to direct Google not to collect or impose any commission or service fee, including via user choice billing, saying the system was ""anti-competitive"".Google, which counts India as a major growth market, faces other regulatory challenges, including a setback that forced it to change how it markets its Android system.In an order in October, the CCI said Google abused its market position and its mandatory imposition of the proprietary payment system limited the scope of payment processors and app developers for technical development and innovation.Google has challenged this in an Indian tribunal.ADIF, which represents Indian startups including digital payments firm Paytm and social media app ShareChat, in its March complaint alleged that Google was using the new service fee system to bypass the antitrust directive that ordered it not to impose any ""unfair and disproportionate"" conditions.""The policy of UCB is unfair and the same would lead to unjust enrichment to Google,"" the ADIF filing said.

MTCH,15 Free Dating Sites in USA Without Payment: 2023 List,"Online dating is a phenomenon that has long prevailed on the internet, with more people becoming interested in the idea each year. With social media and the internet making it possible for people to bridge barriers and interact with others all across the globe, online dating has steadily gained popularity. Additionally, with the world rapidly becoming more career-oriented, a glaring reality is becoming more evident: people barely have the time to meet like-minded others and develop lasting relationships with them. As a result, most young and ambitious people busy with professional lifestyles have also begun adding to the user base of various online dating websites.In many ways, analysts were right to expect dating website companies to turn a profit in 2022, as seen by the performance of Bumble Inc.

Such performance is undoubtedly aided by the ever-growing interest in, and popularity of, online dating.With more single people across the globe looking for a quick way to find lasting relationships in light of unrelenting professional lives, it is understandable that this trend is becoming more popular. At the same time, there is a sense of unease associated with online dating because users may be worried about not finding the right matches without real-life interactions.

MTCH,15 Most Promising Stocks to Buy According to Analysts,"The international financial system is yet again wavering amid the banking sector problems. Analysts are now processing the possibility of the current turmoil spreading to other banks. European Central Bank Vice President Luis de Guindos told finance ministers last week that EU banks could be vulnerable to rising interest rates. On the other hand, The European Central Bank, defying expectations, went ahead with a planned half-point increase in interest rates.  Some analysts believe the consistent rise in interest rates could hammer other European banks, creating a risk of a wider economic turmoil.The BlackRock report said:“The stock market can be volatile in the short term. It can decline substantially in a single day, creating fear amongst investors. But if you stay calm, you’ll find that the likelihood of a positive return grows higher the longer you stay invested.”Almost everyone emphasizes the importance of long-term investing, but few have practiced this investment philosophy better than Oracle of Omaha Warren Buffett. In his latest investor letter, Warren Buffett reiterated the importance of long-term investing.“Our goal in both forms of ownership is to make meaningful investments in businesses with both long-lasting favorable economic characteristics and trustworthy managers. Please note particularly that we own publicly-traded stocks based on our expectations about their long-term business performance, not because we view them as vehicles for adroit purchases and sales. That point is crucial: Charlie and I are not stock-pickers; we are business-pickers.”Our MethodologyFor this article, we first used the Finviz stock screener to screen for stocks whose average analyst price estimate is 50% more than their current price targets. We sorted the resultant dataset in descending order of market cap and started choosing stocks for this article from the top. We skipped highly volatile and risky stocks in the current environment, including banks, and preferred high-growth companies with actual long-term growth catalysts. We checked these companies’ one-year average price estimates on their Yahoo Finance pages and picked 15 stocks with the highest upside potential from their current levels based on these price targets.Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 28One-Year Average Price Estimate: $127.24Sony Group Corporation (NYSE:SONY) is one of the most promising stocks according to analysts amid the Chinese company's increasing presence in entertainment, gaming and other sectors. In February, Sony Group Corporation (NYSE:SONY) posted its fiscal Q3 results. GAAP EPS in the period came in at ¥263.89. Revenue in the quarter increased by about 12.5% on a YoY basis.Insider Monkey’s proprietary database of 943 hedge funds and their holdings shows that 28 hedge funds were invested in Sony Group Corporation (NYSE:SONY) at the end of the fourth quarter of 2022. The biggest stakeholder of Sony was Mario Gabelli’s GAMCO Investors which owns a $124 million stake in Sony Group Corporation (NYSE:SONY).Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 29One-Year Average Price Estimate: $31.75EV company Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) is one of the most promising stocks according to analysts. Earlier this month, BofA started covering Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) with a $40 price target and a Buy rating. The price target was less than BofA’s previous price target of $50, but nonetheless represents an upside potential from the current levelsDespite some headwinds and concerns, BofA believes Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) remains one of the most viable EV stocks.Rivian Automotive, Inc. is an EV manufacturer producing vehicles for the consumer and corporate delivery van markets. Its shares were under pressure during the quarter.

MTCH,"Bumble: Dating apps seeing some upside limit to user growth, analyst explains","Citi Director of Internet Equity Research Ygal Arounian joins Yahoo Finance Live to analyze Bumble's position in the online dating space and how the dating app and competitors — like the Match Group — may be experiencing slowing user growth.So Bumble, if you take a look at the performance, went off over 30% over the past year, hasn't done much since the start of the year. Why do you like him?They've been-- it's been taking share quite materially from Tinder and some of the other apps over the last couple of years. We think they can continue that share gain. A lot of the brand message from Bumble really resonates well, particularly with younger audiences, who think that app is well positioned to take share within online dating. And that's really the crux of why we like it here right now.The brand also tends to resonate a little bit better with younger audiences right now. And there's a lot of focus on Gen Z and getting Gen Z to adapt, one app over the other right now. For Match, it's by far the biggest asset that is Tinder and really Tinder is the biggest dating app within that online dating ecosystem by a wide margin. And it's seeing some opposite kind of momentum there.It's lost a lot subscribers last quarter. It's expected to lose them again this quarter, some specific dynamics going on there. But in general, it's been losing share of time spent, on the amount of time people spend on dating apps overall. It's lost some share. It's lost some share internally to another Match app, Hinge, but it's also lost some of that share to Bumble.So right now, we're seeing is a big battle for market share. Overall, the amount of time spent on these dating apps overall has really been flat to slightly down over the last couple of years. So we've-- you know, feel like maybe have hit some level of cap on the amount of time people are willing to spend on the apps overall. And that's why this shift in market share has become really important.There are some pressure on the amount of subscriptions and how much people are willing to spend on subscriptions. That's stabilized to a certain extent. So it's still lower than it was when times were better, hasn't gotten incrementally worse.So there's some kind of base level that people are willing to spend to meet people and go out and try to find the right person. But there is also a limit to how much they are willing to spend, and people do tighten up their wallets to a certain extent, even for online dating.So I think, in general, you are seeing some upside limit to how many users we see collectively here. The other thing that's happened is the space has gotten more competitive.When Tinder first blew up, it was really the only large dating app that was geared towards younger audiences, and now you're seeing more and more of those. So landscape's got more fragmented. And as people spend time on more apps than they used to, it's not all incremental. So some of the time that you're going to spend on one app is going to likely come at the expense on another app.So that conversion of those free users to paying users is I think is as important as it's ever been in this space. And it's largely because of that point that we are at-- I'm not going to call it full maturity, but there's some level of maturity that we've seen over the past number of years, and there's a lot of focus on conversion right now.","March 17, 2023 at 2:52 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/bumble-dating-apps-seeing-upside-205204249.html,Yahoo Finance Video,0.0,0.0,0.14128737068877917,0.3985188911245248

MTCH,"Market bottom may be near, according to Michael Burry. Here are 2 stocks that may have already bottomed","Referring back to the October bank panic of 1907, Burry notes certain similarities with today’s crisis. The 1907 panic was triggered by the collapse of a major regional bank, Knickerbocker, in New York, which expanded to hit two other regional institutions and then threatened to spread to the banking majors. But, Burry points out, the 1907 panic burned itself out quickly. The market hit bottom in just three weeks.Describing the incident, Burry wrote, “In October 1907, Knickerbocker Trust failed due to risky bets, sparking a panic. Two others soon failed, and it spread. When a run began on a healthy Trust, JPMorgan made a stand. 3 weeks later the Panic resolved & markets bottomed. A stand was made this past weekend.”It remains to be seen whether history will repeat itself. Meanwhile, the Wall Street analysts have pointed out two stocks that are already in the ‘buy’ zone. These are equities that have been flirting with their own bottom levels lately, but offer solid upside potential going forward. We ran them through the TipRanks database to see what makes them appealing investment choices right now.We’ll start with Match Group, a holding company in the online world, known as the parent firm for some of the internet’s most popular dating sites. Match’s subsidiaries include the eponymous match.com, as well as names like Tinder and OKCupid. In the industry, Match is known for having introduced the now-ubiquitous ‘swipe’ feature to mobile dating apps, and the company now boasts that its brands are known world-wide, offered in 40 languages, and available for all dating demographic groups.While Match can claim that Tinder, its largest brand, was the world’s top-grossing lifestyle and dating app in 2022, the company’s stock has still fallen in the past year. Over the last 12 months, shares in MTCH are down by 60%.Even though revenue and earnings missed expectations, Barclays analyst Mario Lu remains sanguine about Match’s prospects going forward, noting that the company is good at generating cash, and has several positive fundamentals in a difficult environment.“We believe MTCH has effectively transitioned from an Internet growth stock over the past few years to now a value stock due to its high-margin profile and strong cash flow generation. While there is continued risk that Tinder payer growth does not recover by 2H23 if macro continues to weaken, we believe the company’s strategy in FY23 to focus on optimizations to drive payer growth is a prudent one that was highly effective in the past,” Lu opined.“We view limited relative downside for MTCH stock to the rest of our coverage due to 1) its profitable business model in a tightening credit environment, 2) our view of Tinder payer growth concerns as overblown, and 3) upside on higher priced subscription tiers /advertising revenue opportunity and gross margin benefits from potential lowered/bypassing App Store fees,” the analyst added.The second beaten-down stock we’re looking at is Truist Financial, a ‘top 10’ commercial bank in the US market, with a market cap of $43 billion and total assets exceeding $555 billion. The firm is based in Charlotte, North Carolina, and offers a full range of banking products and services to both retail and small business clients. Truist’s services include wealth management, specialized lending, corporate and investment banking, and commercial banking.This bank’s shares are down 44% for the past 12 months – but by far the lion’s share of that stock price decline has come since the March 8 collapse of SVB.That share price drop shows how ‘black swan’ events can overshadow sound financial performance. Truist saw positive results in both revenues and earnings in 4Q22. The top line of $6.3 billion marked a 12% y/y gain, while the bottom line non-GAAP EPS of $1.20 was up 5.3% from the prior year. Even better, both results were above the analyst forecasts; the top line beat by $50 million, while the bottom line EPS beat by 2 cents.In February, Truist declared its regular quarterly dividend. The payment was set at 52 cents per common share, the third in a row at this level; Truist has raised the dividend twice in the last 3 years. The payment went out on March 1, and the annualized rate of $2.08 gives a solid yield of 6.3%, about triple the average found among S&P-listed firms, and a third of a percentage point above the current rate of inflation.Baird analyst David George, in his coverage of Truist, explains why he believes this bank will avoid the bullet that hit SVB.“We believe the depository issues at SIVB won’t reverberate through the banking sector and were a function of the bank’s niche deposit base rather than a systemic issue. In contrast, TFC’s Southeastern footprint offers one of the most attractive core customer bases in the US… While other banks may struggle to generate PPNR growth in 2H23 and FY2024, we believe TFC’s strong fee business units (namely insurance and investment banking) should drive growth and normalizing activity in mortgage and capital markets activity could represent a significant tailwind,” George opined.","March 17, 2023 at 7:46 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/market-bottom-may-near-according-134647654.html,TipRanks,0.1,0.4,0.07444149685003341,0.3900425455303504

MTCH,15 Best 52-Week Low Stocks To Buy Now,"2022 was terrible for the equities market, as inflation reached new highs and took interest rates with it. The Fed showed no signs of slowing down until the fourth quarter of 2022. 2023 got off to a decent start as the Fed issued a less aggressive rate hike and raised interest rates by 25 basis points at the February meeting. However, inflation is still running at roughly 3 times the target rate of 2%. Economists and analysts are divided on what the Fed will do at the next FOMC meeting in March and what is ahead for the economy.""Part of the endgame is, we do wanna see a enough of a downturn to make stocks attractive, to cause this cathartic moment, where we can reset and multiples can begin expanding as the economic cycle turns. But we're still a ways from that. However, I would suggest whereas people were thinking this could last into '24, it does feel like the downturn is closer than we thought a week ago.""Photo by Ruben Sukatendel on UnsplashOur MethodologyTo determine the best 52-week low stocks to buy now, we sifted through the 52-week low stocks list compiled by Yahoo Finance.

MTCH,The state of dating apps amid recessionary concerns,"Yahoo Finance tech reporter Allie Garfinkle details how popular dating apps are navigating customers' recessionary concerns.[AUDIO LOGO]And I think it's worth running through the world of companies that we're dealing with here. Now, it's important to say there is a 900-pound, 800-pound, 1,000-pound gorilla in the room, and that is Match. Match has a number of brands that we're all going to be familiar with, the most famous of them, of course, is Tinder.Now Tinder is something that we've come to associate with dating apps, but it actually hasn't had the easiest time. Tinder last year actually drove the company's first ever quarterly loss. So one of the things about Tinder right now, is there's a turnaround story they're looking for. They need to make the app more inclusive for women, Gen Z, and really get monetization right.Tinder's revenue last quarter per payer actually declined 2%. So Tinder, despite the fact that's what we associate with, isn't the most, isn't proving to be the most resilient. Now, you have Bumble, on the other hand, which is the female-friendly one. We've all seen the ads. And it's important to say that the important thing about Bumble-- You're having a thought, Dave.And the last one that's worth mentioning is Hello Group. They have Tantan, which is called The Tinder of China, which has also had some Tinder-like problems. At the end of 2021, they actually saw their revenue plunge 40%. So it's actually, despite the fact that this is kind of a sexy, fun space, it hasn't proven to be the easiest one to manage.It's also about nascent markets, right. Market expansion. Bumble, for instance, has to get better at localizing and going international, whereas you have something like Hinge, for example, that has to expand internationally. Like for instance, Bumble, I think a couple of them are eyeing India as a key market.So I think what we're going to see over time, is that these apps are going to try to expand and localize for certain people, for certain communities, for certain countries. And that's probably where the future is, because presumably, if it's working, people leave.","February 14, 2023 at 3:54 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/state-dating-apps-amid-recessionary-215439946.html,Yahoo Finance Video,0.0,0.0,0.24206349206349198,0.4366402116402115

MTCH,Time to Buy These 3 Internet -Commerce Stocks?,"Among the Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) list several internet commerce stocks are standing out with earnings estimate revisions on the rise.With the Internet-Commerce Industry currently in the top 11% of over 250 Zacks Industries here is a look at some of the top-rated stocks in the space to consider buying amid the strong start to 2023.Alibaba BABA Starting the list is Alibaba, which has been among the Zacks Rank #1 Strong Buys since January 18 with its stock climbing considerably during this time. Following the reopening of China’s economy, Alibaba has been one of the pack leaders among Chinese stocks that have soared over the last few months.Alibaba’s fiscal 2023 earnings are now expected at $7.20 per share which would be a -13% drop from a year ago but FY24 earnings are forecasted to rebound and climb 15% to $8.28 a share. Even better, earnings estimate revisions have started to go up again for FY23 with FY24 estimates up 5% over the last quarter.Earnings estimates continuing to rise for Alibaba is a good sign as BABA stock is up +52% in the last three months to easily outpace the S&P 500’s +11%. Plus, trading around $106 a share Alibaba stock still trades attractively relative to its past at 18.5X forward earnings. This is 72% below its historical high of 66.6X and a 50% discount to the median of 36.9X another indication that there could be more upside from current levels.JD.com JDJD.com is another Chinese internet-commerce stock that may also have more upside with its stock skyrocketing in the past few months as well. Over the last three months, JD stock is up +30% to beat the benchmark and has been on par with the Electronic Commerce Markets +31% despite trailing Alibaba’s +52%.More impressive, since going public in 2014, JD stock is now up +187% which has topped Alibaba’s +13% during this period and the S&P 500’s +124% and shows the company is very much a viable option in regards to E-commerce growth in China.With the enormous size of China’s population, there is certainly enough room for both Alibaba and JD.com as elite players in regard to direct-to-consumer product sales through their online platforms. To that note, JD.com’s earnings estimates have gone up for its current fiscal 2022 and FY23.Fiscal 2022 earnings are now projected to climb 44% to $2.44 per share compared to EPS of $1.69 in FY21. Fiscal 2023 earnings are forecasted to rise another 14%. Trading at $57 a share and 27X forward earnings JD stock trades well below its absurd historical high of 2,100.5X and at a 60% discount to the median of 68.9X. Rounding out the list is North American-based dating platform operator Match Group which was recently added to the strong buy list along with JD.com.With earnings estimates trending higher, Match stock is starting to stick out as MTCH is still 67% off its 52-week highs. While there is no guarantee Match will eclipse a very impressive high of $118.95 per share last February, fiscal 2023 earnings are projected to climb an impressive 72% to $2.15 per share compared to EPS of $1.25 in FY22.Plus, FY24 earnings are projected to jump another 14% with MTCH stock trading at $48 per share and 24.4X forward earnings. This is 90% below its historical high of 249X and a 43% discount to the median of 43.2X with Match stock now up 15% over the last month to top the recent rallies in the broader indexes.Bottom LineWith these Internet-Commerce stocks trading attractively relative to their past, the rising earnings estimate revisions are a great sign that there could still be more upside left after their recent rallies.

MTCH,"Match Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:MTCH) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript","One thing that was very obvious is that this organization welcomes change and embraces the cultural shift that is required to drive shareholder value, while serving our mission to create real and meaningful connections every day. The changes we made at Tinder have allowed it to quickly regain footing and prioritize product momentum. The results are evident in Tinder's 2023 roadmap and improved execution. No other brand in the category has the virality, the reach and the scale that Tinder has. While it might take a few quarters, I'm confident by shoring up the talent there and judiciously investing in the team and the brand that we're going to accelerate Tinder's momentum and get us back to the financial performance that we all expect. I remain the Interim CEO of Tinder and key senior leaders continue to report directly to me.I'm encouraged by the progress that Tinder has made both culturally and in terms of execution. In fact, in the second half of the year, Tinder saw a significant increase in the number of product features it delivered compared to the first half of 2022. I'm also very excited for the new marketing campaign which launches later in Q1. This will allow us to begin shifting and establishing Tinder's brand story. After Tinder, we looked at the rest of the organization. From every conversation I had with our brand leaders, it became evident that Match Group had historically operated in a very siloed way. I'm a big believer that by increasing transparency across the organization, you increase accountability, while at the same time adding a healthy dose of friendly competition to the company's culture.That's why we announced last week that we revamped our leadership structure to create a more streamlined organization. With a focus on setting up the right team for the future, we restructured the management team around leaders with extensive knowledge and experience supplemented with new talent that brings a renewed focus on innovation and growth. Hinge remains a standout in our portfolio, guided by Justin McLeod's founder-led mentality and mission-focused vision for the brand. Hinge continued its highly successful international expansion efforts becoming one of the top 3 most downloaded dating apps across English speaking DACH and Nordic countries in December. It will also launch its new premium subscription tier HingeX to all users by the end of February.I've been impressed with Hinge's ability to create a differentiated, powerful dating app that resonates with so many singles across generations, and now expand their monetization by offering two subscription tiers that give users more control over how they date. Hinge is still very early in its international expansion and monetization efforts, but I believe there is a lot of upside as we continue to invest in the brand. I'm excited about our opportunities within Asia and the strong focus we have now in the region. We needed a product focused leader on the ground in the market, who knows how to engage and inspire teams. So I promoted Malgosia Green from Plenty of Fish to a newly created role as CEO of Match Group Asia. Malgosia will be moving to Asia to work directly with Pairs and Hyperconnect to recapture growth and enhance profitability, as well as drive the go-to-market strategies for Hinge and Tinder across the region.Finally, Evergreen & Emerging Brands which consist of Match, Meetic, Plenty of Fish, OkCupid and our emerging brands like BLK, Chispa, and The League will be managed together for the first time. Hesam Hosseini will be taking on a newly created role as CEO of Evergreen & Emerging Brands. Formerly, the CEO of Match and Affinity brands, Hesam brings an unmatched level of experience to this combined global team. Combining our evergreen brands under a shared direction will enable us to streamline operations and reduce duplicative work. It will also allow us to leverage our institutional knowledge to drive growth with attractive margins across our emerging brands, where we see significant untapped potential. Lastly, we're excited to welcome Will Wu as our new CTO, who will work directly with all our brands to build upon Match Group's history of transformative innovation by continuing to incubate, launch and grow entirely new experiences for our users.Will and I have known each other for a long time, and he has had a highly influential impact on social media products, as we know them today. He has been able to build some of the most engaging user experiences for Millennials and Gen Z. And his passion and dedication will be a great fit for the culture at Match Group. I know the team here is going to welcome his expertise, creativity, work ethic and humility. And finally, through all of this, I would be remiss if I didn't take a moment to thank Gary. He has been instrumental in not only my onboarding, but has helped to lead with strength and clarity even amid a very challenging operating backdrop. As such, I'm pleased to appoint Gary as President and CFO of Match Group, a clear demonstration in the trust I have in him and the value we put in his ability to drive our shared vision forward.As we begin a new year, I'm energized and ready to take on this next chapter in Match Group's history. We are navigating the current macroeconomic challenges, and we have a strong team and clear vision to execute upon. I look forward to sharing more on our efforts in future calls. With that, I'll hand the call over to Gary.Photo by Damir Kopezhanov on UnsplashOur direct revenue was down 2% year-over-year. It grew 2% year-over-year in the Americas with growth at Tinder, Hinge, BLK and Chispa but declines at the Evergreen Brands, which include Match, Plenty of Fish and OkCupid. Direct revenue declined 4% year-over-year in Europe but was up 8% on an FX-neutral basis driven by Tinder and Hinge with weakness at Meetic. Direct revenue declined 9% year-over-year in APAC and Other, but was up 9% on an FX-neutral basis driven by Tinder. Total payers were 16.1 million, a decrease of 1% year-over-year. Payers were down 2% year-over-year in the Americas, down 4% in Europe and up 6% in APAC and Other. Tinder payers globally were up 3% year-over-year, while All Other Brands were down 8% in aggregate. Q4 RPP was down 1% year-over-year at $16.RPP was up 4% in the Americas driven primarily by higher average prices paid for subscriptions at Tinder and Hinge. RPP was up 1% year-over-year in Europe, where contributions from Tinder and Hinge were offset by the strength of the U.S. dollar compared to the euro and the British pound. RPP was down 14% year-over-year in APAC and Other due to the strength of the dollar relative to the yen and the Turkish lira. On an FX-neutral basis, Q4 RPP was up 7% year-over-year company-wide, up 14% in Europe and up 3% in APAC and Other. Tinder overall performed in line with our expectations in the quarter, delivering direct revenue of $444 million, flat year-over-year, up 8% on an FX-neutral basis. Tinder added just under 300,000 payers to just over 10.8 million.Tinder saw a 3% RPP decline year-over-year in the quarter, which again highlights the impact of FX. Tinder RPP was up 5% year-over-year on an FX-neutral basis. All Other Brands' direct revenue was down 5% year-over-year in Q4 driven by an 8% payer decline, partially offset by 3% RPP growth. Hinge, BLK and Chispa continue to drive growth with Hinge up nearly 30% year-over-year. Our Evergreen & Emerging Brands declined 9% year-over-year in terms of direct revenue, and our Asian brands saw direct revenue declined 16% year-over-year, in large part due to FX. We saw stability in Pairs and Hyperconnect direct revenue on a local currency basis, but we have yet to see a rebound in the Japanese market despite improvement in the COVID situation there.Indirect revenue was $15 million in the quarter, down 18% year-over-year, but similar in dollar terms to the other quarters of 2022. Q4 2021 was particularly strong for indirect revenue. Operating income was $107 million in Q4, a 54% year-over-year decrease for a margin of 14%. Operating income was impacted by $102 million in impairment charges on intangibles primarily related to our Meetic and Hyperconnect businesses. The charges stem from declining financial performance at Meetic as well as the use of higher discount rates on Hyperconnect's long-range forecasts due to the higher interest rate environment and higher market volatility overall. Our Hyperconnect business outlook did not change meaningfully during the quarter. Adjusted operating income was $286 million, down 2% year-over-year, representing a margin of 36%.Q4 AOI and margin strength reflected our nimbleness on costs, as we reduced marketing spend and rationalized some bonus and overhead costs. Excluding the impact of the $102 million of impairment charges, overall expenses, including SBC expense, were essentially flat year-over-year in Q4. Cost of revenue grew 1% year-over-year and represented 30% of total revenue, up 1 point year-over-year driven by App Store fees and hosting costs. Selling and marketing spend decreased $12 million or 9% year-over-year, the third consecutive quarter where we've seen a year-over-year reduction as we continue to reduce marketing spend at our lower-growth brands and to exercise ROI discipline overall. Selling and marketing spend was down 1 point year-over-year as a percentage of total revenue to 16%.G&A expense was flat year-over-year and steady at 14% of revenue, reflecting lower legal fees but higher compensation expense. Product development costs grew 21% year-over-year and were 10% of revenue primarily reflecting increased engineering headcount at Tinder and Hinge. Our gross leverage was 3.4x trailing adjusted operating income, and net leverage was 2.9x at the end of Q4. We ended the quarter with $581 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand. We did not repurchase any shares in the quarter as we decide to allow our cash balance to build slightly. And we are concerned by the high volatility and weakness in the equity markets generally in Q4, which drove ours and many other stock prices down throughout the quarter.With our cash balance now strong, we will reconsider repurchases once the window reopens. We currently have 5.3 million shares remaining under our buyback authorization. When we look at our history as a public company, 2022 stands out as a year we did not hit our growth targets, delivering 7% top line and 6% AOI growth, respectively. Some of the miss was due to macro factors, including consumer weakness and particularly FX. On an FX-neutral basis, our top line growth was 14% in 2022. But our business overall and Tinder, in particular, decelerated as the year went on. And product execution was not where we expected to be, especially in the first half of the year. For the full year 2022, Tinder direct revenue was approximately $1.8 billion. Hinge delivered $284 million in direct revenue, slightly below our $300 million expectation due primarily to our decision to delay the rollout of HingeX.Evergreen & Emerging had $730 million in direct revenue, and our Asia brands delivered $322 million in direct revenue. Fortunately, we made critical corrective changes in the middle of the year, which have begun delivering results. It's still very early, and it will require some patience through 2023 to see the momentum build, but we're increasingly confident we're on course to deliver results consistent with our standards. For Q1 '23, we expect total revenue for Match Group of $790 million to $800 million, roughly flat year-over-year. For Tinder, we expect direct revenue to increase slightly year-over-year. We expect Hinge to deliver Q1 year-over-year direct revenue growth of over 25% driven by continued strong performance in its core English-speaking markets, the introduction of the two new pricing tiers and continued European expansion.The early testing of the new Hinge tiers is going well with take rate consistent with our expectations, higher conversion impact than we expected and no notable cannibalization of Ã  la carte revenue. We expect the tiers to be globally rolled out by the end of February. We expect our Evergreen & Emerging Brands' direct revenue to be down under 10% year-over-year in aggregate, and our Asian brands to decline just under 15% driven in large part by FX. We expect Q1 indirect revenue to be down close to 10% year-over-year, given ad budgets broadly are being slashed due to macroeconomic concerns. We expect adjusted operating income of $250 million to $255 million in Q1, representing margin of about 32% at the midpoint of the ranges. IAP fees continue to be a headwind and will also now include an $8 million payment into the Google litigation escrow, which was a cost we didn't incur last Q1.We expect marketing spend to be up year-over-year at Tinder and Hinge with reductions elsewhere in the portfolio. We expect to incur $3 million to $5 million of severance and similar costs in Q1 related to our personnel reductions and cost savings initiatives. Macroeconomic factors are impacting our business, consistent with our expectations thus far in early 2023. That, coupled with improved product execution at our Tinder brand, gives us increasing confidence that Match Group can deliver 5% to 10% year-over-year revenue growth in 2023. We believe Tinder is positioned to deliver a similar range of growth. We also remain confident that Hinge's momentum will lead it to delivering nearly $400 million of direct revenue in 2023, approximately $100 million more than in 2022.We expect the company overall as well as Tinder to have accelerating year-over-year revenue growth as we move through 2023 driven by improved product execution leading to improved revenue momentum at Tinder. In terms of AOI, we expect improving year-over-year margins in the back half of the year as the benefits of our cost savings initiatives take hold and Tinder top line growth accelerates. Our cost savings initiatives are focused on rightsizing headcount and reducing overhead costs, including office expenses and professional fees. We expect to reduce our global workforce by approximately 8% in aggregate. We've already reduced roles in the U.S. In other countries, this process is ongoing. We expect to incur $6 million of severance and similar costs related to our cost savings initiatives in 2023.We're also reallocating marketing spend from lower-growth businesses to higher-growth ones in 2023 to keep overall spend close to flat. Our financial outlook reflects no change to current App Store policies, though we believe that the stores are moving to comply with aspects of the Digital Markets Act that is now in effect in Europe. The stores are also facing continued legal setbacks and restrictions in other markets globally such as India. We continue to expect changes in the App Store ecosystem, but the timing and shape of the changes is challenging to predict. We expect to be a U.S. Federal cash taxpayer in 2023. The precise amount we will pay depends in part on our stock price, which affects the compensation expense deductions we can take.We currently expect to convert low 70s percent of our AOI into free cash flow in 2023. We expect 2023 SBC expense of $230 million to $250 million, with the year-over-year increase driven by previous hiring as well as our desire to remain competitive on compensation. We've made a lot of critical changes since BK arrived mid last year, including revamping the Tinder team, streamlining our organizational structure, implementing cost savings initiatives and hiring critical new talent. These changes are just beginning to pay dividends. We expect it to take a little time in the first half of 2023 to build momentum but are confident that improved product momentum and our financial discipline position us for much stronger growth and profitability in the back half of the year as well as longer term.We look forward to delivering a combination of strong growth, profitability and cash flow generation for our shareholders. With that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions.","February 2, 2023 at 1:43 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/match-group-inc-nasdaq-mtch-194358376.html,Insider Monkey,0.0,0.0,0.10790863928268526,0.3895200230219316

MTCH,"At US$51.41, Is It Time To Put Match Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:MTCH) On Your Watch List?"," Check out our latest analysis for Match Group Match Group is currently expensive based on my price multiple model, where I look at the company's price-to-earnings ratio in comparison to the industry average. I’ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there’s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock’s ratio of 39.43x is currently well-above the industry average of 31.95x, meaning that it is trading at a more expensive price relative to its peers. But, is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Given that Match Group’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.Future outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Match Group's earnings over the next few years are expected to double, indicating a very optimistic future ahead.

MTCH,UPDATE 3-Tinder owner to lay off 8% of its staff as growth falters,"(Adds comment from Match Group and background, updates shares)By Vansh Agarwal and Shreyaa NarayananFeb 1 (Reuters) - Match Group Inc on Wednesday joined a growing list of U.S. companies that are cutting jobs to rein in costs after it announced plans to lay off about 8% of its workforce, or about 200 employees, as spending on its dating apps slows.The company gave a lackluster quarterly revenue forecast a day earlier that it blamed on a tough economy, a strong dollar and ""significant"" poor product execution at Tinder. Product delays have also hit its Hinge app at a time when competition is rising from rival Bumble Inc.The job cuts were mainly in areas such as recruiting, the company said in an email. The cuts have already taken place in the United States and are being implemented in other countries.Match incurred about $3 million in severance and similar costs during the fourth quarter and said it was expecting additional costs of about $6 million in 2023. It said the moves would help improve margins in the second half of the year.Shares of Texas-based Match were down 7.7%.The layoffs come as other tech firms from Microsoft Corp to Amazon.com Inc shed tens of thousands of jobs to brace for a possible recession.""In addition to the cuts, we expect Match to place greater emphasis on marketing its Tinder and Hinge brands, core areas of growth for 2023,"" CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino said.Match, which has primarily relied on word-of-mouth advertising, said Tinder will be launching its first global marketing campaign in the current quarter to improve brand perception.It forecast first-quarter revenue between $790 million and $800 million, lower than analysts' estimates of $817.3 million, according to Refinitiv data.

MTCH,Match Readies Headcount and Cost Cuts as Sales Set to Disappoint,"(Bloomberg) -- Match Group Inc. will reduce its global workforce 8% after the dating-app company provided first-quarter revenue guidance that fell short of analysts’ estimates and looks to cut costs.Most Read from BloombergStrongest Quake in Decades Kills Hundreds in Turkey, SyriaChina Moves From Contrite to Confrontational Over US BalloonUS Moves to Recover Chinese Balloon While Weighing RetaliationUS Downs Chinese Balloon, Prompting Protests from BeijingTrump Offers $1 Million Bond to Appeal Clinton Suit SanctionsThe job cuts have already been made in the US, and are ongoing in other countries, Chief Financial Officer Gary Swidler said on a call Wednesday. Shares of Match declined 5.1% as of 10:20 a.m. in New York.The Dallas-based company said Tuesday it expects total revenue of $790 million to $800 million in the first three months of 2023, missing analyst estimates for $816 million. About 200 people globally will be affected by the headcount reduction, many in roles such as recruiting, according to the company. Hiring will still continue at Hinge and other “key investment areas.”The company is reviewing how to pare spending on areas like jobs, marketing and office space, and expects to incur about $6 million of severance and similar expenses, it said in a statement Tuesday. It’s also preparing to shift savings from lower-growth brands into higher-growth businesses. Match says the move will produce an improvement in margins in the second half of the year as revenue growth accelerates.“We expect it to take a little time in the first half of 2023 to build momentum, but are confident that improved product momentum and and our financial discipline position us for much stronger growth and profitability in the back half of the year as well as longer term,” Swidler said on the call.The disappointing outlook caps a difficult year for the owner of dating apps like Tinder, Hinge and OkCupid. In 2022 the company changed chief executive officers, was hampered by a strong dollar weighing on overseas sales and dealt with a hangover from Covid-19 restrictions. Those factors sent its shares plummeting almost 70% last year, making it the second-worst performer in the S&P 500.The final three months of the year were tough. Fourth-quarter sales fell 2.5% to $786 million while the number of paying customers dropped 1% to 16.1 million in the period.Former CEO Shar Dubey stepped down from her role last May and former Zynga Inc. president Bernard Kim became her successor. In the months since Kim took on the new role, Match has started experimenting with new forms of monetization including a more expensive version of Hinge and its flagship product Tinder.Hinge has been one of the bright points for the company and has seen success in markets such as Germany and Sweden. The company said previously it expects the international expansion and new paid tier to bring in at least $100 million of direct revenue for Hinge in 2023.(Includes details on layoffs in the third paragraph, updates shares)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekChatGPT Gets an MBAA Billionaire’s Son Battles a Turbulent WWE Over the Future of Pro WrestlingWhen Hackers Hobbled Ireland’s Hospitals, They Took Themselves Down, TooA Portuguese Manufacturer Aims to Unseat Asia in $5,000 BikesDrugstore Chains Are Anti-Abortion Groups’ Latest Target©2023 Bloomberg L.P.","February 1, 2023 at 9:25 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/match-readies-headcount-cost-cuts-224553771.html,Bloomberg,0.0,0.0,0.01874271561771562,0.3507235819735819

MTCH,5 big earnings reports: Snap stock battered on sales warning,"By Davit KirakosyanBut the company said 2022 was a challenging year, as it continued to experience the impact of macroeconomic headwinds, platform policy changes, and increased competition, and expects the operating environment to remain challenging, as it sees these headwinds persist throughout Q1.Given uncertainties related to the operating environment, the company didn’t provide expectations for revenue or adjusted EBITDA for Q1. The company shared its internal forecast which assumes revenue to decline 2%-10% year-over-year in Q1, noting that it had observed a year-over-year decline in revenue of approximately 7% quarter-to-date.Following the results and guidance, UBS downgraded Snap to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $10.00. Its price target was lowered at several brokerages, including at Goldman Sachs (to $8 from $10), Barclays (to $15 from $18), and Credit Suisse (to $13 from $16), as well as Truist Securities (to $8.00 from $10.00) and Evercore ISI (to $12.00 from $14.00).Shares were recently changing hands at $9.82 premarket.Vodafone's (LON:VOD) interim CEO Margherita Della Valle pledged to improve results after Q3 revenue growth slowed due to weak performance in key European markets.Service revenue organic growth dropped to 1.8% year-over-year to €9.52B, due to declines in customer levels in Germany and price competition in Italy and Spain. However, the UK saw an increase in service figures by 5.3% on an annualized basis to €1.8B due to resilient demand and price hikes. This led to a quarterly total organic group revenue growth decrease to 2.7% from 4.1% in the previous quarter.Vodafone ADRs (NASDAQ:VOD) were trading more than 3% lower premarket today.Revenue grew 16% year-over-year to $5.6B, compared to the consensus of $5.52B, driven primarily by growth across its embedded and data center businesses and partially offset by lower revenue from chips for laptops, PCs, and gaming systems.For Q1/23, the company expects revenue in the range of $5B-5.6B, compared to the consensus of $5.48B.Following the results announcement, several Wall Street analysts raised their price targets on the stock, including KeyBanc with a new price target of $95.00 (from $80.00), JPMorgan with a new price target of $82.00 (from $70.00), and Morgan Stanley with a new price target of $87.00 (from $77.00).Goldman Sachs said it remains constructive on the stock given its expectation for significant market share expansion in server CPU and the potential for margin improvement in H2/23 and 2024 driven by higher volumes and better mix vs. H1/23, while noting that the competitive landscape in PC and the near-term correction in Data Center will potentially weigh on investor sentiment.For Q1/23, the company expects revenue to be in the range of $790M-$800M, worse than the consensus of $816M. For full-year, the company reaffirmed its focus on delivering 5%-10% year-over-year growth, in both Match Group's total revenue and Tinder Direct revenue.For Q3/23, the company expects EPS in the range of ($1.70)-($1.40), compared to the consensus of ($0.30).The company also announced that Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO) had purchased $900M of its convertible preferred stock together with Elliott Investment Management at an initial conversion price of $47.75 per share. Both companies were granted board seats.Liz Moyer, Yasin Ebrahim, and Scott Kanowsky contributed to this report.***Related Articles5 big earnings reports: Snap stock battered on sales warningPayPal's rocky road ahead warrants more cost cuts, Wall Street saysFutures dip on jitters ahead of ADP report, Fed decision","February 1, 2023 at 12:15 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-big-earnings-reports-snap-061548758.html,Investing.com,0.0,0.1,0.05603956228956229,0.4445917508417509

MTCH,Match Group (MTCH) Q4 Earnings and Revenues Lag Estimates,"Match Group (MTCH) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.30 per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.47 per share.

This compares to year-ago revenues of $806.07 million.

Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Match Group: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.47 on $815.57 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $2.15 on $3.45 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well.

Over the last three months, though, we're still looking at gains of just about 25%.Let's take a look at EA, Electronic Arts, here, off also just about 7 and 1/2% here in extended trading. Current quarter and full-year net booking guidance coming up short. That, of course, is a big focal point here for the Street, for investors when they're digging through this report here from EA.Also, another piece of bad news here. The new ""Star Wars"" game has been delayed to April, was initially expected to launch in March. We're looking at pressure on that stock here. Over the last three months, it didn't stray too far from the flat line, up just about 2%.And rounding it out with Amgen, that stock off just a fraction here in extended trading. EPS $4.09, beating by a penny. Revenue, though, ticking down to $6.84 billion. A 4% boost in product sales was offset by slowing sales of the manufacturing related to COVID-19. We're looking at losses of just about 6% in the last three months. Over the last six months, taking a look at a bit of a longer-term chart, that stock is actually in positive territory, up just about 2%.","January 31, 2023 at 3:59 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/stocks-moving-hours-amd-snap-215923143.html,Yahoo Finance Video,0.0,0.0,-0.04018620268620268,0.33716422466422463

MTCH,Tinder gets swiped left as Match's forecast disappoints,"By Vansh Agarwal and Shreyaa Narayanan(Reuters) -Match Group Inc on Tuesday forecast first-quarter revenue below expectations after Tinder, the face of online dating, became a sore point in 2022 and drove the company's first ever quarterly decline.While a tough economy and a stronger dollar had also crimped its business, poor product execution at Tinder was the ""significant"" culprit, Match said. Dating app Hinge's business was also hit by product delays, among other headwinds.Shares of the Dallas, Texas-based firm fell nearly 11% in trading after the bell, with Match saying it will book charges of about $6 million in 2023, following cuts to marketing spend, headcount and real estate expenses in a cost-saving drive.The company, which has largely relied on word-of-mouth advertising so far, said Tinder will be launching its first global marketing campaign in the current quarter to improve brand perception.The move comes after analysts expressed concerns that its minimal advertising efforts for Tinder would suppress business as competition intensifies from the likes of Bumble Inc while growing fears of a recession deter lower-income users.""Price sensitivity is increasing given the current macro environment, and our experts think users' willingness to pay is beginning to hit a limit,"" said Third Bridge analyst Nicholas Cauley.Tinder's revenue per payer declined 2% in the quarter.Match reaffirmed its 2023 revenue growth forecast of 5% to 10%. It expects revenue growth to reach double digits by the fourth quarter on increasing momentum in the second half.The company forecast first-quarter revenue between $790 million and $800 million, lower than analysts' estimates of $817.3 million, according to Refinitiv data. It cited in-app purchase fees as a major year-over-year headwind.Revenue fell 2% to $786 million in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, also missing expectations of $787.3 million.Total payers fell 1% to 16.1 million.(Reporting by Shreyaa Narayanan and Vansh Agarwal; Editing by Devika Syamnath)","January 31, 2023 at 3:14 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tinder-owner-sees-revenue-below-211445168.html,Reuters,0.0,0.0,0.005995514147688057,0.3447204968944099

MTCH,Concerns Over Tinder's Prospects Despite Match's Multiple Catalysts Keeps Analyst At Sidelines,"Match Group does have multiple potential catalysts and valuation levels that are as attractive as they have been since 2019.Still, the analyst initiated coverage on the sidelines as Match currently has multiple new initiatives too early for him to understand.Hinge is the shining star at Match Group, with expansion and monetization growth still in earlier days.Tinder is undergoing a rebuild of sorts. The rebuild includes efforts to improve its branding and monetization as both have come under pressure with market share losses in time spent and users.The analyst believes it's unlikely MTCH shares work long-term without Tinder seeing improvements in trends.The analyst looks to see incremental progress on Tinder's rebuild and signs of improvements in payer conversions and propensity to spend.In November 2022, Match Group reported that its third-quarter revenue increased 1% year-over-year to $810 million, which beat average analyst estimates of $795.43 million. The company reported quarterly earnings of 44 cents per share, which beat average forecasts of 41 cents per share.DateFirmActionFromToMar 2022Deutsche BankInitiates Coverage OnBuyMar 2022BMO CapitalUpgradesMarket PerformOutperformFeb 2022BMO CapitalMaintainsMarket PerformView More Analyst Ratings for MTCHView the Latest Analyst Ratings© 2023 Benzinga.com.

MTCH,Analysts Estimate Amazon (AMZN) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for,"Amazon (AMZN) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 2, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis online retailer is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.15 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -89.2%.Revenues are expected to be $145.37 billion, up 5.8% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 3.05% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Amazon?For Amazon, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -5.10%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Amazon will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Amazon would post earnings of $0.22 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.20, delivering a surprise of -9.09%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Amazon doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerMatch Group (MTCH), another stock in the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $0.47 for the quarter ended December 2022. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of +197.9%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $787.87 million, down 2.3% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Match Group has been revised 1.2% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -7.04%.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Match Group will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Amazon.com, Inc.

YELP,"YELP's Q1 Loss Narrower Than Estimated, Revenues Rise YoY","Meanwhile, Yelp’s revenues increased 13% year over year to $312 million and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $306.2 million. The top line primarily reflected growth in advertising revenues.Yelp Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseYelp Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Yelp Inc. QuoteAdvertising revenues (95.2% of total revenues) climbed 13% year over year to $297.1 million. This upside can primarily be attributed to higher customer spending and an increase in Paying Advertising Locations in both Services and Restaurants, Retail & Other categories.Paying Advertising Locations reached 554,000, up 1.5% from the year-ago quarter and 1.7% from the previous quarter. Within key categories, Paying Advertising Locations for Services business as well as Restaurants, Retail & Other categories increased 7,000 and 2,000, respectively, from the fourth-quarter 2022 figures.Within Advertising, Services revenues grew 15% year over year to $183.5 million on approximately 25% growth in the Home Services category and an increase in Paying Advertising Locations.Transaction revenues were $4 million in the first quarter, up 12% year over year, driven by an increase in per-order transaction fee from Grubhub post renewal of partnership in March 2022. This was partially offset by lower food take-out and delivery order volumes, as several restaurants resumed and increased their dine-in operations.Other revenues jumped 15% to $12 million, driven by the strong adoption of its Yelp Fusion program introduced in 2020.Total costs and expenses flared up 13% year over year to $319 million, reflecting the company’s continued investments in its long-term growth initiatives.Yelp’s first-quarter adjusted EBITDA increased 12% year over year to $54 million. The adjusted EBITDA margin remained flat year over year at 17%.As of Mar 31, 2023, Yelp’s cash, cash equivalents and short-term marketable securities were $414.2 million without any debt.During first-quarter 2023, the company generated an operating cash flow of $74.2 million. Yelp repurchased shares worth $50 million during the reported quarter.For the second quarter of 2023, Yelp projects revenues between $320 million and $330 million.Management expects adjusted EBITDA in the $60-$70 million band for the second quarter.For full-year 2023, the company estimates revenues between $1.295 billion and $1.315 billion.

YELP,Yelp (YELP) Beats Q1 Earnings and Revenue Estimates,"Yelp (YELP) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.02 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $0.08 per share. This compares to loss of $0.01 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 125%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this online business reviews company would post earnings of $0.31 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.28, delivering a surprise of -9.68%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Yelp , which belongs to the Zacks Internet - Content industry, posted revenues of $312.44 million for the quarter ended March 2023, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.05%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $276.63 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Yelp shares have added about 1% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 6.5%.What's Next for Yelp?While Yelp has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Yelp: favorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.24 on $324.08 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $0.92 on $1.3 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well.

other income, net; depreciation and amortization; stock-based compensation expense; and, in certain periods, certain other income and expense items, such as impairment charges. We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by net revenue.Adjusted EBITDA, which is not prepared under any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles, has limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of Yelp’s financial results as reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (""GAAP""). In particular, Adjusted EBITDA should not be viewed as a substitute for, or superior to, net income (loss) prepared in accordance with GAAP as a measure of profitability or liquidity. Some of these limitations are:although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect all cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements;Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, Yelp's working capital needs;Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the impact of the recording or release of valuation allowances or tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to Yelp;Adjusted EBITDA does not consider the potentially dilutive impact of equity-based compensation;Adjusted EBITDA does not take into account any income or costs that management determines are not indicative of ongoing operating performance, such as impairment charges; andother companies, including those in Yelp’s industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure.Because of these limitations, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin alongside other financial performance measures, net income (loss) and Yelp’s other GAAP results.The following is a reconciliation of net loss to Adjusted EBITDA, as well as the calculation of net loss margin and Adjusted EBITDA margin, for each of the periods indicated (in thousands, except percentages; unaudited):Three Months EndedMarch 31,20232022Reconciliation of Net Loss to Adjusted EBITDA:Net loss$(1,178)$(915)Benefit from income taxes(197)(2,612)Other income, net(5,212)(929)Depreciation and amortization10,80511,490Stock-based compensation46,25741,0603,555—Adjusted EBITDA$54,030$48,094Net revenue$312,438$276,628Net loss margin—%—%Adjusted EBITDA margin17%17%Contacts","May 4, 2023 at 3:05 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/demand-yelp-advertising-products-drove-200500780.html,Business Wire,0.3416666666666667,0.5333333333333333,0.027524468285337847,0.33184053265575
YELP,Yelp is using AI to help users write reviews,"When writing a review on Yelp, users now see topics—like “Food,” “Service,” and “Ambiance”—above the draft post that help them keep track of what they’ve covered and remind them what they may want to address. Once a topic is covered, it turns green with a checkmark.Read moreWhole Foods has shut down a store in downtown San Francisco on safety concernsYour anxiety brings 4 distinct superpowersAmericans may have seen the last of big rent hikesFor now, this AI writing guidance is only available for restaurants, but the company plans to expand it to more categories such as services, beauty, and health. “We know that sometimes you may develop writer’s block when crafting reviews,” Yelp said in a press release.Yelp shows how AI is meant to “help more people to do less of the operational aspects of finding the information or trying to summarize it in their mind,” so they can focus on the discovery, said Akhil Kuduvalli Ramesh, the company’s VP of consumer product.Lately, the company has trained its AI models on its own data and third-party sources to roll out not just review assistance but also features that help people search more efficiently. Yelp users can now see results beyond their search location without having to adjust it manually, as well as relevant snippets highlighted from reviews under each listing. More specific reviews and nuanced searches could also mean more usage of Yelp, which needs to compete with Google search.For instance, when you search for “tennis courts,” in addition to a list of parks and sports facilities, you’ll see details like “There are tennis courts that you need to book in advance.”“[As] a product manager, personally, I wouldn’t want them to wonder,” he added. “I want the app to be as intuitive helpful and relevant as possible...and they should feel like it’s a seamless, intuitive experience that just helps them.”More from QuartzThe world’s biggest banknote printer said the demand for cash hit a two-decade lowWhat were the world's busiest airports in 2022?Click here to read the full article.","April 25, 2023 at 12:57 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/yelp-using-ai-help-users-175700757.html,Quartz,0.0,0.0,0.20501207729468596,0.4602053140096619

YELP,Returns Are Gaining Momentum At Yelp (NYSE:YELP),"Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Yelp:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities) Check out our latest analysis for Yelp We're pretty happy with how the ROCE has been trending at Yelp. The data shows that returns on capital have increased by 467% over the trailing five years. That's not bad because this tells for every dollar invested (capital employed), the company is increasing the amount earned from that dollar. Speaking of capital employed, the company is actually utilizing 27% less than it was five years ago, which can be indicative of a business that's improving its efficiency. Yelp may be selling some assets so it's worth investigating if the business has plans for future investments to increase returns further still.For the record though, there was a noticeable increase in the company's current liabilities over the period, so we would attribute some of the ROCE growth to that. Essentially the business now has suppliers or short-term creditors funding about 18% of its operations, which isn't ideal. It's worth keeping an eye on this because as the percentage of current liabilities to total assets increases, some aspects of risk also increase.In a nutshell, we're pleased to see that Yelp has been able to generate higher returns from less capital. And since the stock has fallen 31% over the last five years, there might be an opportunity here. So researching this company further and determining whether or not these trends will continue seems justified.","April 17, 2023 at 2:19 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/returns-gaining-momentum-yelp-nyse-191938147.html,Simply Wall St.,0.0,0.0,0.19666666666666668,0.49666666666666665

YELP,What Is Yelp Inc.'s (NYSE:YELP) Share Price Doing?," Check out our latest analysis for Yelp According to my price multiple model, where I compare the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average, the stock currently looks expensive. In this instance, I’ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock’s cash flows. I find that Yelp’s ratio of 57.51x is above its peer average of 22.73x, which suggests the stock is trading at a higher price compared to the Interactive Media and Services industry. But, is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since Yelp’s share price is quite volatile, this could mean it can sink lower (or rise even further) in the future, giving us another chance to invest. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.Future outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Yelp's earnings over the next few years are expected to double, indicating a very optimistic future ahead. This should lead to stronger cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.","March 22, 2023 at 5:27 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/yelp-inc-nyse-yelp-share-112721785.html,Simply Wall St.,0.0,0.0,0.10153225806451614,0.4057258064516129

For full year 2022, revenue grew by only 12%. This number is worse than the company expected, and is much worse than what many investors were expecting. Snap attributed this slow growth rate to a rapid decline in online advertising revenue, as well as unfavorable economic conditions. Additionally, the company is predicting that Q1 revenue growth will only range from 2% to 10%. Thus, this is a loss-producing company with little growth to show for its efforts. There are better options elsewhere.Source: Worawee Meepian / Shutterstock.comThus, Twitch’s problems are just one of many concerns Amazon investors are putting up with right now.

The company’s recent Q4 results did note an increase in profitability. However, I think that the structural changes made to the economy as a result of the pandemic make Yelp a social media stock to sell.Julia Magas is a writer who covers the latest trends in finance and technology.

YELP,Are Yelp Inc.'s (NYSE:YELP) Mixed Financials Driving The Negative Sentiment?,"Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. See our latest analysis for Yelp Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Yelp is:5.1% = US$36m ÷ US$710m (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).The 'return' is the yearly profit. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.05 in profit.We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.At first glance, Yelp's ROE doesn't look very promising. We then compared the company's ROE to the broader industry and were disappointed to see that the ROE is lower than the industry average of 8.4%. Therefore, it might not be wrong to say that the five year net income decline of 40% seen by Yelp was probably the result of it having a lower ROE. However, there could also be other factors causing the earnings to decline. For instance, the company has a very high payout ratio, or is faced with competitive pressures.That being said, we compared Yelp's performance with the industry and were concerned when we found that while the company has shrunk its earnings, the industry has grown its earnings at a rate of 16% in the same period.Yelp doesn't pay any dividend, meaning that the company is keeping all of its profits, which makes us wonder why it is retaining its earnings if it can't use them to grow its business. It looks like there might be some other reasons to explain the lack in that respect. For example, the business could be in decline.","February 25, 2023 at 7:53 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/yelp-inc-nyse-yelp-mixed-135308663.html,Simply Wall St.,-0.15,0.325,0.11796428571428573,0.46608333333333346

Additionally, compared to 2019, Yelp found an overall increase in the average number of applicants per job posting in 2022, most notably in roles across general and administrative (up 200%) and sales (up 25%). Yelp also saw a shortened hiring process for these respective roles, with the average time to hire reduced by six days in 2022 – a 23% decrease since 2019.Consumers Picked Up New Hobbies Amid Remote Work ShiftMethodologyShare of Search LocationsThis metric analyzes how the distribution of U.S. search locations (where searches happened) shifted in 2022 compared to 2019 (pre-pandemic). For each location, the count of unique devices used to do searches on Yelp at that location is normalized by the total number of devices across all locations. Yelp then calculated the percentage change in the share of search locations in 2022 compared to the share of search locations in 2019 (pre-pandemic). Yelp made an assumption that the level of tourism remains the same across locations.*U.S. cities: Yelp analyzed New York City by borough to gain a more granular understanding of how people were relocating within the larger city.Business openingsBusiness openings refer to new business pages on Yelp in a given timeframe. The business pages are added by either business representatives or Yelp users. Yelp calculated the percentage change in the count of new businesses listed on Yelp, comparing 2022 to 2019, for the same geographic locations, openings are adjusted year-over-year, meaning openings are measured relative to the same time period in the previous period for the same business categories and geographic locations. This adjustment aims to account for seasonality.Consumer InterestYelp measures consumer interest of a category by aggregating the count of select actions that users take to connect with businesses on Yelp, such as viewing business pages, sharing photos or posting reviews. To observe the shift of user attention, which is likely to correlate with their expenditure, the consumer interest of a category is normalized by the total consumer actions on Yelp. By comparing a category’s period-over-period change in the share of consumer interest across categories, we draw inferences about the change in demand for different industries.Yelp Employee DataWe analyzed various employee and candidate data from Jan. 1, 2019 through Dec. 31, 2022 to provide a high level overview of Yelp’s workforce distribution, engagement and sentiment in a remote environment. All global employees were included in the data sets, but contractors were not considered.Recruiting DataFor much of the recruiting/candidate data, 2020 was excluded due to the effects that the COVID-19 pandemic had on hiring. Time to hire is defined as the time between when a candidate submits an application and when they accept an offer.Employee Sentiment DataSeveral global Yelp employee experience surveys were also analyzed to provide employee and candidate sentiment data. This includes the company’s 2022 Distributed Work Survey, July 2022 Programs and Benefits Survey, and First 30 Days at Yelp survey. This data is also referred to as ""employee listening data"" throughout the report.About Yelp Inc.Contacts","February 21, 2023 at 5:00 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/yelp-remote-report-reveals-pandemic-110000690.html,Business Wire,-0.05,0.1,0.07716950849603915,0.396548355272845
YELP,Yelp Inc. (NYSE:YELP) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript,"In addition, we are subject to a number of risks that may significantly impact our business and financial results. Please refer to our SEC filings as well as our shareholder letter for a more detailed description of the risk factors that may affect our results. During our call today, we'll discuss adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin which are non-GAAP financial measures. These measures should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. In our shareholder letter released this afternoon and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP financial measures, as well as historical reconciliations of GAAP net income to both adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin.And with that, I will turn the call over to Jeremy.We achieved record paying advertising locations and average revenue per location for the year. In services, we succeeded in differentiating the product experience and increasing monetization and lead quality resulting in greater value to service growth. We believe Yelp gained market share in 2022 as advertising revenue from services businesses grew 14% year-over-year to a record $694 million. The home services category was particularly strong, with year-over-year growth of approximately 20%. Since 2019, revenue from this category has compounded at an annual growth rate of nearly 20%. Advertising revenue for Restaurants, Retail & Other businesses increased by 17% year-over-year to $441 million, driven by growth in paying advertising locations.We continue to deliver value to advertisers in these categories by enhancing our suite of ad products designed to deliver high intent clicks, both up and down in the funnel and on/off Yelp. On the consumer side of our business, traffic remained below pre-pandemic levels as the macro environment contributed to softer consumer demand. App unique devices of $33 million were flat compared to 2021. Despite this backdrop, we made early progress on the consumer focused initiative we announced at the beginning of 2022. We reduced friction from the rewriting process, which helped our trustworthy content grow by 21 million new reviews in 2022. This resulted in more than 265 million cumulative reviews as of December 31, up 9% from 2021. In addition, our early work with large language models suggest there are a number of near-term applications that we can leverage to enhance the consumer experience on Yelp.Photo by Campaign Creators on UnsplashWe deliver value to our advertisers through our sophisticated ad system. This best-in-class technology is able to respond dynamically to changes in supply and demand to efficiently match consumers with advertisers. While ad clicks for the year declined by 8% from 2021, a year that had benefited from reopening tailwind and elevated consumer spending, advertiser demand remained robust as we executed against our roadmap of ad system improvements and average CPC increased by 27% year-over-year. We also made progress on our initiative to drive sales through the most efficient channels. Self-serve and Multi-location channels each grew approximately 25% year-over-year to record levels in 2022. Together, these channels represented approximately 48% of advertising revenue in 2022, up four percentage points from 2021.Looking back over the last year, the Yelp team has made tremendous progress across all of our strategic initiatives. Our investments in product have not only delivered record revenue, but also strengthened Yelp's position as a leader in local with trusted content sophisticated ad time. As a result, we plan to expand upon each of our initiatives to drive profitable growth in 2023 and over the long-term by continuing to invest in, growing quality leads and monetization and services, driving sales through the most efficient channels, delivering more value to advertisers and enhancing the consumer experience. After a quarter, these initiatives aim to continue to differentiate Yelp from peers in bringing increased value to local consumers and advertisers.We believe that our consistent execution in these areas in 2022 has positioned Yelp better than ever to drive long-term profitable growth. With that, I'd like to turn it over to David.Our efforts to drive high-quality leads to service pros have clearly resonated with advertisers in these categories. Average revenue per location and services reached a record and increased for the 10th quarter in a row. Advertising revenue from Restaurants, Retail & Other businesses increased by 11% year-over-year to $116 million. As anticipated in our fourth quarter business outlook, advertiser demand was more muted in the 2022 holiday season than in prior years, particularly among Multi-location advertisers. This contributed to softer year-over-year growth in paying advertising locations in these categories. Turning to expenses. Since significantly decrease in our headcount in 2020, we have made prudent investments in our product-led strategy to drive profitable growth over the long-term.We have increased the size of our product development and Multi-location sales organizations, while holding local sales headcount relatively flat. As a result, we ended the year with a total headcount of approximately 4,800 people, representing an increase of 11% year-over-year, but still 18% below 2019, while full year net revenue increased by 16% and 18% over the same periods. We are pleased with this progress and currently plan to maintain approximately the same total headcount in 2023. We believe our sales channel mix shift, product-led strategy and reduced real estate footprint will be sources of leverage and margin improvement over the long-term. In addition, we are committed to reducing stock-based compensation as a percentage of revenue.In 2022, we decreased this percentage by approximately two percentage points and expect to drive an additional decrease of one percentage point in 2023. Looking ahead, we believe we can lower stock-based compensation to less than 8% of revenue by the end of 2025, driven by revenue growth as well as by continuing to optimize our location and compensation mix, particularly within product development. Returning capital to shareholders through share repurchases remains an important element of our overall capital allocation strategy. In 2022, we repurchased $200 million worth of shares at average purchase price of $32.28. At the end of the year, we had $282 million remaining on our existing repurchase authorization. We plan to continue repurchasing shares in 2023, subject to market and economic conditions.Turning to our outlook. As we enter 2023, we continue to believe in the significant long-term opportunities ahead and our team's ability to capture them. However, the macro environment remains challenging. We expect net revenue will be in the range of $300 million to $310 million for the first quarter, reflecting typical seasonality. For the full year, we expect net revenue to be in the range of $1.29 billion to $1.31 billion as our initiatives continue to drive growth against the backdrop of ongoing macro uncertainties. Turning to margin. We expect expenses to increase from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, reflecting our hiring efforts in 2022 as well as a seasonal increase in expense, primarily driven by payroll taxes. As a result, we anticipate first quarter adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $40 million to $50 million.For the full year, we expect expenses to increase modestly year-over-year as we maintain approximately the same total headcount compared to the end of 2022. As such, we anticipate adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $290 million to $310 million for the full year. We also currently expect our effective GAAP tax rate for 2023 to be in the range of 32% to 38%, largely due to the requirement to amortize certain research and development expenses under the 2017 U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. In closing, Yelp delivered one of the strongest revenue growth performances among our advertising and marketplace peers in 2022. Our broad-based local ad platform has proven its durability and our team has continued to execute against our initiatives driving excellent results.While the macro environment remains uncertain, we've built a strong foundation for the future and are confident in Yelp's path to deliver profitable growth along with shareholder value over the long-term. With that, operator, please open up the line for questions.","February 12, 2023 at 8:31 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/yelp-inc-nyse-yelp-q4-143133305.html,Insider Monkey,0.0,0.0,0.11501005938505934,0.43565802253302244
YELP,Are Investors Undervaluing Yelp Inc. (NYSE:YELP) By 47%?," See our latest analysis for Yelp We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$230.5mUS$261.0mUS$273.5mUS$283.4mUS$292.4mUS$300.7mUS$308.5mUS$316.1mUS$323.5mUS$330.8mGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x2Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 3.63%Est @ 3.17%Est @ 2.84%Est @ 2.61%Est @ 2.45%Est @ 2.33%Est @ 2.25% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.5% US$212US$222US$214US$205US$195US$184US$174US$165US$155US$146After calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 8.5%.The total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$4.2b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$31.8, the company appears quite undervalued at a 47% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.We would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Yelp as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.5%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.080. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.StrengthCurrently debt free.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.Trading below our estimate of fair value by more than 20%.ThreatAnnual revenue is forecast to grow slower than the American market.Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value?

Yelp is faring much better than others that are reliant on their ad businesses, both Meta and Google's Q4 revenue. That dropped about 4% year over year.And Allie, this really points to the fact that people are spending. And when they are spending, a lot of them are spending it on experiences. Yelp, obviously, a beneficiary there, just in terms of the traffic that they're seeing on their site. And they're able to still generate those ads.And if you're a mom and pop electrical contracting shop-- you're trying to make up for those pandemic losses-- you're trying to stay busy-- one way to do that is just run a bunch of ads on Yelp. So this makes sense to me. And another thing that I thought was interesting about Yelp is that last year, they increased their headcount by 500 people. They said this year, hiring will likely remain flat. But the fact that they're not leaning into layoffs and we've seen a lot of companies do that, it's just one way that they're able to weather that storm.","February 10, 2023 at 3:05 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/yelp-stock-rises-amid-q4-210529089.html,Yahoo Finance Video,0.0,0.0,0.16372053872053874,0.3887037037037037

YELP,"YELP's Q4 Earnings Fall Short of Expectations, Revenues Beat","The company reported earnings of 28 cents per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 31 cents. The bottom line dropped 6.7% from the year-ago quarter’s earnings of 30 cents per share.Meanwhile, Yelp’s revenues increased 13.1% year over year to $309.1 million and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $306.5 million. The top line primarily reflected growth in advertising revenues.Yelp Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Yelp Inc. QuoteAdvertising revenues (95.1% of total revenues) climbed 12% year over year to $294 million. This upside can primarily be attributed to higher customer spending and an increase in Paying Advertising Locations in both Services and Restaurants, Retail & Other categories.Paying Advertising Locations reached 545,000, up 3.2% from the year-ago quarter but down 4.7% from the previous quarter. Within key categories, Paying Advertising Locations for Services business as well as Restaurants, Retail & Other categories decreased 7,000 and 20,000, respectively, from third-quarter 2022 figures.Within Advertising, Services revenues grew 13.4% year over year to $178.3 million on growth in the Home, Local, Auto, Professional, Pets, Real Estate, Financial and Event Services categories.Transaction revenues were $3.3 million in the fourth quarter, up 15% year over year, driven by an increase in the per-order transaction fee from Grubhub post renewal of partnership in March 2022. This was partially offset by lower food take-out and delivery order volumes, as several restaurants resumed and increased their dine-in operations.Other revenues jumped 30% to $11.8 million, driven by the strong adoption of its Yelp Fusion program introduced in 2020 and lower COVID-19 relief incentives in the form of waived subscription fees.Total costs and expenses flared up 9% year over year to $276 million, reflecting the company’s continued investments in its long-term growth initiatives.Yelp’s fourth-quarter adjusted EBITDA increased 18.1% year over year to $80.4 million.

YELP,Yelp shares jump after review platform reports Q4 earnings beat,"By Scott KanowskyInvesting.com -- Yelp Inc (NYSE:YELP) shares spiked in early U.S. trading on Friday after resiliency in the crowdsourced review platform's advertising business helped it post better-than-expected top and bottom line results in the fourth quarter.On an annual basis, adjusted core income expanded by 10% year-on-year to $270M on net revenues of $1.2B, marking record levels. Both figures beat projections as well.The group said the returns were driven by strong demand from advertisers despite headwinds from price inflation and flagging customer expenditures, with home service providers in particular boosting sales. This trend was partly offset by a decrease in ad clicks, which Yelp said stemmed from a tough comparison to 2021, when spending boomed after the loosening of most COVID-era restrictions.“These results demonstrate the strength of our broad-based local advertising platform and the momentum across our strategic initiatives. In 2023, we plan to continue our disciplined investments to drive shareholder value over the long term,” said Chief Financial Officer David Schwarzbach in a statement.Yelp predicts that it will report revenue of between $300M to $310M and adjusted core profit of $40M to $50M in the current quarter. Analysts at Credit Suisse called the outlook ""conservative,"" adding that it is likely reflective of broader economic pressures and weaker seasonal demand.For the 2023 fiscal year, Yelp sees net revenue in the range of $1.29B to $1.31B and adjusted core earnings in the $290M to $310M band, largely in line with forecasts.Related ArticlesYelp shares jump after review platform reports Q4 earnings beatAuto parts maker Magna warns of margin pressures on higher costsJefferies bullish as they wait for updates at Goldman Sachs' investor day","February 10, 2023 at 3:55 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/yelp-shares-jump-review-platform-095551494.html,Investing.com,0.0,0.0,0.11325863678804854,0.3605042016806723

This compares to earnings of $0.30 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -9.68%.

Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Yelp: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) for the stock.

YELP,Yelps Product-Led Strategy Drove Strong 2022 Results,"2022 Net Revenue reached a new high of $1.2 billion2022 Net Income a positive $36 million2022 Adjusted EBITDA increased to a record $270 million""We delivered a number of record financial results in 2022 thanks to the strong execution of our teams on our product-led strategy,"" said Jeremy Stoppelman, Yelp’s co-founder and chief executive officer.

We also reached record levels in the number of business locations that advertise on Yelp and the average amount each location spends, signaling that our product investments are paying off. Looking ahead, we’re confident in our plan to drive profitable growth over the long term as we deliver on our mission to connect consumers with local businesses.""""Yelp’s strong performance in 2022 led to 16% year over year net revenue growth, reaching a record $1.2 billion,"" said David Schwarzbach, Yelp’s chief financial officer. ""These results demonstrate the strength of our broad-based local advertising platform and the momentum across our strategic initiatives. In 2023, we plan to continue our disciplined investments to drive shareholder value over the long term.""2022 Key Business HighlightsYelp’s product-led business model drove a number of record results in 2022, even as macro challenges persisted:Net revenue increased by 16% year over year to a record $1.2 billion, near the high end of Yelp’s outlook range provided in November 2022 and $14 million above the high end of the company’s initial outlook range provided in February 2022.Net income decreased by approximately $3 million year over year to positive $36 million.Adjusted EBITDA grew 10% year over year to a record $270 million, at the midpoint of Yelp’s outlook ranges provided in February and November 2022, representing a 23% adjusted EBITDA margin.Strong advertiser demand drove this record revenue performance across categories and channels. Total advertising revenue increased by 15% year over year to a record $1.1 billion, reflecting balanced growth in paying advertising locations and average revenue per location. Paying advertising locations for the year increased by 7% compared to 2021.In Services, Yelp demonstrated consistent year-over-year growth throughout 2022, resulting in a record $694 million of advertising revenue from Services businesses for the year. The company reported the 10th consecutive quarter of growth in average revenue per location in these categories. Advertiser demand was particularly robust in the Home Services category, where annual revenue increased by approximately 20% year over year and at a compound annual growth rate of nearly 20% from 2019.Advertising revenue from Restaurants, Retail & Other businesses increased by 17% year over year to $441 million, primarily driven by growth in paying advertising locations.Advertising revenue from each of Yelp’s most efficient channels, Self-serve and Multi-location, grew by approximately 25% year over year in 2022.Ad clicks for the year decreased by 8% from 2021, a year that benefited from reopening tailwinds and elevated consumer spending. Average CPC for the year increased by 27% as advertiser demand for Yelp’s valuable, high-intent clicks was robust, demonstrated by records in both paying advertising locations and average revenue per location for the year.On the consumer side of Yelp’s business, demand remained below pre-pandemic levels as consumers visited many types of businesses less frequently. In 2022, app unique devices were flat compared to 2021. The company also reported an increase in average review submission frequency among users, who contributed 21 million new reviews in 2022, up 3% from the prior year. This resulted in more than 265 million cumulative reviews as of December 31, up 9% year over year.OutlookThe company expects 2023 Net revenue will be in the range of $1.29 billion to $1.31 billion as it continues executing on its strategic initiatives. The company also expects Adjusted EBITDA will be in the range of $290 million to $310 million.Quarterly Conference CallAbout YelpYelp intends to make future announcements of material financial and other information through its Investor Relations website. Yelp will also, from time to time, disclose this information through press releases, filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, conference calls, or webcasts, as required by applicable law.Forward Looking StatementsThis press release contains forward-looking statements relating to, among other things, Yelp’s future performance and its investment plans, including the ability of its investments and initiatives to drive profitable long-term growth and shareholder value, that are based on its current expectations, forecasts, and assumptions that involve risks and uncertainties.Yelp’s actual results could differ materially from those predicted or implied and reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance.

andYelp’s ability to generate and maintain sufficient high-quality content from its users.YELP INC.CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS(In thousands)(Unaudited)AssetsCurrent assets:Cash and cash equivalents$306,379$479,783Short-term marketable securities94,244—Accounts receivable, net131,902107,358Prepaid expenses and other current assets63,46757,536Total current assets595,992644,677Property, equipment and software, net77,22483,857Operating lease right-of-use assets97,392140,785Goodwill102,328105,128Intangibles, net8,99710,673Other non-current assets133,98965,408Total assets$1,015,922$1,050,528Liabilities and Stockholders’ EquityCurrent liabilities:Accounts payable and accrued liabilities$137,950$119,620Operating lease liabilities — current39,67440,237Deferred revenue5,2004,156Total current liabilities182,824164,013Operating lease liabilities — long-term86,661127,979Other long-term liabilities36,1137,218Total liabilities305,598299,210Stockholders’ equity:Common stock——Additional paid-in capital1,649,6921,522,572Accumulated other comprehensive loss(15,545)(11,090)Accumulated deficit(923,823)(760,164)Total stockholders’ equity710,324751,318Total liabilities and stockholders’ equity$1,015,922$1,050,528YELP INC.CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS(In thousands, except per share data)(Unaudited)2022202120222021Net revenue$309,103$273,400$1,193,506$1,031,839Costs and expenses:28,48324,045105,70578,097126,357113,379514,927454,22472,22570,384305,561276,47337,96728,859164,108135,816Depreciation and amortization10,68717,14044,85255,683Restructuring———32Total costs and expenses275,719253,8071,135,1531,000,325Income from operations33,38419,59358,35331,514Other income, net3,4786268,4252,204Income before income taxes36,86220,21966,77833,718Provision for (benefit from) income taxes16,717(2,971)30,431(5,953)Net income attributable to common stockholders$20,145$23,190$36,347$39,671Net income per share attributable to common stockholdersBasic$0.29$0.32$0.51$0.53Diluted$0.28$0.30$0.50$0.50Weighted-average shares used to compute net income per share attributable to common stockholdersBasic70,00172,95570,86774,221Diluted71,60776,05473,40278,6162022202120222021Cost of revenue$1,060$1,029$4,761$4,302Sales and marketing8,1607,70333,62132,335Product development20,09019,81786,87181,624General and administrative7,0276,58430,83733,418Total stock-based compensation$36,337$35,133$156,090$151,679YELP INC.CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS(In thousands)(Unaudited)Year Ended December 31,20222021Operating ActivitiesNet income$36,347$39,671Adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities:Depreciation and amortization44,85255,683Provision for doubtful accounts25,00614,574Stock-based compensation156,090151,679Noncash lease cost32,81039,339Deferred income taxes(56,621)(9,190)Amortization of deferred contract cost18,82714,613Asset impairment10,46411,164Noncash gain on lease termination—(11,485)Other adjustments, net1,036392Changes in operating assets and liabilities:Accounts receivable(49,555)(33,535)Prepaid expenses and other assets(36,032)(49,246)Operating lease liabilities(40,057)(41,008)Accounts payable, accrued liabilities and other liabilities49,14230,004Net cash provided by operating activities192,309212,655Investing ActivitiesPurchases of marketable securities — available-for-sale(127,080)—Sales and maturities of marketable securities — available-for-sale32,821—Purchases of property, equipment and software(31,979)(28,282)Other investing activities94632Net cash used in investing activities(126,144)(27,650)Financing ActivitiesProceeds from issuance of common stock for employee stock-based plans23,49724,984Taxes paid related to the net share settlement of equity awards(61,023)(62,545)Repurchases of common stock(200,006)(262,928)Net cash used in financing activities(237,532)(300,489)Effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash(2,136)(415)Change in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash(173,503)(115,899)Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash — Beginning of period480,641596,540Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash — End of period$307,138$480,641Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresThis press release and statements made during the above referenced webcast may include information relating to Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin, each of which the Securities and Exchange Commission has defined as a ""non-GAAP financial measure.""We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss), adjusted to exclude: provision for (benefit from) income taxes; other income, net; depreciation and amortization; stock-based compensation expense; and, in certain periods, certain other income and expense items, such as restructuring costs, impairment charges and net gain on lease termination. We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by net revenue.Adjusted EBITDA, which is not prepared under any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles, has limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of Yelp’s financial results as reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (""GAAP""). In particular, Adjusted EBITDA should not be viewed as a substitute for, or superior to, net income (loss) prepared in accordance with GAAP as a measure of profitability or liquidity. Some of these limitations are:although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect all cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements;Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, Yelp's working capital needs;Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the impact of the recording or release of valuation allowances or tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to Yelp;Adjusted EBITDA does not consider the potentially dilutive impact of equity-based compensation;Adjusted EBITDA does not take into account any income or costs that management determines are not indicative of ongoing operating performance, such as restructuring costs, impairment charges and net gain on lease termination; andother companies, including those in Yelp’s industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure.Because of these limitations, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin alongside other financial performance measures, net income (loss) and Yelp’s other GAAP results.The following is a reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA, as well as the calculation of net income margin and Adjusted EBITDA margin, for each of the periods indicated (in thousands, except percentages; unaudited):2022202120222021Reconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA:Net income$20,145$23,190$36,347$39,671Provision for (benefit from) income taxes16,717(2,971)30,431(5,953)Other income, net(3,478)(626)(8,425)(2,204)Depreciation and amortization10,68717,14044,85255,683Stock-based compensation36,33735,133156,090151,679Restructuring———32——10,46411,164—(3,748)—(3,748)Adjusted EBITDA$80,408$68,118$269,759$246,324Net revenue$309,103$273,400$1,193,506$1,031,839Net income margin7%8%3%4%Adjusted EBITDA margin26%25%23%24%(1)Recorded within general and administrative expenses on our condensed consolidated statements of operations.ContactsInvestor Relations Contact:Press Contact:","February 9, 2023 at 3:05 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/yelp-product-led-strategy-drove-210500831.html,Business Wire,0.4333333333333333,0.7333333333333333,0.016430938852813867,0.35074049648268385
YELP,Yelp Revenue Tops Estimates Despite Softer Ad Market,The local service recommendation site Yelp benefitted in the fourth quarter from increased spending by home-service providers.,"February 10, 2023 at 7:24 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/m/69bebb74-7359-3ea2-bbae-7a33347e6e85/yelp-revenue-tops-estimates.html,Barrons.com,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
YELP,Yelp (YELP) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Next Week's Release,"The market expects Yelp (YELP) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 9. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis online business reviews company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.31 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +3.3%.Revenues are expected to be $306.53 million, up 12.1% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 18.18% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Yelp?For Yelp, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +12.75%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Yelp will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Yelp would post earnings of $0.12 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.13, delivering a surprise of +8.33%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Yelp doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Yelp Inc.

YELP,Strength Seen in Genius Sports Limited (GENI): Can Its 5.6% Jump Turn into More Strength?,"Genius Sports Limited (GENI) shares rallied 5.6% in the last trading session to close at $5.43. This move can be attributable to notable volume with a higher number of shares being traded than in a typical session. This compares to the stock's 63.7% gain over the past four weeks.Genius Sports extended its rally, driven by its strength in betting technology, Second Spectrum and programmatic advertising services. Further, solid momentum in broadcasting ecosystem, growing strategic partnerships and increasing customer wins are aiding the company in gaining investors’ optimism.This company is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.11 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +75%. Revenues are expected to be $105.45 million, up 25.5% from the year-ago quarter.Earnings and revenue growth expectations certainly give a good sense of the potential strength in a stock, but empirical research shows that trends in earnings estimate revisions are strongly correlated with near-term stock price movements.For Genius Sports Limited, the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. And a stock's price usually doesn't keep moving higher in the absence of any trend in earnings estimate revisions. So, make sure to keep an eye on GENI going forward to see if this recent jump can turn into more strength down the road.The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

YELP,"Twitter, Meta Back Google in Key Supreme Court Case","(Bloomberg) -- Meta Platforms Inc., Microsoft Corp., Twitter Inc. and other tech firms came to Google’s defense in a flurry of legal briefs filed Thursday in a Supreme Court case that could fundamentally change the way the internet works.Most Read from BloombergHindenburg’s Short Sell Call Shaves $12 Billion Off Adani StocksUS Confronts China Over Companies’ Ties to Russia War EffortJosh Kushner Is Richer Than Trump After Billionaires Back His FirmTech-Led Slide Fades; Tesla Whipsaws on Earnings: Markets WrapUS and Germany Set to Send Tanks to Ukraine, Breaking DeadlockThe tech companies are urging the Supreme Court justices to carefully approach Gonzalez v. Google, a case centered around whether online firms should be held liable for content they recommend to users.A 1996 statute known as Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act currently protects companies from facing lawsuits over posts from their users, including comments, reviews, advertisements and more. The court is considering whether it’s time to narrow that statute, which was written before the internet became a central part of daily life.But the companies — even Microsoft and Yelp Inc., typically Google’s rivals — say narrowing the online speech liability shield could destroy their ability to serve up relevant recommendations to users. Reddit Inc. and Craigslist Inc. also joined in support.A court decision undermining the statute could “strip these digital publishing decisions of long-standing, critical protection from suit — and it would do so in illogical ways that are inconsistent with how algorithms actually work,” Microsoft said in the filing.The plaintiffs — the family of an American woman killed in a 2015 terrorist attack by ISIS — claim that Alphabet Inc.’s Google, which owns YouTube, bears responsibility for the automated process that recommends videos, such as those that could contribute to radicalization.The court is scheduled to hear oral arguments in the case on Feb. 21.A number of children’s online safety advocates, such as Fairplay and Common Sense Media, backed the Gonzalez family in the case, arguing that the tech companies should face repercussions for the ways their products can harm children. And the US government partially sided with Gonzalez, arguing that in some cases social media companies should be held liable for promoting harmful speech.The companies focused the bulk of their filings on warnings about how a ruling could harm their products.Meta, operator of Facebook, said the case would force online companies to remove far more content than they do now. The company said changing Section 230 “would incentivize online services to remove important, provocative, and controversial content on issues of public concern, frustrating what Congress intended to be a vibrant marketplace of diverse perspectives.”Microsoft said its search engine Bing and online forum LinkedIn could face “devastating and destabilizing effects from a broad ruling that changes Section 230.”In a statement, Microsoft said any modifications of Section 230 are better left to Congress to decide.Twitter said recommendation algorithms help organize the internet’s reams of information and make the web usable and easy to understand for users.“Section 230 ensures that websites like Twitter and YouTube can function notwithstanding the unfathomably large amounts of information they make available and the potential liability that could result from doing so,” Twitter said in its filing. The company added that it “would take an average user approximately 181 million years to download all data from the web today.”Yelp in its filing noted that it “does not often align itself with Google,” but on this issue, “the potential consequences for consumers and online platforms are significant.” Yelp said it would struggle to provide useful reviews and recommendations to users without Section 230.A number of tech company trade groups, and some smaller firms including Ziprecruiter Inc. and Indeed Inc., filed comments about the importance of Section 230 to their business models.Separately, the court on Friday will consider whether to take up two more cases related to Section 230. The cases challenge new laws in Texas and Florida that would punish tech companies for removing political speech from their platforms.--With assistance from Greg Stohr.(Updates with Meta filing in 10th paragraph)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekHow to Be 18 Years Old Again for Only $2 Million a YearWind Turbines Taller Than the Statue of Liberty Are Falling OverElon Musk’s Epic Quest for LOLs Is Only Hurting TeslaIs Europe Sleepwalking Into Another War?Is a US Recession Near?

YELP,"The five-year underlying earnings growth at Yelp (NYSE:YELP) is promising, but the shareholders are still in the red over that time","With the stock having lost 7.5% in the past week, it's worth taking a look at business performance and seeing if there's any red flags. See our latest analysis for Yelp While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).During the unfortunate half decade during which the share price slipped, Yelp actually saw its earnings per share (EPS) improve by 18% per year. So it doesn't seem like EPS is a great guide to understanding how the market is valuing the stock. Or possibly, the market was previously very optimistic, so the stock has disappointed, despite improving EPS.Due to the lack of correlation between the EPS growth and the falling share price, it's worth taking a look at other metrics to try to understand the share price movement.Revenue is actually up 4.2% over the time period. A more detailed examination of the revenue and earnings may or may not explain why the share price languishes; there could be an opportunity.You can see how earnings and revenue have changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on US exchanges.","December 11, 2022 at 7:54 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/five-underlying-earnings-growth-yelp-135441924.html,Simply Wall St.,0.1,0.25,0.06541666666666668,0.4179166666666666

YELP,Yelp (NYSE:YELP) Is Doing The Right Things To Multiply Its Share Price,"Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. The formula for this calculation on Yelp is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities) See our latest analysis for Yelp Yelp has not disappointed with their ROCE growth. More specifically, while the company has kept capital employed relatively flat over the last five years, the ROCE has climbed 186% in that same time. So our take on this is that the business has increased efficiencies to generate these higher returns, all the while not needing to make any additional investments. It's worth looking deeper into this though because while it's great that the business is more efficient, it might also mean that going forward the areas to invest internally for the organic growth are lacking.On a side note, we noticed that the improvement in ROCE appears to be partly fueled by an increase in current liabilities. The current liabilities has increased to 19% of total assets, so the business is now more funded by the likes of its suppliers or short-term creditors. It's worth keeping an eye on this because as the percentage of current liabilities to total assets increases, some aspects of risk also increase.To sum it up, Yelp is collecting higher returns from the same amount of capital, and that's impressive. Given the stock has declined 34% in the last five years, this could be a good investment if the valuation and other metrics are also appealing. So researching this company further and determining whether or not these trends will continue seems justified.","November 7, 2022 at 9:17 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/yelp-nyse-yelp-doing-things-151759917.html,Simply Wall St.,0.14285714285714285,0.26785714285714285,0.21330645161290324,0.45873655913978495
YELP,Implied Volatility Surging for Yelp (YELP) Stock Options,"Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Yelp shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Yelp is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Internet - Content industry that ranks in the Top 29% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, one analyst has increased the earnings estimate for the current quarter, while four have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 44 cents per share to 35 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Yelp right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

The top line primarily reflected growth in advertising revenues.Advertising revenues (95.1% of total revenues) climbed 14% year over year to $293.7 million. This upside can primarily be attributed to higher customer spending and an increase in Paying Advertising Locations in both Services and Restaurants, Retail & Other categories.Paying Advertising Locations reached 572,000, up 6.9% from the year-ago quarter and 0.5% from the previous quarter.

These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.A quarter ago, it was expected that this provider of websites and career fairs for professionals would post earnings of $0.01 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.01, delivering no surprise.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates just once.DHI Group , which belongs to the Zacks Internet - Content industry, posted revenues of $38.53 million for the quarter ended September 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.90%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $30.76 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.DHI Group shares have added about 3.4% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's decline of -19.1%.What's Next for DHI Group?While DHI Group has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for DHI Group: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.02 on $39.08 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $0.04 on $147.89 million in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Internet - Content is currently in the top 12% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.One other stock from the same industry, Yelp (YELP), is yet to report results for the quarter ended September 2022. The results are expected to be released on November 3.This online business reviews company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.12 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -47.8%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.Yelp's revenues are expected to be $306.12 million, up 13.7% from the year-ago quarter.","November 2, 2022 at 4:55 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dhi-group-dhx-matches-q3-225510091.html,Zacks,0.0,0.0,0.015243902439024383,0.46951219512195114

YELP,Analysts Estimate Yelp (YELP) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for,"Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when Yelp (YELP) reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 3. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis online business reviews company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.12 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -47.8%.Revenues are expected to be $306.12 million, up 13.7% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.81% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Yelp?For Yelp, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -6.38%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Yelp will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Yelp would post a loss of $0.02 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.11, delivering a surprise of +650%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Yelp doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAnother stock from the Zacks Internet - Content industry, Airbnb, Inc. (ABNB), is soon expected to post earnings of $1.45 per share for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +18.9%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $2.86 billion, up 27.6% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Airbnb, Inc. has been revised 2.6% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a higher Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 5.52%.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), suggests that Airbnb, Inc. will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.","October 27, 2022 at 9:02 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-estimate-yelp-yelp-report-140202231.html,Zacks,0.0,0.0,0.09438380768168009,0.4816688925731478

other income, net; depreciation and amortization; stock-based compensation expense; and, in certain periods, certain other income and expense items, such as restructuring costs and impairment charges. We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by net revenue.Adjusted EBITDA, which is not prepared under any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles, has limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of Yelp’s financial results as reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (""GAAP""). In particular, Adjusted EBITDA should not be viewed as a substitute for, or superior to, net income (loss) prepared in accordance with GAAP as a measure of profitability or liquidity. Some of these limitations are:although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect all cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements;Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, Yelp's working capital needs;Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the impact of the recording or release of valuation allowances or tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to Yelp;Adjusted EBITDA does not consider the potentially dilutive impact of equity-based compensation;Adjusted EBITDA does not take into account any income or costs that management determines are not indicative of ongoing operating performance, such as restructuring costs and impairment charges; andother companies, including those in Yelp’s industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure.Because of these limitations, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin alongside other financial performance measures, net income (loss) and Yelp’s other GAAP results.The following is a reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA, as well as the calculation of net income margin and Adjusted EBITDA margin, for each of the periods indicated (in thousands, except percentages; unaudited):Three Months EndedNine Months EndedSeptember 30,2022September 30,2021September 30,2022September 30,2021Reconciliation of Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA:Net income$9,108$18,065$16,202$16,481Provision for (benefit from) income taxes7,0073,91113,714(2,982)Other income, net(2,691)(331)(4,947)(1,578)Depreciation and amortization11,41712,62734,16538,543Stock-based compensation38,63236,442119,753116,546Restructuring———3210,464—10,46411,164Adjusted EBITDA$73,937$70,714$189,351$178,206Net revenue$308,891$269,155$884,403$758,439Net income margin3%7%2%2%Adjusted EBITDA margin24%26%21%23%Contacts","November 3, 2022 at 2:05 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/yelp-reports-record-net-revenue-200500526.html,Business Wire,0.0,0.0,0.013972234661889835,0.32476240234860926

YELP,"Q3 Yelp Economic Average Finds that Consumers Inflationary Experiences Intensify Across the U.S., as People Increasingly Turn to Budget Options","Regionally, inflation hit the Southwest the hardest in the past quarter; food businesses and restaurants drove increases of inflationary experiences nationwide in the past yearInflationary experiences on Yelp continue to increase in Q3 2022. (Graphic: Business Wire)Yelp found that food businesses are seeing one of the largest increases of inflationary experiences compared to Q3 2021, followed by restaurants, then businesses in the categories of beauty and spas, arts and entertainment, nightlife and bars, and hotels and travel. In response, consumer searches for budget-friendly dining and grocery options are higher than Q3 2021.""While U.S. inflation doesn't appear to be slowing down, Yelp's data shows consumers are increasingly looking for more affordable options to counter this uncertainty,"" said Pria Mudan, data science leader at Yelp. ""We continue to see increasing mentions of inflation for food businesses and restaurants, aligning with the recent Consumer Price Index report that found prices for food away from home was up 8.5% from 2022. It's clear consumers are mindful of their wallets with Yelp searches related to affordable groceries and fast food concepts noticeably up from last year.""Consumers increasingly feel the impact of inflation, especially in the Southwest this past quarterAs the annual inflation rate remains above market forecasts, only slightly decreasing to 8.2% in September 2022, consumers continue to show increased signs of inflation fatigue. Every U.S. state, as well as Washington D.C., saw an increase in inflation mentions in Yelp reviews compared to Q3 2021.Regionally, Yelp data shows that the Southwest is experiencing the highest quarter-over-quarter growth of inflation mentions – up 7% compared to Q2 2022. Meanwhile, the Midwest is experiencing the highest growth of inflation mentions year over year – up 26%.Food businesses saw one of the largest increases of inflationary experiences in the past year, followed by restaurants, beauty, arts and entertainment, and nightlifeConsumers report experiencing inflation the most at food businesses and restaurants, with inflation mentions in reviews up 31% and 28%, respectively, year over year. Of all Yelp restaurant categories that saw an increase in inflationary experiences, a quarter of them serve Asian cuisine, with a 24% average increase of inflation mentions from Q3 2021. Additionally, grocery stores and markets make up four of the top five food businesses with an increase in inflationary mentions in reviews compared to Q3 2021. Food businesses primarily selling desserts also saw a 29% average increase in inflation mentions compared to Q3 2021.When compared to Q3 2021, the following categories each saw an increase of inflation mentions in reviews on Yelp:Beauty services and spas up by 21%Arts and entertainment up by 19%Nightlife up by 17%Hotel and travel businesses up by 11%, particularly related to lodging businessesOn average, retail and event categories related to weddings up by 29%As inflation remains high, users are increasingly searching for budget-friendly dining and grocery optionsIn Q3 2022, searches for budget dining and grocery options are up by 11% from the previous quarter and 9% compared to Q3 2021. Within these searches, Yelp data shows that searches for terms related to affordable groceries were used 67% more often compared with Q2 2022 and 126% more compared to Q3 2021. Additionally, searches related to fast food and fast casual dining are up by 10% compared with Q2 2022 and 8% more compared to Q3 2021.Not all states are turning to these budget options equally. Yelp data shows that the states with the highest increase in searches related to affordable dining and groceries in the past quarter were in Washington D.C. (up 27%), Louisiana (up 26%), New York (up 25%), West Virginia (up 24%), Pennsylvania (up 20%) and Mississippi (up 20%).MethodologyReview Text Mentions of InflationWe analyzed review text from 2020 through Q3 2022 to observe how Yelp consumers are referencing inflation in reviews. These inflation references can include phrases mentioning inflation itself or higher or rising prices at businesses. The volume of review text phrases are normalized to the mention frequency per every million words, and is calculated for each Yelp category and on a national, regional, and state basis. A minimum threshold of review mentions was implemented to uncover the most noteworthy inflation experiences.Consumer searches for budget dining and groceriesBudget dining and groceries searches refer to queries such as ""fast casual,"" ""fast food,"" ""cheap eats,"" and ""cheap grocery store,"" among others. When analyzing the search behavior, we measured the appearance of budget dining and groceries related phrases in every million Yelp searches. We compared the search behavior period over period to inform how consumer dining preferences had changed across locations.About Yelp Inc.Contacts","October 18, 2022 at 11:01 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/q3-yelp-economic-average-finds-040100595.html,Business Wire,0.02500000000000001,0.3,0.06681323034264211,0.4343157060804119
YELP,When Should You Buy Yelp Inc. (NYSE:YELP)?," View our latest analysis for Yelp Yelp appears to be expensive according to my price multiple model, which makes a comparison between the company's price-to-earnings ratio and the industry average. In this instance, I’ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock’s cash flows. I find that Yelp’s ratio of 50.42x is above its peer average of 23.14x, which suggests the stock is trading at a higher price compared to the Interactive Media and Services industry. If you like the stock, you may want to keep an eye out for a potential price decline in the future. Since Yelp’s share price is quite volatile, this could mean it can sink lower (or rise even further) in the future, giving us another chance to invest. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.Future outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Yelp's earnings over the next few years are expected to double, indicating a very optimistic future ahead. This should lead to stronger cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.","October 13, 2022 at 5:13 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buy-yelp-inc-nyse-yelp-101319113.html,Simply Wall St.,0.0,0.0,0.10491666666666669,0.42924999999999996

YELP,Does The Market Have A Low Tolerance For Yelp Inc.'s (NYSE:YELP) Mixed Fundamentals?,"Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. See our latest analysis for Yelp Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Yelp is:6.7% = US$48m ÷ US$719m (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2022).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.07 in profit.We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.When you first look at it, Yelp's ROE doesn't look that attractive. However, its ROE is similar to the industry average of 7.0%, so we won't completely dismiss the company. Having said that, Yelp's five year net income decline rate was 32%. Remember, the company's ROE is a bit low to begin with. Therefore, the decline in earnings could also be the result of this.However, when we compared Yelp's growth with the industry we found that while the company's earnings have been shrinking, the industry has seen an earnings growth of 18% in the same period. This is quite worrisome.Because Yelp doesn't pay any dividends, we infer that it is retaining all of its profits, which is rather perplexing when you consider the fact that there is no earnings growth to show for it. So there could be some other explanations in that regard. For instance, the company's business may be deteriorating.","September 7, 2022 at 8:29 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/does-market-low-tolerance-yelp-132947191.html,Simply Wall St.,0.0,0.275,0.14351851851851852,0.38888888888888895

YELP,Big Techs $95 Million Spending Spree Leaves Antitrust Bill on Brink of Defeat,"(Bloomberg) -- A high-profile push by Congress to rein in the nation’s biggest internet companies is at risk of failing with time running out to pass major legislation ahead of midterm elections.Alphabet Inc.’s Google, Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. and their trade groups have poured almost $95 million into lobbying since 2021 as they seek to derail the American Innovation and Choice Online Act, which has advanced further than any US legislative effort to address the market power of some of the world’s richest companies.After a nearly two-year battle, the bill is now at a critical juncture as the Senate returns this week for a final stretch before the November midterms. Backers of the measure swear they have the necessary votes, yet it’s unclear if they do, and the Senate will be busy with other must-pass spending legislation.The view that momentum for the bill is slowing is based on conversations with nearly two dozen of its supporters and critics -- including policy experts, lobbyists, congressional aides and advocates. One Hill staffer summed it up as a do-or-die moment.“If supporters of this bill had enough votes, it wouldn’t be a bill, it would be a law,” said Matt Schruers, president of the Computer & Communications Industry Association, which represents the major tech companies.Failure would be a setback for politicians, activists and regulators who argue Silicon Valley has too much control over people’s lives. It would mark a huge win for Big Tech, which has argued that the measure would weaken privacy, threaten national security and degrade products that consumers enjoy.Even if this bill falls short, advocates say the attention on this measure has helped build the antitrust movement into something bigger than any one piece of legislation. Sarah Miller, head of the American Economic Liberties Project, an anti-monopoly nonprofit, said she supports the bill and wants to see it pass, but she said this is “not a one-time fight.”“Now is a pretty good moment to move it through,” Miller said of the measure. “Is it the end of the road for bills dealing with big tech monopoly power? No.”Although clipping the wings of tech giants through antitrust reform had support from both Republicans and Democrats during this Congress, a likely GOP majority in the House next year is expected to focus on allegations that internet platforms squelch conservative viewpoints.That’s why tech lobbyists have been trying to run out the clock. Leading Republicans like California’s Kevin McCarthy, who is on track to become Speaker under a GOP majority, have publicly opposed the antitrust push.The legislation’s sponsors can see the window narrowing. Antitrust advocates were expecting a vote before Congress adjourned for four weeks in August. But Schumer told donors in July that it didn’t have enough votes to pass.Minnesota Democrat Amy Klobuchar, who introduced the bill along with Iowa Republican Chuck Grassley, expressed confidence that Majority Leader Chuck Schumer will put the proposal to the ultimate test by asking senators to vote on it now.“Once this bill comes to the floor for a vote, we are confident it will pass,” Klobuchar told Bloomberg News.The bill has 13 co-sponsors in the Senate, where it would need 60 votes to pass and be sent to the House. Supporters like Yelp Inc.’s head of public policy Luther Lowe, a longtime Google critic, argue that enough undecided lawmakers would vote for the measure if it came to the floor.A Schumer spokesperson said he’s working with the bill’s sponsors to find the necessary votes and he still plans to bring it to the floor.The bill was approved by both the House and Senate Judiciary Committees on strong bipartisan votes. Several amendments have addressed concerns about privacy and security issues. What hasn’t killed the bill “has made it stronger,” said Yelp’s Lowe.The measure seeks to restrict the companies from favoring their own products, so that competitors who depend on these platforms to reach consumers wouldn’t be at a disadvantage. That could impact the design of Google Maps, the display of Apple Music on an iPhone or the prominence of Amazon Basics on the company’s e-commerce site.Klobuchar’s staff members are working with several Democratic senators who shared concerns about the bill’s impact on content moderation, according to people familiar with the conversations. Hawaii Democrat Brian Schatz and Oregon Democrat Ron Wyden have pledged to support the bill if changes are made.Still, its path to becoming law isn’t going to get any easier. Congress has to fund the government in September before the next fiscal year begins Oct. 1. And the Senate is planning to be in session for just two weeks in October before midterm elections.“I don’t see it going to the floor,” said Michael Petricone, senior vice president of government affairs at the Consumer Technology Association, a trade group that counts Amazon, Google and Facebook among its members. “With an election coming up, I expect senators to come back and focus on issues that are popular with voters. Tech regulation is not one of those issues.”(Updates with quote from anti-monopoly advocate from seventh paragraph)©2022 Bloomberg L.P.","September 6, 2022 at 12:26 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/big-tech-95-million-spending-172626530.html,Bloomberg,0.0,0.1,0.13574074074074072,0.4583333333333333
YELP,Google to Label Medical Facilities That Provide Abortions,"(Bloomberg) -- Google will now clearly label facilities in the US that provide abortions in search results and in Google Maps, seeking to eliminate confusion between medical clinics and so-called crisis pregnancy centers.If the Alphabet Inc.-owned search giant has confirmation a place offers medical services to terminate a pregnancy, it will say so clearly, with a label such as “provides abortions.” For search results that may be relevant but for which Google doesn’t have confirmation, it will state, “Might not provide abortions,” according to a company spokesperson.The adjustment follows a Bloomberg News analysis that found Google Maps was steering people who searched for abortion clinics to crisis pregnancy centers roughly a quarter of the time. Those centers, with a mission to encourage women to go through with their unwanted pregnancies, dominated results in several states where abortion is restricted or illegal.“When people turn to Google to find local information, we aim to help them easily explore the range of places available so they can determine which are most helpful to them,” a Google representative said in a statement. “For a number of categories where we’ve received confirmation that places offer specific services, we’ve been working for many months on more useful ways to display those results.” The change was reported earlier by TechCrunch. Read more Bloomberg stories about how tech companies are navigating privacy and misinformation challenges in the post-Roe v. Wade worldSince the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, 12 states have criminalized abortion and six have put time limits on the procedure. On Thursday, new bans went into effect in Idaho and Tennessee, and in Texas, abortion is now considered a felony and punishable by up to life in prison. The CPCs target women who are seeking abortions and, once in their facilities, may save their data — which could become useful to prosecutors if the women end up seeking abortions in one of these states.Google has until now failed to eliminate inaccurate results in Maps, cited as a problem by media organizations since at least 2018, when news outlets asked the company to explain why searches were turning up CPCs. Google Maps is the dominant navigation service in the US, with over 118.4 million monthly users in the country and a 56% share of the market among mobile users, according to a recent report from Insider Intelligence. Bloomberg found that people seeking abortions were among those users who were erroneously directed to CPCs.Also this week, Yelp Inc. made a policy change to put disclaimers on CPCs, flagging the centers as places that “provide limited medical services and may not have licensed medical professionals onsite.” The rule will apply to religious and secular CPCs in the US and Canada.(Adds Yelp change in the final paragraph)©2022 Bloomberg L.P.","August 25, 2022 at 1:38 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/google-label-medical-facilities-abortions-180156488.html,Bloomberg,0.0,0.0,0.07182088744588744,0.35382508116883116
YELP,Hybrid work bigger concern' than inflation or recession for commercial real estate: expert,"Commercial real estate is down and hybrid work is a big reason why, according to one real estate executive.According to data from MSCI, commercial real estate transactions fell 22% in the second quarter from a year ago. And while inflation and an economic recession are both weighing heavily on the minds of real estate investors and ""creating some hesitation,"" Marcus and Millichap CEO Hessam Nadji said that it's ""not really a long-term concern.""""The bigger concern is this hybrid work environment,"" he said on Yahoo Finance Live (video above). ""We're seeing a lot of focus on amenities like fitness, child care, and even entertainment to motivate workers to want to come back in at least three days a week, four days a week, whatever it is depending on the company. There's a lot of focus on how to create a reason for people to want to congregate and come back into the office space.""Amid the pandemic, many companies were forced to shift their workplace settings away from strictly in office to remote working environments. As cases began coming down and vaccines became readily available, many companies opted for hybrid work — meaning a mix of both in-person and remote work — for their employees.Hybrid work environments require less capital from companies as workers going into the office just a few days per week require less physical space at work for individual tasks, working with fellow employees, communicating with clients, etc.“Certainly in the office space consumption and new leases that are being signed, we see the hybrid workplace play a big factor in the reduction of footprint and the space needs [new] expectations going forward,” Nadji said.""The overall footprint currently looks to be shrinking,"" Nadji said. ""I think if you look two to four years out, when we have the next economic cycle, with job growth coming and a lack of overbuilding — there's very little overbuilding going on in commercial real estate — I think they're going to offset each other as two factors: one being the reduction of footprint because of hybrid workspace, and then the other being new demand coming into the market.""At the same time, though, Nadji highlighted how some of the fastest-growing companies in the U.S. are either acquiring buildings or the land to build future buildings. Tech companies, in particular, are looking for additional space due to the growing popularity of large data centers.""The composition of space utilization is changing for sure to accommodate for more team and collaboration and less about the individual employee space,"" Nadji said.Additionally, he said, within the commercial real estate industry, clients interested in development have stepped up, ""looking for opportunities to take ... older office buildings and actually older properties in every segment, and improve them, upgrade them, bring them up to the current kind of a configuration that the market seems to need as a really good investment instead of building brand-new projects.""Ethan is a writer for Yahoo Finance.Click here for the latest economic news and economic indicators to help you in your investing decisionsRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance","August 6, 2022 at 1:01 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hybrid-work-a-big-factor-in-companies-reducing-office-space-180105803.html,Yahoo Finance,0.06666666666666667,0.26666666666666666,0.08627522519567975,0.30603272989636626

The perpetrators were able to gain access through a single compromised developer’s account, the company said.The attack struck a company that generates and stores hard-to-crack, auto-generated passwords for multiple accounts, like Netflix or Gmail, on behalf of its users -- without the need to manually enter credentials. LastPass lists Patagonia, Yelp Inc. and State Farm as customers on its website.Cybersecurity website Bleeping Computer reported that it had asked LastPass about the breach two weeks ago.Allan Liska, an analyst on the Computer Security Incident Response Team at cybersecurity company Recorded Future, said he was impressed with the “speedy notification” from LastPass.“While two weeks might seem like a long time to some, it can take a while for incident response teams to fully assess and report on a situation,” he said. “it will take time to fully determine the extent of any damage that may have been as result of the breach. However, for now it appears to not be client-impacting.”LastPass didn’t immediately respond to a request for further comment.There was speculation on social media that hackers may be able to access the keys to password vaults after stealing source code and proprietary information.“It is unlikely that the stolen source code will give the criminals access to customer passwords,” Liska said.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekYouTube Went to War Against Terrorists, Just Not White NationalistsCrypto’s Real Value Was Never $3 TrillionThe Secret Sauce at Hot Chicken Takeover: Its Unique WorkforceThe Search for New Talent Has Companies Welcoming RefugeesChipmaking’s Next Big Thing Guzzles as Much Power as Entire Countries©2022 Bloomberg L.P.","August 25, 2022 at 5:25 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/world-most-popular-password-manager-222507381.html,Bloomberg,0.55,0.7,0.0669877344877345,0.4380014430014429

The top line primarily reflected growth in advertising revenues.Advertising revenues (95% of total revenues) climbed 16% year over year to $284 million.

Restaurants, Retail & Other revenues climbed 18.2% to $109.2 million.Transaction revenues were $4 million in the second quarter, up 12% year over year due to an increase in the per-order transaction fee from Grubhub, partially offset by lower food take-out and delivery order volumes, as several restaurants resumed and increased their dine-in operations.Other revenues jumped 31% to $11 million as the company reduced relief incentives to the pandemic’s most affected customers in the form of waived fees.

other income, net; depreciation and amortization; stock-based compensation expense; and, in certain periods, certain other income and expense items, such as restructuring costs and impairment charges. We define Adjusted EBITDA margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by net revenue.Adjusted EBITDA, which is not prepared under any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles, has limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of Yelp’s financial results as reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (""GAAP""). In particular, Adjusted EBITDA should not be viewed as a substitute for, or superior to, net income (loss) prepared in accordance with GAAP as a measure of profitability or liquidity. Some of these limitations are:although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect all cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements;Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, Yelp's working capital needs;Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the impact of the recording or release of valuation allowances or tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to Yelp;Adjusted EBITDA does not consider the potentially dilutive impact of equity-based compensation;Adjusted EBITDA does not take into account any income or costs that management determines are not indicative of ongoing operating performance, such as restructuring costs and impairment charges; andother companies, including those in Yelp’s industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure.Because of these limitations, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin alongside other financial performance measures, net income (loss) and Yelp’s other GAAP results.The following is a reconciliation of net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA, as well as the calculation of net income (loss) margin and Adjusted EBITDA margin, for each of the periods indicated (in thousands, except percentages; unaudited):Three Months EndedSix Months EndedJune 30,2022March 31,2022June 30,2021June 30,2022June 30,2021Reconciliation of Net Income (Loss) to Adjusted EBITDA:Net income (loss)$8,009$(915)$4,212$7,094$(1,584)Provision for (benefit from) income taxes9,319(2,612)(4,751)6,707(6,893)Other income, net(1,327)(929)(542)(2,256)(1,247)Depreciation and amortization11,25811,49012,83322,74825,916Stock-based compensation40,06141,06040,85981,12180,104Restructuring——12—32——11,164—11,164Adjusted EBITDA$67,320$48,094$63,787$115,414$107,492Net revenue$298,884$276,628$257,188$575,512$489,284Net income (loss) margin3%—%2%1%—%Adjusted EBITDA margin23%17%25%20%22%Contacts","August 4, 2022 at 3:05 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/yelps-strong-advertiser-demand-drove-200500771.html,Business Wire,0.14444444444444443,0.24444444444444444,0.007470172104318437,0.3245908562981734

YELP,7 Small-Cap Stocks to Buy on the Dip,"Generally defined as companies featuring a market capitalization between $300 million to $2 billion, small-cap stocks to buy have always appealed to speculators. Geared for tremendous growth, if you happen to catch one of these exciting ideas at the right time, your portfolio can easily skyrocket. But with the wild volatility we’ve seen in the first half of 2022, many under-the-radar equities are priced even more attractively.Of course, investors should realize that — as with anything in life — the greater the reward potential, the higher the risk. To use a sports analogy, you should consider small-cap stocks to buy on the dip as going for it on fourth down as opposed to kicking a field goal. You should expect your fair share of interceptions and a couple of sacks along the way.7 Surprising Meme Stocks to Buy and Hold in 2022At the same time, some of your bold moves will end up on the highlight reel. If you have the penchant for speculation, then these small-cap stocks to buy could be for you.

Although it has some decent strengths in its balance sheet — such as a cash-to-debt ratio of 1.52x — Warby’s profitability metrics are terrible.True, the company posted revenue of $153.2 million in the first quarter of 2022, a 10% improvement year-over-year. However, investors remain concerned about its widening net losses.Following a brief dip into the spring doldrums of 2020, Fastly quickly rocketed higher. A combination of the grand work-from-home experiment along with quarantined individuals bored out of their mind logging onto streaming platforms simultaneously placed significant strain on internet traffic. The dynamic called Fastly into action, leading to significant gains.7 Best Water Stocks to Buy NowLargely, global recession fears along with the Federal Reserve’s commitment to tackling inflation at (almost) any cost has many industries worried. Naturally, shares of ERO suffered, losing more than 41% year-to-date. Still, the selloff could be overdone.Suddenly, retail pharmacies were the place to be to pick up essential goods and critical over-the-counter medication. If you recall, those were apocalyptic days, with customers fighting each other for otherwise mundane items like toilet paper.Now that fear of the SARS-CoV-2 virus has faded, the pecking order in the industry has emerged, with Rite Aid once again finding itself in the back.7 Best Reddit Stocks to Buy NowOf course, the funk is pretty bad, with HRTG shares down more than 57%. However, one encouraging note is that Heritage posted revenue of $152.9 million in Q1 2022, which was up 7.5% from the year-ago level. Therefore, HRTG could make its way back up the charts.However, many analysts did point out that Hydrofarm is the smarter way to play the legalization business. By offering the equipment people need to expand their agricultural ambitions, Hydrofarm is selling tickets to the game, not a wager on which one team will win out.7 Best Pharmaceutical Stocks to Buy NowThat said, HYFM is one of the riskiest small-cap stocks to buy, having lost 87% YTD. Only gamblers with the strongest conviction need apply.In other words, Wheels Up may have a larger consumer base, making it one of the small-cap stocks to buy on the dip.Buy This $5 Stock BEFORE This Apple Project Goes LiveThe Best $1 Investment You Can Make TodayEarly Bitcoin Millionaire Reveals His Next Big Crypto Trade “On Air”Cash Holders Could Get Hit Hard THIS FRIDAY","July 21, 2022 at 8:56 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-small-cap-stocks-buy-135605242.html,InvestorPlace,0.0,0.0,0.1955667162698413,0.4791170634920636

YELP,Q2 Yelp Economic Average Finds Consumers are Experiencing Inflation at Record Rates and Reporting New Experiences of Shrinkflation,"Amid inflation and rising gas prices, in Q2 consumers seek fewer higher-priced businesses and turn to electric vehiclesIn the first half of 2022, consumers are booking reservations further in advance than ever beforeThe Q2 Yelp Economic Average finds consumers are experiencing inflation at record rates. (Graphic: Business Wire)""Despite rising inflation, activity on Yelp suggests that consumer spending remains strong as people search for higher-priced businesses more frequently than prior to the pandemic,"" said Pria Mudan, data science leader at Yelp. ""However, that doesn’t mean consumers and businesses aren’t feeling the pinch of inflation. We saw reviewers use inflation-related language at record levels, particularly in the dining, arts and entertainment and travel categories. And for the first time, reviewers are describing shrinkflation-related experiences where the size or quantity of goods are noticeably smaller, which is most referenced at restaurants serving more affordable fare.""Consumers Report Inflationary Experiences at Record RatesWhile inflation has been rapidly increasing since 2021, consumers have especially experienced inflation at an increasing rate in 2022, as mentions of inflationary language in Yelp reviews are up 7% in Q2 compared to Q1 of this year. When compared to Q2 2021, consumers are experiencing inflation most at more casual restaurants (up 38%) and food businesses (up 36%), followed by arts and entertainment (up 33%), nightlife businesses (up 30%), event services (up 22%), and hotel and travel businesses (up 20%).However, inflation has not been felt equally across the U.S. In Q2 2022, 47 states (including Washington D.C.) saw an overall increase of inflation mentions in Yelp reviews compared to Q2 2021 – with 35 states seeing more than a 25% increase of inflation mentions. Six of the top 10 states with the highest inflation experiences are in the Northeast, including Massachusetts, New York, Maine, Washington D.C., New Jersey and New Hampshire.Consumer Searches for Higher Priced Businesses Fell, Yet Remain Above Pre-pandemic LevelsIn Q2 2022, the share of all searches on Yelp using the inexpensive ""$"" filter increased by 7% compared to Q1 2022, while the share of the highest ""$$$$"" filter had decreased by 12%. While quarter-over-quarter consumers are generally searching for lower-priced businesses, when compared to pre-pandemic levels (Q2 2019), consumers still searched for higher-priced businesses more frequently in the second quarter of this year. Searches on Yelp using the highest ""$$$$"" filter increased up by 55% in Q2 2022 compared to Q2 2019, whereas the use of the inexpensive ""$"" filter decreased by 24%. While restaurants, food, and travel and hotel searches reflect a similar trend, auto services searches oppose the trend.Consumers are Booking Reservations Further in Advance Than Ever BeforeConsumers Turn to Electric Vehicles in Response to Raising Gas PricesConsumer searches for ""electric vehicles'' (EV) were up 97% in Q2 2022 from the year before, and up 175% compared to pre-pandemic Q2 2019. Additionally, searches for specific EV models were up 63% in Q2 2022 compared to Q2 2021, and up 118% from Q2 2019. EV Charging stations also experienced a 23% increase in consumer interest in Q2 2022 compared to Q2 2021.MethodologyChanges in consumer interest for each category were measured by comparing year-over-year data from Q2 2019-2022, focusing on each category’s share of all consumer actions in its root category.About Yelp Inc.Contacts","July 19, 2022 at 11:01 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/q2-yelp-economic-average-finds-040100886.html,Business Wire,0.062121212121212126,0.3515151515151515,0.1558954933954934,0.4382770007770008
YELP,Here's Why Investors Should Retain Yelp (YELP) Stock for Now,"Let us delve deeper into factors highlighting why investors should hold on to the stock for the time being.Yelp has been gaining from growing advertising revenues primarily driven by increased local salesforce and transition toward non-term advertising. The company has been transforming its business model toward selling advertising plans that have no fixed duration. This is aiding the company in increasing paying advertiser account retention.Yelp Inc. price-consensus-chart | Yelp Inc. QuoteThe online business search, review and recommendation service provider’s sustained focus on portfolio expansion with the launch of Verified License, Business Highlights, Yelp Portfolios, and Yelp Fusion remains a key growth driver. In the first quarter of 2022, subscribing locations for Verified License and Business Highlights increased year over year and boosted the number of paying advertising starts in the Self-Serve channel.Since the launch of Yelp Fusion in May 2020, the company’s Other revenue segment has been witnessing solid growth. The segment reported over 50% growth (year-over-year growth of 62%) in the latest first quarter 2022 results, courtesy of rapid adoption of the Fusion platform along with a reduction in the relief incentives for the most impacted COVID-19 customers in the form of waived fees.A healthy and minimal risk-based balance sheet is likely to continue providing stability and buoyancy over the medium to long term. Backed by a strong balance sheet and solid cash and capital position, Yelp is positioned well to make strategic investments in product development and marketing.The decline in food take-out and delivery order volumes, as several restaurants resumed and increased their dine-in operations following the relaxation in social distancing regulations, is likely to continue hurting its transaction revenues in the near term.Shares of GOOGL, MSFT and META have plunged 25%, 22.9% and 52.5%, respectively, in YTD.","July 5, 2022 at 8:56 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-investors-retain-yelp-135601411.html,Zacks,0.0,0.0,0.12007575757575757,0.4200757575757576
YELP,"Shareholders in Yelp (NYSE:YELP) have lost 32%, as stock drops 8.1% this past week","With the stock having lost 8.1% in the past week, it's worth taking a look at business performance and seeing if there's any red flags. See our latest analysis for Yelp To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).During the last year Yelp grew its earnings per share, moving from a loss to a profit.When a company has just transitioned to profitability, earnings per share growth is not always the best way to look at the share price action. So it makes sense to check out some other factors.Yelp managed to grow revenue over the last year, which is usually a real positive. Since we can't easily explain the share price movement based on these metrics, it might be worth considering how market sentiment has changed towards the stock.The graphic below depicts how earnings and revenue have changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on US exchanges.","July 4, 2022 at 7:45 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/shareholders-yelp-nyse-yelp-lost-124553107.html,Simply Wall St.,-0.25,0.25,0.14718013468013466,0.3366582491582492
YELP,Why the latest round of tech layoffs feels a bit different,"There have been two distinct waves of tech layoffs amid COVID-19, Layoffs.fyi Creator Roger Lee told Yahoo Finance in an interview.And according to Lee, the layoffs are not that surprising: “There’s a lot of uncertainty in the market right now… and companies and startups are trying to be proactive about cutting costs.""A recently-laid off Coinbase employee, who received a bachelor’s in computer science from a highly-ranked university and spoke on the condition of anonymity, told Yahoo Finance that they actively sought out a career in blockchain and joined Coinbase pre-pandemic with high hopes.""I had the best interview experience I'd ever had,"" they said. ""Coinbase really did have a great culture before it went remote.""Though some have worried that this moment in tech is a repeat of the turn-of-the-century dot-com bust, there are some key differences.“There are some similarities to the dot-com bust in 2001, which culled the herd with the exit of Web 1.0 companies that were nothing more than a website with a promise,” Dan Wang, associate professor of business at Columbia Business School, told Yahoo Finance. “Investor expectations were tamed 20 years ago in a way that’s similar to what we’re witnessing now. The big difference, however, was that we were in a pre-digital world 20 years ago. Today, for both consumers and businesses, their livelihoods are fully integrated into digital platforms, which will shorten a potential recovery period.”The extent of layoffs across the industry remains difficult for those caught in the crossfire, emotionally and practically.“In a time like this, when there’s uncertainty about the future, employees who are laid off will be less inclined to take the risk of losing their own savings, or simply don’t have the capital to exercise their stock options,” EquityBee Co-Founder and CEO Oren Barzilai told Yahoo Finance, also estimating that there are about 6 million startup employees in the U.S.Barzilai added that “there are so many stressed out employees who’ve been laid off, and they can’t afford to keep their equity. Eventually they realize that the economy will turn back over into a bull market as the company they helped build goes public or gets acquired. They realize they could have been very wealthy today — it’s happened many times before — and because they couldn’t take the risk or afford to exercise, they lost everything.”Ultimately, the flood of layoffs hitting the tech space signals a fundamental change across the industry, a shift from focusing on growth towards honing in on profitability.“Make no mistake — the tech sector is still bustling with innovation and growth opportunities, but I think at least as far as tech start-ups go, there will be less of a focus on growth and scaling as quickly as possible,” Wang said. “With a recession around the corner, investors — both in the public markets and in venture capital — are looking for more reasonable expectations, and this means rather than focus on growth, companies in the tech sector must turn their attention to achieving profitability as quickly as possible and sustaining it for as long as possible. To meet this urgency, layoffs are unfortunately part of the equation.”Ines Ferre contributed to this report.

YELP,"On abortion access, employers have promises. They need plans.","After the Supreme Court overturned Roe vs. Wade, a wide swath of corporate America came out with a message for its workforce: We will pay to help you get an abortion in a place where it's still available.Would a worker have to tell their employer that they needed an abortion to secure travel reimbursement funds? How would companies ensure workers' privacy? What would they do to protect employees — and themselves — from potential legal attacks, such as those made possible by a Texas law that allows private citizens to sue anyone who “aids and abets” abortion? Would part-time workers and contract workers be covered? And would companies fight to restore the legal status of abortion in the places where it has been lost?So far, the companies making the promises don't seem to have a lot of answers.""The worst thing you can do is promise your employees a benefit and then have no plan to make sure you can actually provide it,"" said Sonja Spoo, director of reproductive rights campaigns at Ultraviolet, a national gender justice advocacy organization. ""Don’t wait until a law passes to figure out what you’re going to do. Start figuring it out now.""Experts and reproductive health advocates said that the new in-house travel reimbursement programs announced by many companies will require erecting safeguards around employee privacy. Without the right ones in place, some doubted that the benefit would be widely used — if at all.""I don’t know that people would feel comfortable calling someone up and saying, 'Hey, I would like to make use of this new abortion leave,'"" said Jen L’Estrange, founder of Red Clover, a human resources firm.Airbnb, Reddit, Snap, Netflix, Yelp, Wells Fargo, Microsoft, Rakuten, Starbucks and EBay are among major companies that said they would offer a travel benefit through their healthcare plans.L’Estrange said there were several things companies could do to ensure workers feel comfortable accessing reproductive care. One way would be the creation of what she termed a ""wellness policy"" that would help workers access out-of-state healthcare of all forms, including but not limited to abortion, and would include generous paid time off, including unplanned sick leave to give workers time to travel and recover. As part of that policy, L'Estrange said, companies could provide a stipend paid to workers at the beginning of the year, ""regardless of whether or not they use it.""""I’d say take it away from the abortion question,"" L'Estrange said. ""You want knee surgery and you want to do it out of state? Great, we will support you in that.""If companies are really serious about providing out-of-state care to workers, several reproductive rights advocates said, they will need to take action both inside and outside the office.The Times asked more than a dozen companies that said they would cover out-of-state abortion care if they had a plan in place for defending against legal challenges, particularly in Texas. Airbnb, Reddit, Snap, Netflix, Microsoft, EBay, Wells Fargo, Dick's Sporting Goods, Starbucks, Amazon, Discord and Boeing didn't answer the question. Only Yelp and Rakuten responded directly.""This is the right thing to do for our employees and we are not concerned about legal risk,"" a Yelp spokesperson said in a statement. ""With more than 200 employees in Texas, we felt it was important that they had consistent access to the health services they needed, no matter where they live.""""I am unable to speculate on theoretical legal questions,"" a spokesperson for Rakuten said in a statement. ""While we do not have an office in Texas, we have about 70 remote employees in the state. We are committed to a unified employee experience where all of our team members can access and enjoy the same benefits, corporate culture, and career opportunities, regardless of where they live or any other identifying factor.""Then there's the bigger question of whether the companies asserting their employees' right to reproductive healthcare are prepared to treat politics as a remedy, putting real money and force behind their promises.Many supporters of reproductive healthcare called for corporations to use their powerful lobbying teams to fight to defeat anti-abortion bills in state legislatures and engage in other political pressure tactics.""One thing corporations can and should do is try to fight back on this by saying we are not going to have jobs in your state, we will not have our conferences in your state,"" said Cary Franklin, law professor at UCLA and faculty director of the Center on Reproductive Health, Law and Policy. ""It’s not just states that have power over corporations. Corporations have leverage too.""Advocates also said corporate political giving should be brought in line with public declarations of supporting employees' access to reproductive care.""You can’t on one hand fund these extremists and then beg forgiveness for your sins by paying for your folks to go out of state for care,"" said Spoo, of Ultraviolet. ""Corporate America’s contributions to anti-abortion politics have led us to this moment. They are absolutely on the hook for getting us out of it by pulling their funding from the politicians who are actively working to roll back our rights.""Political action such as supporting candidates who favor Medicaid expansion would have the potential benefit of improving healthcare access for those who aren't covered through their jobs — a group that includes many part-time and contract workers at the companies that have announced new benefits.Providing reproductive care that includes abortion supports workers' health and their careers, said Franklin, the UCLA law professor. ""But 75% of people in this country who get abortions are poor and low-income and they don’t work for major corporations. They don’t have jobs with Microsoft.""Corporations paying for out-of-state reproductive care was ""fine"" but ""not the solution,"" said Eileen Appelbaum, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research. Because so many women are left out of the equation, Appelbaum said, ""the best solution [for corporations] is to contribute to a reproductive healthcare fund.""The Times asked companies if they had donated to such funds, but most didn't answer. A Yelp spokesperson said in a statement that the Yelp Foundation double-matched employee donations to organizations fighting anti-abortion legislation in Texas and elsewhere, as well as organizations such as the Center for Reproductive Rights, NARAL Pro Choice America, Lilith Fund, Planned Parenthood and Planned Parenthood of Greater Texas.Appelbaum believes corporations will have a harder time hiring women in states where abortion is illegal. Workers want to know that they will have the healthcare they need in all kinds of scenarios — a life-threatening ectopic pregnancy, for example, or an incomplete miscarriage that could lead to sepsis. It may not be clear until it's too late when ""life of the mother"" exceptions to abortion bans apply. ""Women will seek out companies in states where they don’t have to worry about this,"" Appelbaum said.Ultimately, laws banning basic reproductive healthcare will lead to a situation in which ""the economies of those states will really suffer,"" Appelbaum said. ""Educated women who have options will not stay in those states. There will be a lot of people voting with their feet.""","June 30, 2022 at 3:22 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/companies-theyll-help-employees-access-202210587.html,LA Times,0.0,0.0,0.08725591784102422,0.3971773203156183

YELP,SCOTUS abortion ruling: Employers expand mental health benefits for workers following decision,"Yahoo Finance reporter Allie Canal joins the Live show to examine which companies are offering more mental health resources and benefits to employees after the Roe v. Wade decision, and how workplaces can be ""psychologically safe"".But what happens after, especially as it relates to mental health? Because the American Psychological Association did say that overturning Roe v. Wade would, quote, as you mentioned, ""exacerbate"" the mental health crisis that America is already experiencing. They cited several decades of scientific research that shows that those that are denied abortions, they have lower levels of self-esteem, lower quality of life, higher stress, higher anxiety, compared to those who are able to safely access the procedure.So I had the chance to speak with workplace happiness expert, Jenn Lim. And she told me that it's important that these companies create a culture of psychological safety. So what exactly does that mean? It means that leaders today need to facilitate a workplace that allows for honest, diverse conversations with managers and coworkers. They need to hire outside coaches for non-biased opinions, especially if workers feel a bit uncomfortable going to their co-workers or managers with such personal information.And they also need to actively uphold these company values and hold everyone accountable to them. So that means calling things out when it's not being done, celebrating it when it is. So really being active. Because she told me that it's really easy for these companies to just release a PR sound bite when something like this happens. But you need to have actionable steps forward.So I did reach out to a lot of the companies that came out on Friday to see what their plans were for mental health. A lot of these companies actually already had mental health initiatives in place. So we can take a look at Netflix, Warner Brothers Discovery, Lyft. They all told me that they really offer a wide range of services, access to mental health programs, free therapy sessions, paid time off, as well as extra recharge days to really encourage these employees to take time off of work, recharge their mind, recharge their mental health. But I do think there is more that needs to be done, especially in the wake of a decision like this.That was a really big point that Jenn Lim told me. She said it's not enough to just have these conversations, to just put out these consumer surveys or company surveys and ask what you want. You need to listen. You need to reiterate what they said to you. And then you move forward from there. So I just think there needs to be more transparency in the workplace. And that starts from the top.","June 28, 2022 at 2:46 PM",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/scotus-abortion-ruling-employers-expand-194614985.html,Yahoo Finance Video,-0.05,0.15000000000000002,0.13131587615283274,0.4270833333333333
YELP,"Microsoft, Netflix offer LGBTQ care in addition to abortion travel benefits","Yahoo Finance's Allie Garfinkle discusses why companies are beginning to offer travel benefits for gender-affirming care and LGBTQ health care as well as reproductive care.[MUSIC PLAYING]So, on one hand, you have companies like Microsoft and Netflix preparing for the worst, frankly, wanting to cover everything off the cuff. Those two companies in particular have explicitly said that they want to offer gender affirming care, in addition to reproductive care.So I think there are a couple of other things happening. The first is that there's been a flood of anti-LGBTQ bills introduced this year in state legislatures, about 300. And dozens of these bills have targeted access to gender affirming medical care. And on the other hand, we also have a moment where tech companies are really worried about retaining talent. And they want to present to their employees as supportive in a moment where talent across the industry is still in a massive reshuffle.And again, I want to hit the talent piece again. Tech companies are in such a tough spot right now, in more ways than one. The cultural and legal divide in this country is creating a lot of difficulties for companies that want to operate nationally. And the exact thing the expert said to me is, if they want to retain their talent, they've got to do something.But the reality is, there's also a data privacy issue at play, too. So for some of these companies, we'll see what they actually do. Even if they're offering reproductive care, trans care, they still may hand over data that actually contradicts that belief. So we'll see.","June 28, 2022 at 10:04 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/microsoft-netflix-offer-lgbtq-care-150423950.html,Yahoo Finance Video,0.0,0.0,0.04281537176274018,0.4071428571428571
YELP,"Midterm elections, employer abortion benefits: What to watch in D.C. this week","Yahoo Finance Contributor Kevin Cirilli joins the Live show to discuss the latest political news from Washington, D.C., this week.For more on this, let's bring in Yahoo Finance contributor Kevin Cirilli, joining us from the nation's capital. Kevin, what are you seeing, hearing on the ground there? Obviously, a lot of day two, day three, day four kind of follow-ups to that massive news last Friday. What do you think is the big takeaway now that we've had a few days to process all this?And again, that Kavanaugh confirmation mobilized Democrats to get to the polls in the midterm elections, and 40 seats flipped in 2018 from Republican to Democrat. So clearly, Democrats are hoping that their coalition that they were able to put together in states like Colorado, Pennsylvania, and other states in the 2020 presidential election, including mobilizing some of those pro-choice voters, will-- that this decision will mobilize them to get to the polls in the midterm elections.In a state like Pennsylvania, where a state legislator, Doug Mastriano, who has referred to abortion as, quote unquote, ""genocide,"" who has expressed support for making abortion illegal as early as six weeks, this is going to draw a sharp contrast with someone like the Democratic gubernatorial nominee, Josh Shapiro, the state's attorney general who has expressed support for abortion. So in a battleground state like Pennsylvania at the governor level, where now so many Americans are realizing their state legislators and their governors are really going to be-- play a crucial role in this, this is ultimately another fallout from the decision.And then, of course, the business community reaction. This is important. South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem was on CBS News over the weekend speaking to Margaret Brennan. And she was pressed about whether or not she would go against the business community. So many businesses in the last couple of days have come out and said that they would allow to provide funding, should a female want to seek an abortion in a state where it is illegal, to provide transportation in order to go and seek an abortion. Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan, was one of the first, if not the first, CEOs to come out.And Governor Noem said that she was not looking to go to battle against the business community. That said, traditionally, where these issues have popped up in the past, I'm thinking, of course, of marriage equality in the state of Indiana back when former vice president Mike Pence was governor, the business community has really played a role in forcing these issues in a way, quite frankly, that sometimes Washington can't do.But we spoke with Representative John Garamendi from California last week. And he said, look, this is going to be a difficult thing to get through the Senate. So when they say, we're going to do everything that we can to kind of address this, I mean, how much power does the Democratic-- narrowly Democratic Congress have before the midterms?But now that it has taken effect, do they have a plan? Do the states have a plan now that this has been overturned? And I think that is something specifically that you're going to see Democrats really hone in on in states like South Dakota, and of course, in battleground states like Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, and Colorado. Remember back in Colorado, where women's reproductive rights was front and center in 2016, and Senator Gardner was able to hold on to his seat. But again, a fascinating issue that was forced back in 2016.","June 27, 2022 at 10:39 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/midterm-elections-employer-abortion-benefits-153942666.html,Yahoo Finance Video,0.0,0.0,0.08421442687747038,0.43759057971014487

YELP,Companies announce abortion benefits as trigger bans take effect in some states,"Yahoo Finance’s Alexis Keenan joins the Live show to discuss corporate America's response to abortion care after Congress overturned Roe v. Wade.And that's going to be really important here. Now, over the weekend-- this is since the ruling came out on Friday-- you have Guttmacher Institute, a pro-abortion rights advocate, saying that nine states had already gone ahead and let their trigger bans go into place. Those are the ones making abortion illegal in the states.You have Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, and Utah all taking those steps. That's out of 26 states that are expected or likely to have either limitations or bans on abortion to go into effect post overturning of Roe v Wade. Now, there is also been a letter that has been issued by 29 so far state and federal prosecutors saying that they will not prosecute these new laws. That includes prosecutors in states that have already put these bans into place.So certainly not limited to abortions, but allows employees to take advantage of it for that. You also have questions about whether states will choose to prosecute companies that provide these types of services. You had Texas state lawmakers already floating the idea that they would pass a bill saying that companies that provide this type of benefit that they'll make it illegal for those companies to do business in Texas that do so.However, lawyers that are experts in this area, they say that federal law, particularly under Arista for companies that provide their own plans for their workers, that they're going to have a hard time keeping the state-- or at least making the state not able to go ahead and kind of get its hands into this area. Federal law will probably protect these employers to be able to implement these plans.","June 27, 2022 at 8:46 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/companies-announce-abortion-benefits-trigger-134636339.html,Yahoo Finance Video,0.0,0.0,0.04314362108479755,0.5836707410236822

I just want to take a look at that stock chart because their stock shot up 9% on the heels of that news.

So that's something to watch.And if we're talking about talent and the workforce at large, this could actually have a pretty detrimental impact to women re-entering the workforce. So there is a lot to watch here.And if we take a specific look at how this could impact women, you're seeing on your screen there that if state level abortion restrictions were eliminated, so this is opposite of what we're seeing right now, it's estimated that more than 500,000 women would re-enter the labor force, earning an annual income of $3 billion. That's earnings overall. It would also increase the labor participation rate for Black and Hispanic women, increase national GDP levels.

YELP,How the Supreme Court Roe v. Wade decision impacts women in the workforce,"Yahoo Finance's Allie Canal breaks down the economic impacts of abortion restrictions and how it is likely to affect women in the workforce.What happens now? It could be a big impact for women, particularly women rejoining-- or joining the workforce, for that matter. Joining us with details, Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal. Allie, you've been looking into this issue because this was expected ever since we got the leaked draft opinion of this. So what should we be looking at here in terms of women in the workforce?Even to this day, there are still 2 million fewer women in the workforce now than at the start of the pandemic due in large part to those caretaking responsibilities. IWPR had some few interesting stats when it comes to the monetary fallout from all of this. According to them, they said that state-level abortion restrictions cost state economies $105 billion per year. That's due to a reduction in the labor force, a reduction in earnings levels, in addition to increased turnover and time off all for women between the ages of 15 and 44 years old. And C. Nicole told me that those numbers will only be exacerbated by this decision.And then conversely, if we take a look at what would happen if state-level abortion restrictions were eliminated, you can see that more than 500,000 women would enter the labor force earning $3 billion annually. We'd also see Black and Hispanic women seeing an even larger impact on labor force participation rates. National GDP levels would also rise, the group estimating a boost of 0.5% on average.So there are clearly economic benefits to this. And I think it's interesting to think, too, that there's been a lot of research done on this. And about 3/4 of women will probably find other states to get abortions. But that leaves a quarter of women, who for a variety of reasons, money, travel restrictions, won't be able to do that. And that lack of choice is going to set them back economically. And that could create a cycle of poverty.","June 24, 2022 at 10:22 AM",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/supreme-court-roe-v-wade-152246355.html,Yahoo Finance Video,0.0,0.0,0.09926046176046176,0.42427849927849937
